{"conversations": ["How to start a food delivery business?", "Food-delivery businesses are a popular and fast-growing field. These businesses typically thrive in college towns, large cities, or other areas where large populations of adults are willing to pay to have food from restaurants delivered to them. The basic business model for this type of business is to approach local restaurants and ask to deliver their food, then charge a small commission for your company's profit. Build a small fleet of delivery drivers, and set up a website or app that your clients can use to order.\n\n## Strategizing and register your business\n\n1. Structure your business as an LLC to protect your finances. There are a variety of ways to structure a small business, but an LLC is one of the most common since it allows you to keep personal finances and business finances separate. To form your LLC, you'll need to file \u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d with your state's secretary of state. Also, make sure that your company's name ends in \u201cLLC\u201d and open a bank account under the company's name. Most LLCs are \u201cmember-managed,\u201d meaning that all of the LLC's owners take an equal share in managing the company. If you were to not structure your business as an LLC, the bank (or other debtors) could come after your personal finances and savings if your business went bankrupt.\n2. Find a source to finance your business if necessary. When you're starting up your business, you may need financing in order to purchase delivery vehicles, rent office space, and pay for insurance and permits. If this is the case, finance your business by taking out a bank loan. Or, see if you can find prospective investors who may be interested in a chunk of your company's future stock. On the other hand, if you have several thousand dollars in savings and plan to start with just 2\u20133 drivers (with their own vehicles) and yourself, you probably don't need any financing.\n3. Select a catchy name that will stick in your customers' minds. You only get 1 chance to name your business, so make sure to select a name that describes your company. The name itself should also clue people in to some of your business's selling points. A clever name is also a great way to set yourself apart from some of your competitors. For instance, if you want to alert potential customers to your affordably-priced meals, use a word like \u201caffordable\u201d or \u201cbudget\u201d in your company name. Avoid bland or forgettable names like \u201cChicago Lunch Delivery.\u201d Instead, try something snappier, like, \u201cOn-Time People Food Delivery,\u201d \u201cSandwich in a Crunch Delivery,\u201d or \u201cFine Dining 2 You Food Delivery.\u201d\n4. Register your business with your state and local governments. Before you can begin conducting any business, you'll need to register your delivery company. Specifically, you need to register the business name with your local (and maybe state) government. If you live in the U.S., start the registration process by visiting the website for the secretary of state for the state you reside in. You'll also need to register to obtain a federal tax ID number. Registering your business name prevents others from using it. Registration also ensures that you'll receive legal and tax benefits as well as personal liability protection.\n5. Buy general liability insurance and any other kinds your state requires. Nearly all large insurance companies offer general liability business insurance. Speak to a representative from the company of your choice and ask them what level of insurance you're required to have in order to comply with state guidelines. Besides general liability, many states also require that you obtain workers' compensation insurance to protect the livelihoods of your employees.\n6. Obtain the required permits and licenses to operate in your state. If you live in the U.S., the licenses and permits you'll need in order to run a food-delivery business will vary from state to state. The state permits you need will also with your business's location and activities. Figure out which permits and licenses you'll need by checking out your state's secretary of state website. Your insurance company representative should also be able to advise you regarding the permits you'll need to file for. There may also be various fees associated with obtaining the permits and licenses. Unless you're planning to deliver alcoholic beverages, you shouldn't need to obtain any federal licenses.\n7. Calculate an operating budget for your delivery business. Add up all of your business's prospective expenditures, including renting office space (if applicable), driver salaries, insurance, and gas/vehicle costs. Offset these by calculating your business's prospective income. Figure out how much money you can afford to spend on a monthly basis without going into the red. You can further break the budget up by separating necessary expenses (e.g., rent) from optional expenses (e.g., extra advertising) and finding ways to spend less on the optional expenses. As with any kind of business startup, you won't begin turning a profit right away. It may take a couple of years. Broadly speaking, startup costs for a food-delivery business average between $3,000-$25,000 USD. In most cases, this money will need to come out of your pocket. Also factor your employees' salaries into your budget. While you may start out paying delivery drivers minimum wage, advertising and graphic-design specialists will need salaries. Do some research online to calculate reasonable salary amounts that exceed the annual cost of living in your area.\n\n\n## Partner and arrange deliveries\n\n1. Cater to a specific market and demographic that you'd like to work with. Consider your potential client base. This will influence the type of restaurants that you approach about delivering their food. If you're undecided, drive around the area you live in and take note of the types of restaurants\u2014and restaurant clients\u2014that you see. Especially when you're first starting out, it makes sense to capitalize on the food markets that are already in place. This will also help you find a niche for your business, rather than attempting to serve too broad of a market. For example, ask yourself things like:\n\t* Do you want to sell cheap eats to hungry college kids? Or would you rather deliver gourmet meals to upscale town home residents? Alternately, would you prefer to deliver affordable lunches to businesspeople in an office-heavy district?\n2. Map out the delivery area that you'd like to serve. Whether you live in a large city or are delivering in a rural area, you'll need to decide on a reasonably-sized delivery area. Clients will expect your company to deliver their food promptly (within, say, 15\u201330 minutes), so you can start by setting a 15-minute radius around your delivery headquarters. Pick 2 or 3 neighborhoods and expand from there. Honing in on 1 or 2 specific parts of town is a great way to build a niche for your business. Even if people across town haven't heard of your company, people in the neighborhoods you cater to will be familiar with your delivery service! You can also decide on a delivery area based on the location of the people you hope to deliver to. For example, if you'll deliver fast lunches to busy businesspeople, look into focusing on densely-concentrated business centers or corporate campuses. Or, if you want to deliver late-night food to college kids, center your deliveries around student housing and affordable apartments in student-heavy areas of town.\n3. Meet with restaurant managers to discuss delivery partnerships. Start small by selecting 2 or 3 local restaurants that you think would appeal to your target audience. Ideally, the restaurants should be centrally located within your delivery area. Call and ask to meet with the manager. When you meet, explain that you're starting a food-delivery business to a lucrative audience and that you'd like to deliver their food. Explain to the managers that you won't be taking money from them; rather, you'll be establishing a partnership that should increase their profits. For example, if you're focusing on an upscale audience, start out by delivering food from a local 3- and 4-star restaurants. Avoid reaching out to chain restaurants, and instead focus on a diverse representation of your city's fine dining. Make it clear to the restaurants that your company holds many of the same values that their does. For example, explain that your company cares about healthy food access and food sustainability. Also ask each manager for a copy of the restaurant's menu to post on your website.\n4. Set a reasonable commission to receive on each order delivered. Food-delivery businesses make money by receiving a commission from the orders they deliver. But, the restaurants still need to make money off of the food they sell. When you sit down with each restaurant manager, hash out a commission amount that will let you keep your business afloat but not keep the restaurant from making profits. Try calculating various commission percentages based on the total amount of sales you hope to make in 1 month. The restaurant itself will pay the commission to your food-delivery business. For example, you may figure out that a 15% commission allows both you and the restaurant(s) to turn a profit. On the other hand, a 20% commission might cut too deeply into the restaurant's profits and a 10% commission might not allow your company to balance its budget.\n5. Choose a flat-rate delivery fee to charge customers on all orders. A flat-rate delivery fee, paid by your customers, will help your business turn a profit and can be used to pay your drivers. Select a low enough dollar amount that it won't deter customers from ordering food in the first place! Setting a delivery fee of $5\u20137 USD would be a good starting point. It would also be wise to set a minimum order amount. For example, you could require that customers pay at least $15 USD for their delivered meal.\n6. Designate a location to serve as the hub of your delivery business. Your business will need to have a headquarters, from which you can dispatch drivers and too which they'll return after each delivery. It's fine if this location is initially in your garage or out of the back of your apartment. However, as the company grows, be on the lookout for cheap office space or a cheap storefront to rent. This will allow you to expand and grow the business. Specify this primary location on your business cards and website so your customers know roughly where you're based. As your company grows, you can also set up offices for on-site personnel who aren't directly associated with food delivery (e.g., web specialists and advertisers).\n7. Hire delivery drivers who can start delivering food to clients. Delivery drivers will form the backbone of your delivery company, so you'll need to hire several before you can start delivering food. When you bring in the prospective drivers to interview them, make sure that each of the drivers has their own car and a legal driver's license. Ask the prospective hires about their availability, and make sure they understand that the majority of their working hours would fall on nights and weekends. It would also be wise to run a background check on each of the drivers to make sure they don't have a criminal history. If you're a student or live in a college town, try posting \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d ads in your student or local newspaper. If you'd like to hire more drivers\u2014say, 20\u201330 people\u2014post a job ad online in forums like Indeed and Monster to attract many applicants.\n8. Post job ads and hire people to fill other key company positions. Your food-delivery business will need an accountant to handle financial issues and a graphic-design specialist to come up with a company logo and design the website. As your driver base grows, you may need someone to oversee all of the drivers and manage their schedules, and someone to handle PR with the restaurants. Try posting job ads online through LinkedIn, Monster, and Indeed to find qualified individuals to hire. If you're starting the business out as a tiny, at-home operation, you may be able to fill all of these positions by yourself initially. However, the sooner you hire other employees, the faster your business will be able to grow and profit.\n\n\n## Deliver food and advertise your business\n\n1. Develop a website that lets users select a restaurant and purchase food. When your business is first starting out, the website can be straightforward. It should clearly present the different restaurant options whose food your business can deliver. After users select an option, the website can present the delivery options, each marked clearly with a price tag. Then, let users select their delivery address and entire their payment info to conclude each order. Design your website so that it's visually appealing and user friendly. If you don't know anything about coding, don't worry. There are plenty of website hosting pages that let you build websites for free. Check out options like Wix and WordPress.\n2. Create a companion app that functions similarly to the website. Many users\u2014especially younger people\u2014prefer to order their food via app, rather than using a web browser. It's okay if you launch your business without the app in place, but aim to get the app up and running within the first 6 months. Like the webpage, the app should allow customers to select their restaurant and food options, input a delivery address, and pay using a credit card. The Apple and Android app stores are the most popular, so start by making your app available on those markets. Let users download the app for free at first. Once your business starts turning a profit and becomes well known, you can charge for the app if you like.\n3. Establish pickup and delivery workflows for incoming orders. The workflow process should be streamlined and set in stone before you start taking orders. Once a customer places an order online, someone from your business will need to call the respective restaurant and place the order. Then, dispatch a driver to pick up the food and deliver it to the customer. If the restaurants you're working with have sophisticated-enough computer systems, you may also be able to link their computers with the app and website directly. This will save you (or another employee) from having to relay customers' orders over the phone.\n4. Market your business through social media accounts. Social media is a great\u2014and free\u2014way to spread the word about your up-and-coming food-delivery business. Start with Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Reach out and like, follow, and friend people you know on all 3 platforms. Then, start posting! You can post pictures of your drivers, photos of tasty-looking meals, and screenshots of your website. Invite customers to leave positive reviews of your business in the \u201cComments\u201d section of Facebook and Instagram to build up your online credibility. You could also advertise your business in local papers, or create a radio ad to air on local stations.\n5. Advertise your business through flyers and physical mailers. Online advertising is great, but you should have physical ads as well. Print out flyers and staple or tape them to telephone poles throughout the neighborhoods you'd like to deliver food to. Also try plastering your company's logo all over your delivery containers and menus! Consider printing stickers that have your company's name or logo on them, and placing 1 or 2 in each delivery bag.\n6. Post ads at the locations of restaurants you've partnered with. As long as you're already in business with 2\u20133 restaurants around town, take advantage of their store space by putting up ads. For example, pin a few flyers on the store bulletin board. Or, ask the store if they can paint their windows to display your company's logo or name. You could even see if the store would be willing to pass out your fliers with every order they sell. Of course, make sure to get the store manager's permission before putting up any ads.\n7. Place advertisements in local community papers and newsletters. You want to get your company's advertisements in front of as many people's eyes as possible. Community newsletters and locally-circulated papers are great venues to use. They're cheaper to advertise in than widely-circulated papers. Plus, you can target your advertisements to the specific areas you'd like to deliver food to. For example, say you often deliver breakfasts and lunches to a large corporate campus. Reach out to the campus administrator and find out if they have an employee newsletter than you could place an ad in.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An entrepreneur or small business owner with a passion for the food industry, seeking to expand their business ventures into the food delivery sector.

Pretend to think hard for a moment, then write down the number 3 on a piece of paper. Fold the paper in half, without letting anyone see the number.\n3. Ask your friend to write down a number between 1 and 20. She should pick this secretly and keep the piece of paper. We'll go through an example, where your friend secretly picks the number 4. This trick works with any number, but keeping it between 1 and 20 makes it less likely that your friend will make a mistake.\n4. Instruct her to add 1 to her number. Warn her not to give you any sign, not even moving her lips. All you need is your mental powers. For example, if she chose 4, her new number is 4 + 1 = 5.\n5. Tell your friend to double the new number. Have her take the last number she had, and multiply it by 2. 5 x 2 = 10.\n6. Have her add 4 more. Put your hands to your head and concentrate, then tell her to add 4 to her last answer. 10 + 4 = 14.\n7. Divide by 2. Tell her you almost have it, but the number is too big for you to see. Ask her to divide it by 2 to make it easier. 14 \u00f7 2 = 7.\n8. Subtract the original number. Ask your friend to look at the piece of paper she used to remind herself what the original number was. Take the last answer she had and subtract that original number. 7 - 4 = 3.\n9. Show her your prediction. Tell her you've finally read her mind. Ask her to announce the last number she ended up with. Once she has, unfold your piece of paper and reveal the 3 you wrote down. No matter which number she started with, her answer will be 3.\n\n\n## Guess someone's age\n\n1. Tell someone you're going to find his age. Let him know you'll be using your mathematical mind-reading abilities. Give him a calculator if he doesn't want to do the calculations in his head. This trick won't be too impressive with close friends or classmates, since you probably already know their age. Pick someone at least 10 years old and no more than 99 years old.\n2. Ask him to multiply the first digit in his age by five. Remind him to do the math silently, to keep his age secret from you. For example, if he is 32 years old, he should take the 3 and multiply it by 5. The answer is 3 x 5 = 15.\n3. Add 4 to his answer. Tell him to add 4 to the answer he found. In our example, he would silently add 15 + 4 = 19.\n4. Tell him to double his answer. Now your subject should multiply his last answer by 2, and let you know when he's finished. If he's doing the math in his head, ask him \"Are you sure?\" since people are most likely to make a mistake on this step. 19 x 2 = 38.\n5. Have him add the second digit of his age. Next, the person you're \"mind reading\" adds the last number in his age. Tell him this is the last calculation he needs to do. Since the subject of our example is 32 years old, he would add 2 to his last answer. His last answer was 38, so he calculates 38 + 2 = 40.\n6. Ask for his last answer. Have him say the final number out loud, so you and everyone in the room can hear it.\n7. Subtract 8 and tell him his real age. Silently subtract 8 from the number he gave you. The answer is his age, which you should announce to the room. In our example, 40 - 8 = 32.\n8. Try some variations. If you perform this trick more than once, people might figure out how it works. Here are a couple variations to keep it mysterious:\n\t* Instead of adding 4 and later (secretly) subtracting 8, you can add 3 and subtract 6, or add 2 and subtract 4, or even add 25 and subtract 50. Just remember you'll need to subtract twice as much as the original number, because it got doubled in one of the later steps. To really switch it up, try this: double your age, add 2, multiply by 5, and subtract 10. You need both the doubling and multiplication by five to move the first digit of his age (3 in our example) to the tens place where it belongs (3 x 2 x 5 = 30).\n\n\n## Magical 37\n\n1. Hand a volunteer a pencil and paper. This one involves some three digit numbers, so most people will not want to do the math in their head. Warn the volunteer that he will need to do long division.\n2. Ask him to write the same digit 3 times. Tell him to hide the paper from you to prove you're not cheating. Ask him to write a 3-digit number that repeats the same digit three times. For example, he could write 222.\n3. Instruct him to add each digit together. Now your volunteer should treat each of the three digits as a separate number, and find their sum. For example, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n4. Tell him to divide the larger number by the smaller one. He should now take the 3-digit number, and divide it by the\\ smaller one. Give him some time to work this out. 222 / 6 = 37,\n5. Announce that his number is 37. As long as your volunteer followed the instructions correctly, his answer will always be 37.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A curious and creative individual, possibly a magician, mentalist, or a magic enthusiast, seeking to expand their repertoire of tricks and impress their audience.

{"conversations": ["How to deal with diagnosis of a rare chromosome disorder in a child?", "Most people have heard of Down syndrome. But there are hundreds of other chromosome disorders a child can have, many of which are diagnosed in only a few children, or may even be unique to that child.\n\n## Get information\n\n1. Learn about genetics. Most people have 46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. One pair is the sex chromosomes, which in males is usually XY and in females XX. The other 22 pairs, known as autosomes, are numbered by size, with chromosome 1 being the biggest. Each chromosome has a longer arm, called the q arm, and a shorter arm, called the p arm. Each arm has bands that are numbered, with the band closest to the middle (centromere) being numbered 11.1. Terminus (shortened to \"ter\") refers to a tip of a chromosome. A \"terminal\" chromosome disorder is not fatal; it just involves the terminus. Learn about the types of changes. Nullisomy means that there are zero copies of a chromosome. Deletion/monosomy means that there is only one copy of the chromosome or piece of chromosome. Duplication/trisomy means that there are 3 copies. Tetrasomy and pentasomy refer to 4 and 5 copies, respectively. Translocations are when chromosomes swap material. If it is balanced, this means the same number of copies of material is present, but they are arranged differently - for example they have part of 3q on 2q and part of 2q on 3q, but it all adds up to the same thing. If it is unbalanced, the child has trisomy and/or monosomy for some part of the involved chromosomes. Very often, an unbalanced translocation is inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation, but it can also occur as a new mutation, which is called 'de novo'. For example, they may have part of 2q missing and part of 3q in its place, causing partial monosomy of 2q and partial trisomy of 3q. In an unbalanced translocation, the abnormal chromosome is called the derivative chromosome, or der for short. So they may write t(2;3)der(2) to indicate the child has the 2 with chromosome 3 material instead of the 3 with chromosome 2 material.\n2. Find medical information on your child's condition. There may not be much out there, but find what you can, because it can give you an idea what to expect for your child. Be careful to pay attention to what specific chromosome region is affected, including what bands are involved - even though they both have 22q deletion, kids with 22q11 deletion have a totally different syndrome from 22q13 deletion. Also keep in mind duplication/trisomy versus deletion/monosomy, because these are genetic opposites. When reading medical case studies, remember that they focus on the negative. You're probably not going to hear the doctor talk about how sweet and caring the child is, or how much their parents feel lucky for knowing them, because it's not medically relevant. You will learn about some of the health problems your kid could face.\n3. See if parents have written about your child's condition. Depending on how rare the condition is, there may be other parents out there who have written about what it is like to raise a child who has it.\n4. Look for adults with your child's condition. Many adults with genetic disabilities are able to use computers when they become adults. Do any of them have blogs or social media accounts? They may be able to offer good advice. Here are some benefits of learning from adults with disabilities:\n\t* They can tell you about the parenting strategies that did and didn't help. They may be able to offer detailed advice about your child. Watching them can help you envision what your child's life will be like someday.\n\n\n## Cop\n\n1. Don't assume the worst. Many doctors, when they don't know the prognosis for a condition, will act like it's more severe than it really is. Even parents of kids with very mild chromosome disorders have been told their child will never walk or talk and/or will die in infancy. If your child has a rare syndrome, take dire prognoses with a grain of salt.\n2. Recognize that infancy is the worst time. For many chromosomal conditions, the first year or two of life are the hardest, as caregivers and healthcare providers try to figure out the child's needs. It won't always be this bad, and it's likely to get easier. If you've been told that your child may die, recognize that extreme early death usually happens in the first 3 years of life, or not at all. If your child is fine at age 4, they'll probably be fine at age 24 and age 44.\n3. Give yourself time to process. You may feel a range of emotions as you realize that your child's life will look different than you thought it would. This is normal. Don't expect yourself to adjust immediately.\n4. Tell other people how they can support you. People around you may want to help, but not know what they can do. Let them know what your family needs, and give them the opportunity to help. \"Between all the doctor appointments, we barely have time to cook. It would be really nice to have someone prepare a meal or maybe invite us for dinner once in a while.\" \"We could really use a babysitter on weekends.\" \"We're so busy for with the baby that the kids can feel left out. If they could go to your house to play with your kids sometimes, it might help cheer them up.\" \"I'm really worried about the upcoming surgery. My wife can't be there due to her conference. It would really help to have someone there with me.\"\n5. Make peace with the fact that life will be different. Your child is going to learn differently, behave differently, and show you how much they love you differently. Sometimes it will be harder, but there will also be beautiful parts. Remember that not every quirk is a deficit. Some differences are positives, and others are neither good nor bad. It's okay for your child to be unique.\n6. Take time for yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup, and you can't help your child much if you're physically and emotionally exhausted. Try to set aside a little \"me time\" each day, even if it's only 5 minutes. Ask yourself \"What would help me feel better right now?\" Could it be a shower? A cup of tea? A hug? Try to get it.\n\n\n## Move forward\n\n1. Seek out parent support groups. If you can find other parents of kids with the same or overlapping chromosome disorders, great, but even parents of kids with completely different conditions can be a great source of support. UNIQUE has leaflets on many rare conditions.\n2. Get therapy early. Early intervention is important. As soon as your child is medically stable, sign them up for physical, occupational and/or speech therapy - even if they are still a tiny baby. This will help them reach their full potential. Although very few kids with chromosome disorders are so affected that they can't walk or talk, most have some degree of cognitive or learning disability. The more they can do for themselves, the less support they will need from others in adulthood. Take notes during therapy and ask for activities that you can do at home. Bad therapists do exist. If a therapist tells you to be cruel or punitive towards your child, find a new therapist. Childhood should be fun, not scary. You don't want your child to gain an anxiety disorder along with their new skills.\n3. Make time for your child's siblings, if there are any. At times, they may feel left out, especially if you're busy taking care of your disabled child's needs. Try to spend quality time with each of your children every day. If you don't spend time with a child on one day, try to make up for it during the weekend.\n4. Celebrate your child! Your child is different, and they have their own special combination of traits that make them who they are. Love them for who they are, and treasure the good moments. Some conditions, such as Williams syndrome, include positive aspects. Let go of the idea of the child you could have had, and focus on the real child you have right now. They need your love.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned parent or caregiver of a child recently diagnosed with a rare chromosome disorder.

{"conversations": ["How to physically flirt with a girl?", "Flirting builds attraction and tension, but it has to be done in the right way. Done in the wrong way, the girl you like might scurry off and never look back. Like all flirting, body language attraction is a fun process, but don\u2019t rush it. Slowly position yourself so that you can flirt with your crush with confidence, and most importantly, have fun with it.\n\n## Get her to warm up to you\n\n1. Get to know her. Think about what she likes and her interests. Ask her if you're not sure. Understanding her interests helps you find common ground so that you have a reason to see and talk to her, which brings you one step closer to physically flirting with her. As you get to know her, be kind and considerate or she might not let you get much closer. Go slow. If you walk up and put your arm around a girl without knowing her well or flirting first, she might get offended and think you\u2019re too forward. Flirting gradually over a period of time -- even if it is a short period of time -- is the best way to get a girl to go out with you.\n2. Compliment her. Compliments give you the ability to let her warm up to you so that you can get close to her physically. When you talk to her, give her a compliment that sounds genuine. Otherwise, she might think you\u2019re trying to \"game\" her. Girls like compliments as long as it doesn\u2019t sound like a pick-up line. Superficial compliments might make her shut down and not want to talk to you. Give compliments that are unique to her and be specific. For instance, compliment her cute ears, freckles or eyes. Remember that a lot of girls -- even the pretty ones -- are very insecure. When you try to compliment her, she might not take you seriously because she thinks you are joking. So, reassure her that you\u2019re not. Don\u2019t neg her or give her a backhanded compliment. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty for a brunette\u201d is not a compliment. Never make her the object of a joke, and if people say something rude -- even if they're teasing -- tell them to stop. Then, quickly glance at her. If her eyes get bigger or if she smiles slightly, then she is impressed and thankful.\n3. Make eye contact when you speak to her. It not only lets her know that you\u2019re listening, but it also gives her the feeling that she is worth your undivided attention. Eye contact creates tension and attraction. Try to hold her gaze for a while without breaking it -- even if there are distractions around. Ignore them. She will be impressed that you didn\u2019t let the chaos around you distract you from her. Then, she\u2019ll be more likely to open up to you.\n4. Mimic her body language. If she leans forward, you lean forward. If she steps to the side, you step to the side. Mimicking her body language is a subtle way of letting her know that you are into her. Even if she is consciously unaware of this, subconsciously she may start to pick up the signal. Watch her body language as well to see if she mimics you. Mimicry is a sign that she is warming up to you even if she is not quite ready for flirtatious touching just yet.\n5. Give her attention in a crowd. Sometimes girls can feel lost when they are standing in a large crowd or even if she is standing amongst friends -- especially if her friends are attractive. She might think that some of her friends get more attention than she does because they are prettier or more outgoing, which means it can be difficult for her to feel like she is being seen and heard. So, make her feel like she is standing out from the others by giving her more attention. When she speaks, pay special attention. Make a point to talk to her directly instead of speaking to others. When the group is making a decision about where to go or what to do, ask her what she thinks the group should do.\n6. Call her just to talk. Make sure that she knows that you really want to get to know her better. Calling her just to chat -- especially since texting is far more popular -- lets her know that you really are interested in getting to know her better. Chat about her interests or current events. Or, just give her a hello and a short chat to let her know you\u2019re thinking about her. You don\u2019t need to be some extreme version of yourself that doesn\u2019t really exist. Just be \u201cnormal.\"\n7. Bring her something. Nothing major. It can be something small like a snack item that you see her eating often. Make sure that you come off like an observant person and not a creepy stalker who likes to watch her. Don't be put off if she refuses your gift. She may not want to immediately accept something from you. She doesn\u2019t want to feel as if she is indebted to you because you gave her something. If you ask a couple of times, she may eventually give in and accept it.\n8. Text her to ask you to meet you somewhere. If she agrees to meet you, don't comment on any other girls or talk about subjects that would make her think you aren't interested-- unless you know she likes those subjects. You don\u2019t want her to think you only like her as a friend. You want to make her feel special, not like just another member of your group\n\n\n## Sneak to touch her\n\n1. Touch her knee against yours. Slowly move your knee toward hers until they touch lightly. Make sure that you touch her knee gently and then linger, so she doesn't think that you are bumping her leg because you need more room for your legs. Flirting by accidental touch helps build attraction because it creates tension. Small touches here and there leaves her wanting more. But remember to keep your eyes open for mutual signals. If it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s enjoying it, stop.\n2. Touch her hand or arm when you laugh. Say something funny, or laugh at her jokes and then laugh. While you\u2019re laughing, gently touch the top of her hand or forearm as if to say \u201c you jokester.\u201d This should look casual and natural. It should look as is if you do this to everyone when you laugh. If you are sitting down when this happens, take this opportunity to casually slide your chair closer to hers.\n3. Tuck her hair behind her ear. This works best if she has a strand of hair out of place or a strand hanging in her face. Gently, tuck the hair behind her ear so that it is out of her face.\n4. Put your hand close to hers. When you are sitting next to her at a table, always place your hand so that it is really close to hers. A finger length apart or a little more is a good distance. To take it a step further, place your hands on hers for just a second as if it is accidental.\n5. Play footsie. If you're sitting at a table/desk across from her, gently put your feet on top of hers. It may seem like playing footsie is a little childish, but it is a way to get a girl\u2019s attention in a playful manner while also letting her know that you\u2019re interested. If she looks under the table and smiles, then she is happy that the person gently kicking her is you.\n\n\n## Flirt with her overtly\n\n1. Hug her. It\u2019s a reason to touch her in a non-sexual way. It\u2019s also a legitimate reason to touch her without seeming too flirty especially if you greet her with a hug. If you do this every time you see her, she will begin to understand that hugging is the way that you greet her.You could possibly get a hug every time you see her. If you want to take it a step further, hug her more frequently. Give her hugs for no reason if you know her fairly well. With time, this may escalate and she might start giving you hugs. However, also keep in mind that some people just don't like hugging. So, it is important to pay attention to her body language and facial expressions. If she doesn't like it, stop; and of course, if she tells you to stop, you should stop immediately.\n2. Play with her hair. Some girls like this. Focus on the hair at the nape of the neck because playing with her hair in this area will probably give her chills -- in a good way. If she is comfortable with you, play with the hair close to her torso or bustline. (Be respectful though.) From there if the girl is still comfortable, take it a little further. With the back of your hand, gently push the hair hanging in front of her shoulders behind her shoulders. (Please don't do this if it looks like the girl worked a long time to style her hair. Even if you are just trying to flirt with her, she will get mad at you for ruining her hair.) If all is well, start to rub her neck like you\u2019re giving her a neck massage.\n3. Put your hands around her waist from behind. If she likes you, she'll most likely lean back on you. Touch her gently so you don't startle her. If you two get really comfortable she might even let you slide your hand down a little lower. Once she\u2019s comfortable with you putting your hands on her waist, grab her and swing her around. Then, she\u2019ll be facing you. Lean in and whisper something in her ear, or just say it outright. You\u2019ll be able to tell if she liked it by the expression on her face. (Beware: Some girls are extremely ticklish and tend to involuntarily squeal or giggle when someone touches their waists).\n4. Push her playfully. When you're walking next to her on a sidewalk or path, gently push her off the path. She'll probably push you back, which will start some playful flirting. Because even childishly pushing each other is a way of flirting. (Don't do this on a busy road though. Someone might get hurt.)\n5. Put your head in her lap. If you're already friends and you're watching a movie, reading, or just talking with friends, go over and lie your head in her lap. Let her play with your hair. If she pushes you off, just laugh. This only works well if you\u2019ve flirted with this girl many times before.\n6. Tickle her. Good areas for tickling are under her ribs or the sides or her stomach. If she likes you, she'll tickle you back -- probably while smiling or laughing. Watch her signals though, if she doesn't like it or if she pulls away, stop. You don\u2019t want to annoy her and ruin any chances of getting close to her again. If she pulls away, revert back to the physical touching that she seems to be comfortable with and do that for a while.\n7. Be respectful. Pay attention to her body language and anything that she says. You don't want to overstep her boundaries. Overt touching should be consensual, and some people are uncomfortable with public displays of affection or being touched at all. Everyone is different, so it is very important to pay attention to her verbal and non-verbal cues. If she says, \"stop\" at any point, then stop. If she looks uncomfortable, stop. She'll perceive you as invading her space and possibly harassing her. Neither are attractive or respectful.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A young adult, possibly male, who is interested in dating and seeking advice on how to approach and flirt with women in a physical manner.

In addition to the main conference sessions, the conference will also include Expo, Tutorials, and Workshops. Please submit proposals to the appropriate chairs.\n\nWe invite submissions of papers on all topics related to machine learning for the main conference proceedings. All papers will be reviewed in a double-blind process and accepted papers will be presented at the conference. As with last year, papers need to be prepared and submitted as a single file: 8 pages as main paper, with unlimited pages for references and appendix. There will be no separate deadline for the submission of supplementary material. In addition, we require that, barring exceptional circumstances (such as visa problems) upon the acceptance of their papers, at least one of the authors must attend the conference, in person.\n\nTopics of interest include (but are not limited to):\n\n* General Machine Learning (active learning, clustering, online learning, ranking, reinforcement learning, supervised, semi- and self-supervised learning, time series analysis, etc.)\n* Deep Learning (architectures, generative models, deep reinforcement learning, etc.)\n* Learning Theory (bandits, game theory, statistical learning theory, etc.)\n* Optimization (convex and non-convex optimization, matrix/tensor methods, stochastic, online, non-smooth, composite, etc.)\n* Probabilistic Inference (Bayesian methods, graphical models, Monte Carlo methods, etc.)\n* Trustworthy Machine Learning (accountability, causality, fairness, privacy, robustness, etc.)\n* Applications (computational biology, crowdsourcing, healthcare, neuroscience, social good, climate science, etc.)\n\nImportant Dates:\n\nSubmission deadline: [Date and Time].\nNotification of acceptance: [Date and Time].\nConference dates: [Date and Time].\n\nSubmission Guidelines:\n\nDouble-Blind Review:\nAll submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information with the intention or consequence of violating the double-blind reviewing policy, including (but not limited to) citing previous works of the authors or sharing links in a way that can infer any author\u2019s identity or institution, actions that reveal the identities of the authors to potential reviewers.\n\nAuthors are allowed to post versions of their work on preprint servers such as arXiv. They are also allowed to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to ICML during the review. If you have posted or plan to post a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the ICML decisions are made, the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version.\n\nICML strongly discourages advertising the preprint on social media or in the press while under submission to ICML. Under no circumstances should your work be explicitly identified as ICML submission at any time during the review period, i.e., from the time you submit the paper to the communication of the accept/reject decisions.\n\nDual Submission:\nIt is not appropriate to submit papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Such submissions violate our dual submission policy, and the organizers have the right to reject such submissions, or to remove them from the proceedings. Note that submissions that have been or are being presented at workshops do not violate the dual-submission policy, as long as there\u2019s no associated archival publication.\n\nReviewing Criteria:\nAccepted papers must be based on original research and must contain novel results of significant interest to the machine learning community. Results can be either theoretical or empirical. Results will be judged on the degree to which they have been objectively established and/or their potential for scientific and technological impact. Reproducibility of results and easy availability of code will be taken into account in the decision-making process whenever appropriate."], "source": "authors", "questioner": "an academic researcher or conference organizer with a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence.

{"conversations": ["How to handle a dramatic sister in law?", "## Tone down the drama queen\n\n1. Realize that you may be dealing with a drama queen. The dynamics of a sister-in-law (S-I-L) are complex at the best of times but no more so if she has spent much of her life causing her immediate family to run to her beck and call. The drama queen thrives off drama and having everyone pay attention to her as a result. Sit back at your next family occasion and simply watch. Notice how she interacts with her family members, and how they in turn react back. If you witness a lot of step-toeing around her and acquiescing to her, she is clearly used to getting her own way. Consider what happens when she raises a drama-filled topic. Do other family members rush to agree with her about how \"outrageous\" the price of child care/electricity/shampoo/dog grooming/car maintenance/etc. is? Do they confirm her quibbles as quickly as possible, thereby engendering even more complaints? This shows that they enable her complaint-filled view of the world and sadly, have long been used to pandering to it. You can't change them but you can set a new role model by not complaining yourself. Notice what happens when you disagree with her. Does she pout, throw an adult-style tantrum or try and put you down? While it's important to stand your ground on things that matter to you, if she does react childishly, you'll need to learn how to manage this carefully. Learn not so much to disagree as to fail to agree\u2013\u2013there is a fine line but it's about acknowledging her underlying need (notice me, care about me, help me, etc.) without buying into her view of the world.\n2. Do not get involved with the drama. Your S-I-L can let off steam, vent away and curse all she wants but there is no need to join the negativity. Avoid taking any of what is said personally\u2013\u2013the crazier the reactions and actions, the more your S-I-L is grasping at straws to try and provoke you and restore the limelight back onto her. Let her have the limelight in her own home but don't hang around to be vented upon. If it gets really bad, simply announce that you will come back when she is feeling calmer and leave. Equally, if it's happening in your own home, tell it's time to leave. (You can even make up a fake appointment or an early bedtime if you really need a polite excuse.)\n\n\n## Deal with your hot button\n\n1. Look to yourself first. It can be hard when to do this when someone else pushes your buttons. But it is important because it is your reaction that defines whether or not she feels she can keep going in the same direction with you. Some of the things to consider include:\n\t* Stay silent and there's a risk she just thinks you're dumb, awed by her or chewed up with resentment. Take your pick, she's probably happy to think you're feeling all three. And she'll use your silence to keep putting across her point of view at the expense of yours. If you're grinning and bearing it, you're likely turning into a doormat. Argue and she probably thinks her brother/sister has married an angry, resentful and bitter so-and-so who hates her and will do anything to come between her and her brother/sister. You may feel as if you're defending yourself but to her, it's about you not caring what she thinks and possibly even about putting her down. This doesn't mean there isn't room for disagreement; it just means that the manner in which you realign her understanding must be done with care.\n2. Create boundaries. State the facts about matters that she pressures you about, firmly but politely, and avoid being emotional into the bargain. If you state things simply, stick to the facts and avoid making it into an issue about her, she has few places to run. Be aware that she may continue to resent you for speaking your mind in an assertive and self-effective way but this shouldn't stop you from clarifying your position. Ultimately, she has to respect someone who doesn't argue, lose their temper or bite their tongue but instead makes it absolutely clear where the boundaries exist. And even if she doesn't everyone else will plainly see that you are the cooler head in the room. For example, let's say your daughter Sheila has been running outside and has fallen over. Your S-I-L insists that she needs to see a doctor or something terrible might happen. You are quite sure nothing of the sort will occur and you know you're a good parent but S-I-L keeps badgering you, upping the intensity of all the bad things that will happen if you fail to follow her advice. Offer your S-I-L a calmly spoken \"That's very kind of you to notice that Sheila has a bruised knee but I am thoroughly satisfied that Sheila is going to be all right; this happens all the time and is a part of the way she learns to cope with the great outdoors. She does not need to see the doctor.\" And that's the end of it, no need to enter into any further discussion. If S-I-L keeps trying, smile and change the subject; refuse to re-engage on the matter.\n\n\n## You and your spouse\n\n1. Talk to your spouse about your feelings. Avoid name-calling, insulting or insinuating anything about your sister-in-law. Instead, explain how you feel when the proverbial dung hits the fan whenever you're in her presence. Your spouse cannot fault your feelings, so be clear and thoughtful in stating them. This puts your spouse on notice that you've recognized the behavior of your S-I-L for what it is and that you have chosen to no longer accept being at the receiving end of it. For example, \"Georgia, when your sister talks a lot about how hard it is to fund her children's private schooling, I feel claustrophobic because she doesn't know when to stop discussing it. Given that we can barely afford our mortgage, I feel a little distressed at this kind of talk all night. I'd like to stop putting myself in this position from now on by simply acknowledging her problem but not letting her continue discussing it all night and I'd like you to help me do this by finding other subjects to talk about that don't involve money. Do you think that this is something you can get on board with? \".\n2. Ask your spouse to think carefully about the way in which he or she relays information about family issues. Tell your spouse that you love to hear about how your sister-in-law is doing but that you don't appreciate hearing about the embellished drama that often comes with it. Help your spouse to recognize what you consider to be \"drama\" from what you consider to be \"real news\" and in time, both of you will learn to speak about family matters in a less dramatic and more emotionally healthy way. Remind your spouse gently whenever you feel that your S-I-L's drama is being repeated in your house. You could even have a special signal rather than having to spell it out each time. Place a ban on gossip at home (or anywhere). Remind one another whenever it veers anywhere near close to gossip and shut it down. It doesn't matter if you feel you are being gossiped about; you're the bigger person for not engaging in the same behavior.\n\n\n## Cop with your s-i-l's call and message\n\n1. Avoid answering what isn't worthy of a response. Don't respond to any text messages that do not directly relate to a family get-together, positive messages or something else perfectly normal. If you are getting texts that spell out her outrage about things that have happened to her, her annoyance at something you've apparently done or to send you gossip about family or friends, let it slide and leave her wondering. If you feel angry and want to send back a retort, reprimand or justification straight away, don't do it. Treat your anger or irritation as a warning sign to sleep on the matter. Furious texting or messaging can only end in more angst on both sides.\n2. Keep social media networking to a minimum with your sister-in-law if she sets off your buttons. If your S-I-L is truly a pain and a bit of a drama queen, it's possible that her social networking reflects her attention-seeking ways. You can be all too easily drawn into a web of her anger and drama venting if you can see her Facebook updates or her latest tweets. If she friends you, you can do one of several things. One, simply ignore the request. When she asks you about it, tell her that you don't use social media much to exchange important things (or at all); or\n\t* Two, reply to her with a \"Thanks but no thanks, I am not accepting new requests at the moment due to busyness/privacy/overloading, etc.\" You might also add something like, \"Besides, we see each other often and I prefer we talk face-to-face\"; or\n\t* Three, turn all of your settings to private so that she can't see who you are friends with. Either say nothing or tell her either that you stopped using social media or that you only have a tight knit circle of followers and don't wish to extend it at the moment. If you say you didn't receive any request, she'll only resend it, but it might buy enough time to throw her off the whole idea if you offer to \"look into it\" but let the \"looking into it\" drag on and refuse to raise the matter again); or\n\t* Four, offer her a more neutral alternative. Offer to friend her on Pinterest and focus solely on a shared craft or cooking board. Nothing racy or mean spirited, of course. Try to avoid using the terminology of \"friends\" when discussing any refusal to accept her request. Unfortunately, the usage of this term by social media sites has caused many people to take it at face value; many people are simply followers or fans, not friends. She might feel devalued if you make any suggestion that she is being rejected as a \"friend\". If she is already a follower of one or more of your networking sites, you might consider blocking her and turning your pages private on some sites. Most probably you will need to explain what has happened (with a sound excuse); if she's a drama queen, she'll not only notice but she'll take offense too.\n3. Take care if you do soldier on and try to be her friend online and/or through the phone. If she acts abusively, it is recommended that you keep records to show your spouse and other family members if needed. Save messages, emails, voice-mails, etc. Some drama queens like to \"attack\" when nobody else can see, thinking you won't have the courage to out them. This isn't about deliberately looking for dirt but it is a way of protecting yourself if anything should get out of hand. However, this is truly the stuff of last resort\u2013\u2013if you handle yourself deftly in public situations around your S-I-L, everyone will know for real who is behaving and who is stirring the pot.\n\n\n## A kinder future together\n\n1. Get on with your lives together. You married your spouse, not your family. While his or her family members are part of the package, they are not a part of your intimacy and they do not share the same journey with the two of you. If you make it very obvious that you're not bothered by jealousy, insinuations, rumors or gossip, it will soon become clear to your S-I-L that her barbs, attitude and meanness aren't pricking you in the way that they used to. Eventually, it ceases to be profitable or enjoyable for her to keep bothering and most likely she'll begrudgingly go and find someone else to taunt and hassle. Spend less time around your S-I-L. In what ways are you putting yourself in her pathway? While it may feel like you have to put up with her, you can find ways to reduce the time spent together. For example, ask other family members to meet you at different times than when she is around, more often than not. Don't always do this, or she will have a legitimate cause for complaining, but time spent with other family members shouldn't always involve her presence. If you live far away and have to visit once a year, stay in your own accommodation to give yourself respite. Take walks, get outside and don't overstay any welcome when it comes to drawn-out family events that press your buttons. Families know the pressure points better than anyone and unfortunately, some like to press them. At such events, your S-I-L probably has alliances that she can set in train to be even more effective, so the less time spent near such complaint-prone cliques, the better.\n2. Listen for real. When you are around your S-I-L, try active listening and acknowledgment in place of letting your fog of self-defensiveness take control. When she gets on top of her complaining mountain, instead of trying to topple her off with \"if you think that's bad, you should live in my shoes\" replies, actually focus on her and try to discern what is really driving her jibes, whining and gossip. By not making this about you, you may be truly surprised at what you unearth.As for responding to her, acknowledge her pain with neutral comments like: \"I'm sorry you have had to go through that to pay an electricity bill. It must be hard having four kids chewing through the power each month.\" Don't offer advice, don't offer how you would deal with it and don't ever offer to pay or pave the way to see her problem resolved. She owns it, you simply acknowledge it.\n3. Be compassionate. If your S-I-L has been a pain more than once and has even done things to show you up or drag you down, the chances are that she will try to do it again, even when you don't bite. But if you're ready for it and if you're understanding as to where she is coming from (insecurity, loneliness, feeling left out, needing to be in control, etc. ), you can be compassionate about her actions and detach yourself from her drama. If you don't carry her load, she'll be forced to do it for herself and will stop seeing you as a viable target.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned family member or friend seeking advice on managing a difficult relationship with a sibling's spouse.

There's a satellite-to-receiver transmission, nothing going in the opposite direction. So your cell phone doesn't have to find the radio power to send a signal all the way to space!\n(exceptions: The decommissioned Chinese BeiDou-1 system - and any products where the GPS receiver chip is used alongside a satellite transmitter, like a Cospas-Sarsat emergency locator beacon)\nThe signal from GPS satellites is very faint - each satellite has to broadcast a signal to about half the planet, powered only by some solar panels! So the broadcast signal is modulated using a 'Gold Code' (in the case of the oldest public GPS signal) where part of the signal transmitted by the satellite is already known by the receiver - the GPS receiver can pick out the signal despite how faint it is, by tracking the cross-correlation between the received and expected signals.\nThis also means multiple satellites can transmit their signals at the same frequency - so long as they use different gold codes, the receiver can track both signals independently.\nNewer GNSS signals replace gold codes with newer techniques - like 'multiplexed binary offset carriers' - which perform better, but do basically the same thing."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "an electronics engineer or a technology enthusiast with a strong interest in satellite communication and global positioning systems.

{"conversations": ["How to cook corn?", "There are many different yet simple ways to cook corn. Corn on the cob can be boiled, microwaved, grilled, steamed, or baked, while loose kernel corn is usually boiled, steamed, or microwaved. Keep reading to learn more about your preferred cooking method.\n\n## Boiling corn on the cob[1]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Boil a large stockpot of water. Meanwhile, prepare the corn cobs by removing the husks and silks. The exact amount of water you need will vary depending on how large each ear of corn is. Make sure that you use enough water to completely cover the ears of corn once they are submerged. Note that you can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) salt to the water if desired, but it is not needed. To remove the husks, snap off the stem of the corn with your hands. Pull the stem over the length of the corn to peel off the husks still attached to it. Remove the remaining husks by peeling them off with your fingers. Rinse the husk-free corn cobs under running water. Rub your hands over the corn to loose and free as many of the silky threads you spot clinging to the corn.\n2. Transfer the corn to the boiling water. Cover the pot and let it return to boiling. Use tongs to dunk the corn into the water. Avoid using your hands to transfer the corn since doing so may result in burns. If the boiling slows or stops after you place the corn in the stockpot, allow the water to reach a boiling point again before timing the cooking process.\n3. Cook for 3 to 8 minutes. The corn should be \"tender-crisp\" when done. \"Tender-crisp\" means that the corn is soft enough to press, but not mushy. The precise amount of cooking time will vary based on the type of corn and how mature it is. Fresh corn and sweet corn usually cook fastest.\n4. Remove and serve. Transfer the ears of corn to a layer of clean paper towels and let drain for 30 to 60 seconds before serving. The corn will be hot, so you may want to wait a few minutes before biting into it. Corn is usually served with a drizzle of butter.\n\n\n## Microwaving corn on the cob[2]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Place an ear of corn in a microwave-safe dish. You will need to cook the corn one ear at a time, but the instructions are the same for each ear. Do not remove the husk. The corn will cook better in the microwave if left in the husk during the cooking process.\n2. Microwave the corn for 5 minutes. The microwave should be set on high power or full power. Let stand in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes to avoid burning yourself with the steam.\n3. Transfer the corn to a cutting board. Cut of the stem end using a sharp kitchen knife. Use oven mitts or a towel when removing the corn from the microwave. As you cut, you should also remove the first row of kernels. Make sure to cut through the husk completely.\n4. Slip the corn out of its husk and serve. Use oven mitts or a towel to grab hold of the corn from the uncut top end. Gently shake the ear, allowing the corn to slip free. The ear of corn should slip out of the husk easily. Usually, even the silks will remain left behind inside the husks. You can serve the corn with butter and salt, or however you prefer it.\n\n\n## Grilling corn on the cob\n\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Meanwhile, remove the husks and silks from your ears of corn. If using a gas grill, set all the burners to medium-high heat and allow the grill to preheat for 5 to 10 minutes. If using a charcoal grill, allow a thick layer of coals to burn until white ash begins to form over the surface. Husk the corn by snapping off the stem and pulling it over the length of the corn, thereby removing the husk attached to the stem. Peel away the rest of the husk with your fingers. Rinse the ears under running water to remove most of the loose silks.\n2. Brush the corn with olive oil. Use a basting brush to apply a thin coat of olive oil to the surface of each ear of corn. Use no more than 1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil per ear. You could also use melted butter instead of olive oil.\n3. Transfer the corn to the grill. Cook for 6 to 10 minutes. Turn the corn occasionally to ensure even cooking and prevent burning. The corn is done once the majority of the kernels begin to brown lightly. It will also be charred in some spots, especially near the smaller kernels.\n4. Serve as desired. Remove the corn from the grill and transfer each ear to a serving platter. Let cool until you can handle it comfortably with your bare hands. Butter and salt are frequently served with corn, but if you used butter on the corn before grilling it, you may find that you do not need to add more.\n\n\n## Steaming corn on the cob[3]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Boil water in the bottom portion of a steamer. Husk and de-silk the ears of corn as you wait. If you do not have an actual steamer, you can use a large stockpot and perforated metal colander instead. Make sure that the metal colander can rest on the lip of the stockpot before attempting to use it, however. The basket portion of the colander should not dip below the halfway point of the stockpot. Snap off the stem of the corn and pull it over the length of the ear, removing the attached husk. Peel the rest of the husk away with your fingers. Rinse the corn under cool running water, scrubbing it gently with your hands. This should remove the majority of the silks.\n2. Transfer the corn to the steaming basket. Cook for 8 to 12 minutes. Use tongs to transfer the corn into the steaming basket. Using your hands could result in burns. The exact cooking time will vary depending on how mature the corn is. Fresher corn cooks quicker than older corn. The corn is done once the kernels feel tender but not mushy.\n3. Serve warm. Remove the corn from the steamer with your tongs and let rest for a minute or two before enjoying. Season with butter and salt, if desired.\n\n\n## Baking corn on the cob[4]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius). Remove the husks and silks from each ear of corn as the oven preheats. To remove the husk from an ear of corn, snap off the stem using your hands. Pull the broken stem down over the ear, stripping away any husk attached to it. Peel the rest of the exposed husk away with your fingers. Rinse each corn cob under running water, scrubbing gently with your hands to remove any visible silks. Pat dry with paper towels.\n2. Season the ears with butter. You can also add a little salt and pepper, if desired. Use plenty of butter. Spread at least 1 to 2 Tbsp of melted butter over each ear.\n3. Wrap each ear in aluminum foil. Each ear must be completely wrapped inside its own sheet of aluminum foil. If you are worried about butter leaking out from the aluminum foil, place a flat baking sheet or jelly-roll pan beneath the wrapped ears of corn to catch any dripping butter.\n4. Bake the corn for 20 to 30 minutes. Most ears of corn will only take 20 minutes to cook, but larger ears may need as many as 30 minutes. Place the corn on the middle rack of your oven to ensure the most even cooking.\n5. Remove and serve. Let the cooked ears of corn rest for 2 to 5 minutes before carefully removing the aluminum foil. Serve once they are cool enough to touch.\n\n\n## Boiling corn kernels\n\n1. Boil water in a medium saucepan. Meanwhile, measure out your frozen whole corn kernels. You can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) of salt to the boiling water, if desired, but the salt is not necessary. The corn does not need to be thawed prior to use. You could also use canned corn kernels instead of frozen corn. Note that the amount of time needed to boil canned corn is significantly less than the amount of time needed to boil frozen corn. Additionally, canned corn should be drained before you add it to the boiling water.\n2. Add the corn to the boiling water. If the boiling decreases or stops, let the water come up to a boil again. After it returns to a rolling boil, reduce the heat to medium-low.\n3. Cover and cook. Frozen whole kernels of corn should simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain once finished. Canned corn should only boil for 1 to 3 minutes. Once finished, the corn should be hot and tender but not mushy.\n4. Serve as desired. Do not refreeze corn kernels after cooking them. If desired, you can mix the cooked corn kernels with butter, salt, and black pepper. You can also use other seasonings, like parsley, according to your own tastes.\n\n\n## Steaming corn kernels\n\n1. Simmer water in a steamer. Fill the lower part of a steamer with water and heat, on the stove, over medium heat until the water steams and starts to simmer. Do not boil the water. Do not fill the steamer high enough for water to slip up through the holes of the steamer basket. If you do not have a steamer, you could use a stockpot and a metal colander with fine holes. Make sure that the colander fits over the lip of the stockpot without falling in.\n2. Add frozen corn kernels into the steamer basket. Spread the kernels out into a single layer. Canned corn kernels can also be used, but they will finish cooking in a much shorter amount of time. They may also be soggier once finished. You do not need to thaw frozen corn kernels before use.\n3. Cook for 9 to 10 minutes. Allow the corn to steam for 9 to 10 minutes without covering it. Drain once finished. Canned kernels will only need to steam for 3 or 4 minutes.\n4. Serve. Steamed corn can be served with butter and salt as well as other seasonings.\n\n\n## Microwaving corn kernels\n\n1. Place corn kernels in a microwave-safe dish. Spread frozen corn kernels into an even layer in the dish. Canned corn kernels can also be used, but there are some differences in the cooking method and length. Frozen corn does not need to be thawed prior to cooking.\n2. Add 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 mL) of water. Stir the water into the corn to disperse it throughout. Note that this step is only needed if using frozen corn kernels. You do not need to add water if using canned corn, but you should not drain the canned corn before use.\n3. Cover the dish with plastic wrap. Use a fork to poke a few holes into the plastic wrap, providing ventilation. Only use plastic wrap that is safe to use in the microwave. If the dish has a cover, you could use that instead of the plastic wrap. Make sure that the cover is placed on the dish loosely so that the corn is still ventilated.\n4. Microwave for 4 to 5 minutes. If using canned corn, only microwave the dish for 1 to 2 minutes. The exact length of time varies depending on how much wattage your microwave has. A lower-powered microwave will need longer time, while a higher-powered microwave will need less time. If you hear popping sounds as the corn cooks, stop the microwave early.\n5. Drain and serve. Drain the cooking liquid from the corn and season as desired with butter, salt, and pepper.\n\n\n## Charcoal grilled corn on the cob\n\n1. Cut the tip of each ear of corn off. Soak the corn in the husks in a sink or a big pot in 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) of tap water for about an hour.\n2. While they're soaking, prepare your outdoor charcoal grill. Add enough coals for an hour of cooking.\n3. Place the corn still in the husks on the grill. Cook for about an hour, turning occasionally, allowing the husks to char.\n4. Remove the husks.\n5. Add butter, salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A curious home cook or a beginner in the kitchen who is seeking guidance on preparing corn dishes.

However, you don't get a torque from spinning a reaction wheel at constant angular velocity but by changing and accelerating that angular velocity.\n\nNow the torque imparted on the helicopter by the air through the main rotor is steady - or at least its of roughly constant direction.

{"conversations": ["I don't really get the difference between gain and volume boost.\n\nSo if I understand correctly, gain directly boosts a signal from a line or input while volume handles the output. Volume isn't really for boosting either.\nWould this mean, in most settings, getting 'close to' as much gain as possible without any hiss/background noise is ideal?", "Here's a brief overview to get you started. Hopefully this helps!\n\n* 'Gain' controls are typically used to get a good input level. So for example if you had a microphone with a very low output signal, you would boost the gain to get a better level into your mixing desk or audio interface. If you had a synthesizer plugged in you might need to turn the gain down to stop the signal distorting. Gain controls are often controlling an amplifier behind the scenes - i.e. your signal can 'gain' strength after going through the gain stage of your audio equipment. So gain is usually the first control in the signal path of your recording equipment. \n\n* 'Volume' controls on the other hand tend to be at the end of the signal chain and are more likely to be attenuating rather than amplifying the signal. So on a mixing desk, having got a good level from each input at the gain stage, you use the volume faders to adjust the relative volumes of each channel to achieve a good mix. You are not typically amplifying those signals any more though.\n\nA guitar amp is a good example of how this works. The first control is often called \"Gain\" or 'drive' and guitarists often deliberately turn this really high to get a nice distorted sound from a tube preamp. However, the final control is called Volume and governs simply how loud the sound coming out of your speaker is. With gain right up and volume low you can play distorted sounds without annoying the neighbours. With gain low and volume high you get a loud sound but no distortion."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "an audio engineer, music producer, or audio technology student who is looking to deepen their understanding of audio signal processing.

{"conversations": ["How to treat ocd and anxiety as a workaholic?", "Working too much is a serious problem. Often, people who work too much also suffer from OCD or related anxiety disorders. If you work too much and suffer from an anxiety disorder, there are several things you can do to lead a more balanced life. You can start by seeing your doctor and going to therapy. Lifestyle changes, such as adopting stress-relieving techniques, making work boundaries, and managing your anxiety or OCD, are also important.\n\n## Manage your anxiety disorder\n\n1. Make a self-care plan. To improve your relationship with work and alleviate anxiety or OCD symptoms, you can develop a self-care plan that covers every area of your life. If you are obsessed with working, the rest of your life may be neglected. A self-care plan helps you balance your life and pay attention to each part of your life. Your self-care plan can focus on work, relationships, leisure time, the self, and your spiritual life. By breaking down your life into concrete categories, you can see where you are lacking and what needs improvement. For example, you may have 90% of your energy into your work. Your self-care plan allows you to schedule an hour each evening for leisure, where you watch television, an hour of exercise to focus on yourself, and two hours to spend with your family. On the weekends, you spend Saturday with your family and friends, and Sunday you focus on yourself. Start working on balancing your life. All of your energy now is focused on work. You should think about what\u2019s important to you, like family and friend relationships or improving your leisure time. Put more effort into those areas of your life and less into work. Becoming more balanced in your life, improving relationships, and working on yourself can help reduce stress that leads to anxiety and OCD.\n2. Get enough sleep. Many people who work all of the time don\u2019t sleep enough because they are too busy working. This can worsen anxiety and OCD symptoms, making you feel even worse. Worsening anxiety and OCD symptoms may also affect your work quality. To help with this, strive to get into a healthy sleep routine. Most people need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. You should go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning. This helps you adopt healthy sleeping habits.\n3. Take stress-relief breaks during the day. If you are spending all of your time focusing on work, your stress levels may be extremely high. This can increase your anxiety or OCD symptoms. To help alleviate your anxiety, take small breaks from work throughout the day to relieve stress. For example, take a 10 minute walk around the building or block. Exercise can help boost your mood and improve your anxiety. Go to lunch with coworkers or friends. Spending time connecting with people can help reduce anxiety and OCD symptoms.\n4. Engage in stress-relief techniques. When your anxiety or OCD symptoms get too bad because you are not working, you may need to use stress-relieving techniques to alleviate the symptoms. At first, you may even experience anxiety attacks as you fight compulsions or obsessive thoughts about working. Try deep breathing to help relieve anxiety. Whenever you feel overwhelmed by anxiety or OCD symptoms when you aren\u2019t working, take a deep breath through your nose as you count to five. Hold it for a count of five, then exhale through your mouth for a count of five. Regular exercise is a great way to treat anxiety and OCD symptoms. A thirty minute walk each day can reduce your symptoms. Try getting active each day, or try stress-relieving exercises such as yoga or tai chi.\n5. Meditate. One good way to learn how to calm down and let go of work is to meditate. Meditation helps you learn how to clear your mind so you can reduce stress. Mediation is also a good treatment for anxiety and OCD. Mediation helps you get rid of negative thoughts, stress, guilt, and anxiety. Meditation may also help you be able to control compulsions and obsessive thoughts. Guided meditation is a good starting place if you\u2019ve never meditated before. Guided meditation walks you through the process, so you are coached to relaxation and towards your mental goals.\n6. Develop hobbies. When you work too much, you may begin to lose yourself and forget to focus on anything that is enjoyable or enriching in your life. To help work on your sense of self, revisit old hobbies or develop new interests that have nothing to do with work. At first, you may have to tell yourself that spending time not working is okay. Remind yourself, \u201cSpending time engaging in hobbies helps me be a healthier, happier person. I have completed my work and I deserve something good.\u201d\n\n\n## Seek medical treatment\n\n1. See your doctor for a diagnosis and to begin treatment. To get proper treatment for your anxiety disorder or OCD, you need to get a proper diagnosis for both conditions. Anxiety disorders and OCD are serious mental illnesses that should be treated by a doctor or a therapist. If you work too much and you also suffer from anxiety or OCD, then your symptoms may be even more pronounced. However, with proper treatment, you can alleviate your symptoms and live a healthier life. Your doctor may suggest medication to treat the anxiety and OCD symptoms. Psychotherapy is also a common treatment for anxiety disorders. Your doctor will probably refer you to a psychiatrist or therapist who can provide therapy to address your anxiety disorder, OCD, and addiction-like behaviors. To find a therapist, start by asking your doctor for a referral. You can also search online for therapists in your area who specialize in your disorder. When you search online, you can also read reviews and patient experiences with the therapist.\n2. Undergo cognitive behavioral therapy. One effective treatment for anxiety and OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on changing negative thought patterns into healthier ones. This can also help change your attitude about work, along with helping you cope with obsessive and anxious thoughts and compulsions. You may have unhealthy or untrue beliefs about work. A therapist can help you work through these beliefs and modify them into healthier, more productive beliefs. For example, if you believe you will lose your job if you don\u2019t work all the time, your therapist can use CBT to help you change that thought to something like, \u201cI can work hard for this many hours each week and keep my job.\u201d\n3. Go to family therapy. Family therapy may be needed if working too much and having anxiety has negatively affected your family relationships. During family relationships, a therapist can help you learn how to interact with your family and make them a priority in your life. Your therapist can also help you figure out activities that you and your family can do together. These activities can strengthen your relationship and help you alter your attention away from work and onto leisure activity and relationships. You and your family can use therapy to learn how to communicate with each other. You may also be able to be truthful about ways your behavior has hurt each other. For example, your partner may say, \"I feel hurt that we never take any vacations because you are always working.\" You might say, \"I am frustrated because you get angry when I check my work e-mail in the evenings.\"\n\n\n## Establish work-related boundaries\n\n1. Leave work at work. When you leave work, you should do just that - leave work behind. Try not to take work home with you. Focusing on work at home can increase your anxiety and OCD symptoms while feeding your need to work. Try to make a clear boundary between work time and time not at work. For example, you can decide not to check your email or answer your phone when you\u2019re at home. Leave all paperwork and projects at work. Don\u2019t bring them home with you. If you must answer emails or work on paperwork at night, set aside a designated half an hour or hour to do just that. This helps keep your work time separate from your home time. It also keeps you from doing work all night.\n2. Talk to your boss about work boundaries. If working too much is triggering your anxiety or OCD, then you may want to talk to your boss about setting boundaries. You should tell our boss that you need to make clear boundaries about when you work and when you won\u2019t work. This may include what you will and won\u2019t do when you\u2019re off the clock. If you are an hourly worker, you may tell your boss that you will only work during your required hours. If your boss wants you to work outside of those hours, you may negotiate overtime or say no. If you are salaried, you may set a limit on the amount of hours you will work and discuss this with your boss. You may want to say, \u201cI have been working too much and spreading myself too thin. I would like to set some boundaries in relation to the hours I work.\u201d\n3. Change your thoughts about work. If you have anxiety and OCD, you may be plagued by inaccurate thoughts or obsessions. You may believe if you don\u2019t work all the time you will lose your job. You may have the compulsion to work constantly and get edgy or irritated if you are unable to work. To help treat your anxiety and OCD symptoms, work on changing your thoughts about work. Start by telling yourself that being away from work doesn\u2019t make you lazy or unproductive. Repeat to yourself, \u201cI do not have to work every hour of every day. I can take time to focus on myself and relationships.\u201d\n\t* Face your obsessive or anxious thoughts. When you start to feel anxious because you aren\u2019t working, tell yourself, \u201cNothing bad will happen if I am not working. These are just my anxieties. I deserve to take a break from work.\u201d\n4. Prioritize your to-do list. Due to your anxiety, you may have a long to-do list with things you must get done. Maybe you have obsessive thoughts about what will happen if you don\u2019t complete everything, or you have the compulsion to keep working until you have completed everything on the list. This is not healthy and just feeds anxiety and stress. Instead, start prioritizing the things you have to do and limiting your to-do list. For example, honestly assess everything on your list. What are things that have to get done today? What things have to be done by the end of the week? What things have no time limit on them? You may have to finish paperwork for work by the end of the day, complete a project by the end of the week, but making fliers can be done when you get to them. Limit your tasks to around five per day. If you have to add something to your task list for that day, you need to remove one task. Keep yourself limited so you don\u2019t overextend yourself.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A person struggling with workaholism, OCD, and anxiety, seeking practical strategies and advice to manage these conditions and improve their work-life balance.

{"conversations": ["How to handle a dramatic sister in law?", "## Tone down the drama queen\n\n1. Realize that you may be dealing with a drama queen. The dynamics of a sister-in-law (S-I-L) are complex at the best of times but no more so if she has spent much of her life causing her immediate family to run to her beck and call. The drama queen thrives off drama and having everyone pay attention to her as a result. Sit back at your next family occasion and simply watch. Notice how she interacts with her family members, and how they in turn react back. If you witness a lot of step-toeing around her and acquiescing to her, she is clearly used to getting her own way. Consider what happens when she raises a drama-filled topic. Do other family members rush to agree with her about how \"outrageous\" the price of child care/electricity/shampoo/dog grooming/car maintenance/etc. is? Do they confirm her quibbles as quickly as possible, thereby engendering even more complaints? This shows that they enable her complaint-filled view of the world and sadly, have long been used to pandering to it. You can't change them but you can set a new role model by not complaining yourself. Notice what happens when you disagree with her. Does she pout, throw an adult-style tantrum or try and put you down? While it's important to stand your ground on things that matter to you, if she does react childishly, you'll need to learn how to manage this carefully. Learn not so much to disagree as to fail to agree\u2013\u2013there is a fine line but it's about acknowledging her underlying need (notice me, care about me, help me, etc.) without buying into her view of the world.\n2. Do not get involved with the drama. Your S-I-L can let off steam, vent away and curse all she wants but there is no need to join the negativity. Avoid taking any of what is said personally\u2013\u2013the crazier the reactions and actions, the more your S-I-L is grasping at straws to try and provoke you and restore the limelight back onto her. Let her have the limelight in her own home but don't hang around to be vented upon. If it gets really bad, simply announce that you will come back when she is feeling calmer and leave. Equally, if it's happening in your own home, tell it's time to leave. (You can even make up a fake appointment or an early bedtime if you really need a polite excuse.)\n\n\n## Deal with your hot button\n\n1. Look to yourself first. It can be hard when to do this when someone else pushes your buttons. But it is important because it is your reaction that defines whether or not she feels she can keep going in the same direction with you. Some of the things to consider include:\n\t* Stay silent and there's a risk she just thinks you're dumb, awed by her or chewed up with resentment. Take your pick, she's probably happy to think you're feeling all three. And she'll use your silence to keep putting across her point of view at the expense of yours. If you're grinning and bearing it, you're likely turning into a doormat. Argue and she probably thinks her brother/sister has married an angry, resentful and bitter so-and-so who hates her and will do anything to come between her and her brother/sister. You may feel as if you're defending yourself but to her, it's about you not caring what she thinks and possibly even about putting her down. This doesn't mean there isn't room for disagreement; it just means that the manner in which you realign her understanding must be done with care.\n2. Create boundaries. State the facts about matters that she pressures you about, firmly but politely, and avoid being emotional into the bargain. If you state things simply, stick to the facts and avoid making it into an issue about her, she has few places to run. Be aware that she may continue to resent you for speaking your mind in an assertive and self-effective way but this shouldn't stop you from clarifying your position. Ultimately, she has to respect someone who doesn't argue, lose their temper or bite their tongue but instead makes it absolutely clear where the boundaries exist. And even if she doesn't everyone else will plainly see that you are the cooler head in the room. For example, let's say your daughter Sheila has been running outside and has fallen over. Your S-I-L insists that she needs to see a doctor or something terrible might happen. You are quite sure nothing of the sort will occur and you know you're a good parent but S-I-L keeps badgering you, upping the intensity of all the bad things that will happen if you fail to follow her advice. Offer your S-I-L a calmly spoken \"That's very kind of you to notice that Sheila has a bruised knee but I am thoroughly satisfied that Sheila is going to be all right; this happens all the time and is a part of the way she learns to cope with the great outdoors. She does not need to see the doctor.\" And that's the end of it, no need to enter into any further discussion. If S-I-L keeps trying, smile and change the subject; refuse to re-engage on the matter.\n\n\n## You and your spouse\n\n1. Talk to your spouse about your feelings. Avoid name-calling, insulting or insinuating anything about your sister-in-law. Instead, explain how you feel when the proverbial dung hits the fan whenever you're in her presence. Your spouse cannot fault your feelings, so be clear and thoughtful in stating them. This puts your spouse on notice that you've recognized the behavior of your S-I-L for what it is and that you have chosen to no longer accept being at the receiving end of it. For example, \"Georgia, when your sister talks a lot about how hard it is to fund her children's private schooling, I feel claustrophobic because she doesn't know when to stop discussing it. Given that we can barely afford our mortgage, I feel a little distressed at this kind of talk all night. I'd like to stop putting myself in this position from now on by simply acknowledging her problem but not letting her continue discussing it all night and I'd like you to help me do this by finding other subjects to talk about that don't involve money. Do you think that this is something you can get on board with? \".\n2. Ask your spouse to think carefully about the way in which he or she relays information about family issues. Tell your spouse that you love to hear about how your sister-in-law is doing but that you don't appreciate hearing about the embellished drama that often comes with it. Help your spouse to recognize what you consider to be \"drama\" from what you consider to be \"real news\" and in time, both of you will learn to speak about family matters in a less dramatic and more emotionally healthy way. Remind your spouse gently whenever you feel that your S-I-L's drama is being repeated in your house. You could even have a special signal rather than having to spell it out each time. Place a ban on gossip at home (or anywhere). Remind one another whenever it veers anywhere near close to gossip and shut it down. It doesn't matter if you feel you are being gossiped about; you're the bigger person for not engaging in the same behavior.\n\n\n## Cop with your s-i-l's call and message\n\n1. Avoid answering what isn't worthy of a response. Don't respond to any text messages that do not directly relate to a family get-together, positive messages or something else perfectly normal. If you are getting texts that spell out her outrage about things that have happened to her, her annoyance at something you've apparently done or to send you gossip about family or friends, let it slide and leave her wondering. If you feel angry and want to send back a retort, reprimand or justification straight away, don't do it. Treat your anger or irritation as a warning sign to sleep on the matter. Furious texting or messaging can only end in more angst on both sides.\n2. Keep social media networking to a minimum with your sister-in-law if she sets off your buttons. If your S-I-L is truly a pain and a bit of a drama queen, it's possible that her social networking reflects her attention-seeking ways. You can be all too easily drawn into a web of her anger and drama venting if you can see her Facebook updates or her latest tweets. If she friends you, you can do one of several things. One, simply ignore the request. When she asks you about it, tell her that you don't use social media much to exchange important things (or at all); or\n\t* Two, reply to her with a \"Thanks but no thanks, I am not accepting new requests at the moment due to busyness/privacy/overloading, etc.\" You might also add something like, \"Besides, we see each other often and I prefer we talk face-to-face\"; or\n\t* Three, turn all of your settings to private so that she can't see who you are friends with. Either say nothing or tell her either that you stopped using social media or that you only have a tight knit circle of followers and don't wish to extend it at the moment. If you say you didn't receive any request, she'll only resend it, but it might buy enough time to throw her off the whole idea if you offer to \"look into it\" but let the \"looking into it\" drag on and refuse to raise the matter again); or\n\t* Four, offer her a more neutral alternative. Offer to friend her on Pinterest and focus solely on a shared craft or cooking board. Nothing racy or mean spirited, of course. Try to avoid using the terminology of \"friends\" when discussing any refusal to accept her request. Unfortunately, the usage of this term by social media sites has caused many people to take it at face value; many people are simply followers or fans, not friends. She might feel devalued if you make any suggestion that she is being rejected as a \"friend\". If she is already a follower of one or more of your networking sites, you might consider blocking her and turning your pages private on some sites. Most probably you will need to explain what has happened (with a sound excuse); if she's a drama queen, she'll not only notice but she'll take offense too.\n3. Take care if you do soldier on and try to be her friend online and/or through the phone. If she acts abusively, it is recommended that you keep records to show your spouse and other family members if needed. Save messages, emails, voice-mails, etc. Some drama queens like to \"attack\" when nobody else can see, thinking you won't have the courage to out them. This isn't about deliberately looking for dirt but it is a way of protecting yourself if anything should get out of hand. However, this is truly the stuff of last resort\u2013\u2013if you handle yourself deftly in public situations around your S-I-L, everyone will know for real who is behaving and who is stirring the pot.\n\n\n## A kinder future together\n\n1. Get on with your lives together. You married your spouse, not your family. While his or her family members are part of the package, they are not a part of your intimacy and they do not share the same journey with the two of you. If you make it very obvious that you're not bothered by jealousy, insinuations, rumors or gossip, it will soon become clear to your S-I-L that her barbs, attitude and meanness aren't pricking you in the way that they used to. Eventually, it ceases to be profitable or enjoyable for her to keep bothering and most likely she'll begrudgingly go and find someone else to taunt and hassle. Spend less time around your S-I-L. In what ways are you putting yourself in her pathway? While it may feel like you have to put up with her, you can find ways to reduce the time spent together. For example, ask other family members to meet you at different times than when she is around, more often than not. Don't always do this, or she will have a legitimate cause for complaining, but time spent with other family members shouldn't always involve her presence. If you live far away and have to visit once a year, stay in your own accommodation to give yourself respite. Take walks, get outside and don't overstay any welcome when it comes to drawn-out family events that press your buttons. Families know the pressure points better than anyone and unfortunately, some like to press them. At such events, your S-I-L probably has alliances that she can set in train to be even more effective, so the less time spent near such complaint-prone cliques, the better.\n2. Listen for real. When you are around your S-I-L, try active listening and acknowledgment in place of letting your fog of self-defensiveness take control. When she gets on top of her complaining mountain, instead of trying to topple her off with \"if you think that's bad, you should live in my shoes\" replies, actually focus on her and try to discern what is really driving her jibes, whining and gossip. By not making this about you, you may be truly surprised at what you unearth.As for responding to her, acknowledge her pain with neutral comments like: \"I'm sorry you have had to go through that to pay an electricity bill. It must be hard having four kids chewing through the power each month.\" Don't offer advice, don't offer how you would deal with it and don't ever offer to pay or pave the way to see her problem resolved. She owns it, you simply acknowledge it.\n3. Be compassionate. If your S-I-L has been a pain more than once and has even done things to show you up or drag you down, the chances are that she will try to do it again, even when you don't bite. But if you're ready for it and if you're understanding as to where she is coming from (insecurity, loneliness, feeling left out, needing to be in control, etc. ), you can be compassionate about her actions and detach yourself from her drama. If you don't carry her load, she'll be forced to do it for herself and will stop seeing you as a viable target.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned family member or friend seeking advice on managing a difficult relationship with a sibling's spouse.

{"conversations": ["How much does it cost to make a MOOC universally accessible, as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990?", "The cost of making a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) universally accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of content the MOOC contains ( video / text / etc.). Meeting the Section 508* requirements for Web pages used in such a course is effectively without cost if one starts out to make such pages accessible. Retrofitting might cost as much as the original project, but the cost should be near zero for modern MOOCs.\n\n* Captioning and Transcripts: Closed (or open) captions are very expensive. Unless done at a foreign sweatshop, cost is $5.00 to $15.00 per minute, so something like $12,000 as a minimum, up over $35,000, for a one-semester course. In other words, the captioning can cost more than the professor. That's at least part of why some institutions employ ASL interpreters for class sections with deaf students. The $5-15 number given above could be reduced by using student labor, especially if the students are majors in the material being subtitled. In addition, captioning through voice recognition is getting much better, but still requires certain amount of manual editing. \n\n* Audio Descriptions: Making course materials available to the blind means being sure that everything that is shown is also described, either by the speaker who is presenting or in a manner that can be rendered through text-to-speech. The latter means being sure that there are good \"alt\" descriptions of images and that appropriate markup, e.g. MathML, is used for things like equations. In disciplines like computing, that isn't onerous, and the costs may disappear in the weeds of getting the course done. Things might be very different in a discipline like the visual arts.\n\n* Screen Reader Compatibility: Ensuring that the MOOC is compatible with screen readers and assistive technologies can involve additional development and testing efforts. This cost may vary depending on the complexity of the course platform and its current level of accessibility.\n\nIt is recommended to consult with accessibility experts, organizations specializing in accessible design, or accessibility consultants who can provide more accurate estimates based on the specific requirements of your MOOC. They can conduct a comprehensive evaluation and provide cost estimates tailored to your project's needs.", "If captioning costs $5-$15 per minute, how does it become effectively free if you start out with it in mind?", "Sorry for causing any confusions.

If an individual author is listed for the web page you want to cite, type their last name first, followed by a comma, then their first name. Place a period at the end of the name. Example: Claymore, Crystal. If no individual author is listed, but the website is produced by a government agency, organization, or business, use that name as the author. For example, if you're using a CDC web page as a source, you would list the author as \"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Tip: For your entire Works Cited entry, if an element doesn't exist or isn't provided, simply skip that part of the citation and move on to the next part.\n2. Provide the title of the page in double quotation marks. If the specific web page has a title, type it after the author's name. Use title case, capitalizing the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adverbs, adjectives, and verbs. Enclose the title in double quotation marks, placing a period at the end of the title, inside the closing quotation marks. Example: Claymore, Crystal. \"Best-Kept Secrets for Amazing Cupcake Frosting.\"\n3. Give the name of the website in italics followed by the date of publication. Type the name of the website as a whole in title case, followed by a comma. Use the capitalization and spacing schemes the website uses if they are proprietary (such as \"wikiHow\" or \"WebMD\") If there is a publication date for the web page, list it in day-month-year format, abbreviating all months with names longer than 4 letters. Place a comma after the date of publication. Example: Claymore, Crystal. \"Best-Kept Secrets for Amazing Cupcake Frosting.\" Crystal's Cupcakes, 24 Sept. 2018,\n4. Include the URL for the web page. Copy the URL for the web page and paste it into your entry, leaving off the \"http://\" part. Place a period at the end of the URL. Make sure the URL you use is a permalink for the information you're citing. If the URL is excessively long, talk to your instructor or supervisor about using a shortened URL. Example: Claymore, Crystal. \"Best-Kept Secrets for Amazing Cupcake Frosting.\" Crystal's Cupcakes, 24 Sept. 2018, www.crystalscupcakes.com/amazing-frosting.\n5. Close with your date of access if there was no date of publication. Often, a web page won't have a particular publication date. If that happens for a page you want to cite, add the word \"Accessed\" after the URL and include the date you last accessed the page in day-month-year format. Abbreviate all months with names that have more than 4 letters. Place a period at the end of the date. Example: Claymore, Crystal. \"Best-Kept Secrets for Amazing Cupcake Frosting.\" Crystal's Cupcakes, www.crystalscupcakes.com/amazing-frosting. Accessed 14 Feb. 2019. MLA Works Cited Format:\n\t* Author Last Name, First Name. \"Title of Web Page in Title Case.\" Name of Website, Day Month Year of publication, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.\n6. Place a parenthetical citation after referencing the website in your text. An MLA parenthetical citation typically includes the author's last name and the page number where the quoted or paraphrased information can be found. Since websites don't have page numbers, simply include the author's last name in the parenthetical, or the title of the web page if there is no author. Place your parenthetical inside the closing punctuation for the sentence. For example, you might write: \"The best cupcake frosting techniques are often the least intuitive (Claymore).\" If you include the author's name in your text, there's no need for a parenthetical citation. For example, you might write: \"Award-winning baker Crystal Claymore wasn't afraid to give away all her secrets, sharing her favorite frosting techniques on her website.\"\n\n\n## Apa\n\n1. Start your reference list entry with the name of the author. If an individual author is listed, type their last name first, followed by a comma, then their first and middle initials (if a middle initial is given. Usually, the author of a website will be the government agency, organization, or business that owns the website. In that case, list the name of that entity followed by a period. Example: Canadian Cancer Society.\n2. Add the year the website or page was published. If a publication date is provided next to the content you are citing, include that year in parentheses after the name of the author. Place a period after the closing parentheses. If no date is provided for the specific content you're citing, use the abbreviation \"n.d.\" (for \"no date\") inside the parentheses. Do not use the copyright date for the website itself. Example: Canadian Cancer Society. (2017). If you're citing several pages from the same website that were published in the same year, add a lower-case letter to the end of the year so you can differentiate them in your in-text citations. For example, you might have \"2017a\" and \"2017b.\"\n3. Type the title of the web page in sentence case. Type a space after the period that follows the date, then type the title of the web page, which will usually appear as a header at the top of the page. Use sentence case, capitalizing only the first word and any proper nouns. Place a period at the end of the title. Example: Canadian Cancer Society. (2017). Cancer research. If the content you're citing is a stand-alone document, the title should be italicized. This will usually be the case if you're citing a PDF document that appears on a website. If you're not sure, use your best judgment in deciding whether to italicize it or not.\n4. Close with the direct URL of the web page. Copy the full direct URL or permalink of the content you want to cite. Type the words \"Retrieved from,\" then past the URL into your entry. Do not place a period at the end of the URL. If the URL is overly long, ask your instructor or supervisor if you can use a shortened link. Example: Canadian Cancer Society. (2017). Cancer research. Retrieved from http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-101/cancer-research/?region=on\n\t* APA Reference List Format:\n\t* Author Last Name, A. A. (Year). Title of web page in sentence case. Retrieved from URL\n5. Use the author's name and year for in-text parenthetical citations. APA uses author-year parenthetical at the end of any sentence in which you quote or paraphrase information from the website. The parenthetical citation goes inside the closing punctuation for the sentence. For example, you might write: \"Clinical trials are used to test new cancer treatments (Canadian Cancer Society, 2017).\" If you include the author's name in your text, place the year in parentheses immediately after the author's name. For example, you might write: \"The Canadian Cancer Society (2017) noted that Canada is a global leader in clinical trials of cancer treatments.\"\n\n\n## Chicago\n\n1. Start your bibliographic entry with the name of the author. If the web page has an individual author listed, type that author's last name first, followed by a comma, then their first name. If there is no individual author, use the name of the organization, company, or government agency that published the content as the author. Place a period at the end of the author's name. Example: UN Women.\n2. List the title of the web page in double quotation marks. After the name of the article, provide the title of the specific web page. Use title case, capitalizing the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs. Place a period at the end of the title, inside the closing quotation marks. Example: UN Women. \"Commission on the Status of Women.\"\n3. Add the name of the website or publishing organization in italics. If the website has a distinct name, include this after the title of the webpage. If it doesn't, use the name of the business, organization, or government agency that produces the website.

If the content you're citing has a specific publication date associated with it, provide that date in month-day-year format. If no publication date is listed, type the word \"Accessed\" followed by the date you accessed the content in month-day-year format. Spell out the names of all months. Example: UN Women. \"Commission on the Status of Women.\" UN Women. Accessed February 14, 2019.\n5. Close your entry with a direct URL to the web page. Copy the full URL for the permalink of the web page and paste it into your bibliographic entry. Place a period at the end of the URL. If the URL is overly lengthy, talk to your instructor, editor, or supervisor about using a shortened link. Example: UN Women. \"Commission on the Status of Women.\" UN Women.

If the patent owner cannot enforce it for whatever reason (such as a lack of funding), the patent is effectively toothless.\nBut your competitors will likely not know that.
