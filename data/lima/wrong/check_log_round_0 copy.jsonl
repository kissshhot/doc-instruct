Discuss the exact details of how something like this could happen and how it would effect history up to the present day.", "If Ming dynasty China had crossed the Pacific and settled the Americas during the 15th century, history as we know it would have been dramatically altered. Here is one speculation of how such a scenario might have unfolded and its potential repercussions up to the present day.\n\nReal History: In the early 1400s, the Ming dynasty, under Emperor Yongle, carried out ambitious naval expeditions led by Admiral Zheng He, who explored and established trade relations across the Indian Ocean and as far west as Africa.\n\nHypothetical Scenario: In this alternate history, Zheng He's fleet ventures further eastward, crossing the Pacific Ocean and reaching present-day California.\n\nHow does this scenario play out?\n\n* Upon discovering the Americas, the Chinese encounter indigenous civilizations and establish trading relations with them. This leads to the establishment of Chinese settlements along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Chinese settlers import advanced technologies, including gunpowder, paper, printing, and agricultural practices, transforming the lives of indigenous peoples. At the same time, the introduction of Old World diseases decimates indigenous populations, akin to the Columbian exchange in our timeline.\n\n* Over the 1500s and 1600s, hybrid Chinese-indigenous societies form throughout the Americas, forming unique cultures, languages, and religions. The trans-Pacific trade between China and its colonies sparks an economic golden age in China, making it the richest empire on Earth. By reinvesting its newfound wealth in its military, the Ming dynasty does not collapse as in our timeline, instead becoming the number one naval power in the world.\n\n* In parallel, Europeans do eventually arrive in the Americas and settle parts of the Atlantic coast. Contact between Chinese and European colonies, particularly in Central America, ignites a series of local conflicts, culminating in an acknowledgement of Chinese sovereignty over modern-day Mexico in exchange for civil and cultural rights for indigenous peoples and European settlers, enforced through a non-interventionist policy of the Chinese colonial government. By creating the world\u2019s first de facto multicultural territory, this agreement facilitates a steady flow of goods, technologies, and ideas between Chinese, European, and indigenous cultures, influencing humanistic ideologies that spread throughout the New World.\n\n* Throughout the 1700s and 1800s, a unique American identity emerges from the multicultural melting pot, based on universal humanist values. This new generation of Americans finds itself at odds with Old World notions of national identity and monarchy, and eventually rebel against Chinese, European, and other external influences. Some colonies gain independence during this period, while other territories are annexed by the newly-independent American countries over the following century.\n\n* By the present day, the American continents host nations that are independent of their original Old World colonies, much like in our timeline, though they differ in geographical borders and ethno-cultural composition. China is more powerful and prosperous in this timeline, having benefited from its American colonies for three centuries.\n\nTo conclude, had Ming dynasty China crossed the Pacific and settled the Americas in the 15th century, history would have been significantly different. It is important to remember that the scenario presented here is purely hypothetical, and that the actual historical events followed a different path, with European powers ultimately dominating the colonization of the New World."], "source": "authors", "questioner": "a historian, researcher, or student with a focus on ancient civilizations, maritime exploration, and alternative history scenarios.

Also after generating those points, what is the best way to visualize and check whether they are truly uniform on the surface $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$?", "A standard method is to generate three standard normals and construct a unit vector from them. That is, when $X_i \\sim N(0,1)$ and $\\lambda^2 = X_1^2 + X_2^2 + X_3^2$, then $(X_1/\\lambda, X_2/\\lambda, X_3/\\lambda)$ is uniformly distributed on the sphere.  This method works well for $d$-dimensional spheres, too.\nIn 3D you can use rejection sampling: draw $X_i$ from a uniform$[-1,1]$ distribution until the length of $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ is less than or equal to 1, then--just as with the preceding method--normalize the vector to unit length.  The expected number of trials per spherical point equals $2^3/(4 \\pi / 3)$ = 1.91.  In higher dimensions the expected number of trials gets so large this rapidly becomes impracticable.\nThere are many ways to check uniformity.  A neat way, although somewhat computationally intensive, is with Ripley's K function.  The expected number of points within (3D Euclidean) distance $\\rho$ of any location on the sphere is proportional to the area of the sphere within distance $\\rho$, which equals $\\pi\\rho^2$.  By computing all interpoint distances you can compare the data to this ideal.\nGeneral principles of constructing statistical graphics suggest a good way to make the comparison is to plot variance-stabilized residuals $e_i(d_{[i]} - e_i)$ against $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n(n-1)/2=m$ where $d_{[i]}$ is the $i^\\text{th}$ smallest of the mutual distances and $e_i = 2\\sqrt{i/m}$.

{"conversations": ["Why is digital photography so expensive?", "Digital photography is not expensive but buying into it is.\n\nWith film photography camera and lenses were a moderate investment but these lasted quite long. Even a battery in a film camera would last several years. Cameras and lenses were mechanical and much simpler than today's models. This made them require less expertise to manufacture and also made them incredibly sturdy. A lifespan of a decade for a camera and several decades for lenses was not uncommon.\n\nHowever, the real cost of film photography is film and development. Each roll of film costs several dollars and gives up to 36 images. Specialized rolls were more expensive and had fewer exposures. Then, if you did not do development yourself, you had to pay for development. Also prints. Even if you did your own, chemicals and papers were recurring costs. And there was the added expensive of creating a wet darkroom. In the end, the hobby was quite costly.\n\nWith digital photography, you pay nearly all costs up-front and it comes out much cheaper for anyone who is into the art and shoots regularly. A mid-range DSLR with good lens and memory can easily be obtained for less than $2500. Many entry level ones exist for under $1000. If you were to shoot 10,000 frames before both your camera and lens dies, it would cost you between 2.5&cent; to 10&cent; per frame. It is far far less than even just the film for each frame. Still most cameras have shutters rated to at least 100,000 frames and lenses last much longer than cameras. Even if you only captured 1000 images, you would have a better deal than with film photography. All digital cameras come with rechargeable batteries, good for 500-1000 shots-per-charge (for DSLRs) and can be charged at least 50-100 times before needing to be replaced. That means you actually will not use up the battery before you have taken full advantage of the better value of digital photography.\n\nMarket conditions are forcing the price of digital photography to increase. The loss of market share of compact and ultra-compact digital cameras to cellphones forced manufacturers to discontinue such products and concentrate on higher-end offering.

Nobody is seen wearing any sort of protective gear, not even hard hats or safety glasses.\n* Insecure rigging when lifting the test object upright.  A strap, particularly one being pulled at a sharp angle, is far less safe than a proper lifting point.\n* Bad angle when lifting the test object upright.  This puts excess loads on things, increasing the risk of a fall or failure.\n* Using unbraced legs as a pivot point when lifting the test object upright.  You can see they're on the verge of buckling.\n* (assumed) Lifting the test object while already fueled.  In the event of a fall, this ensures an explosion if the tanks rupture, as the fuels are hypergolic.\n* Having people stand under a suspended load.  If the test object falls, this will cause serious injury or death to at least two people.\n* Using a truck to pull the lifting cable.  This provides far less control than a proper winch.\n* Having personnel in the blast area of the test object.  In the event of an failure, this makes it highly likely that they will be engulfed in the fireball, struck by debris, or poisoned by fuel vapors.\n* Having personnel in the exhaust area of the test object.

{"conversations": ["How to deal with diagnosis of a rare chromosome disorder in a child?", "Most people have heard of Down syndrome. But there are hundreds of other chromosome disorders a child can have, many of which are diagnosed in only a few children, or may even be unique to that child.\n\n## Get information\n\n1. Learn about genetics. Most people have 46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. One pair is the sex chromosomes, which in males is usually XY and in females XX. The other 22 pairs, known as autosomes, are numbered by size, with chromosome 1 being the biggest. Each chromosome has a longer arm, called the q arm, and a shorter arm, called the p arm. Each arm has bands that are numbered, with the band closest to the middle (centromere) being numbered 11.1. Terminus (shortened to \"ter\") refers to a tip of a chromosome. A \"terminal\" chromosome disorder is not fatal; it just involves the terminus. Learn about the types of changes. Nullisomy means that there are zero copies of a chromosome. Deletion/monosomy means that there is only one copy of the chromosome or piece of chromosome. Duplication/trisomy means that there are 3 copies. Tetrasomy and pentasomy refer to 4 and 5 copies, respectively. Translocations are when chromosomes swap material. If it is balanced, this means the same number of copies of material is present, but they are arranged differently - for example they have part of 3q on 2q and part of 2q on 3q, but it all adds up to the same thing. If it is unbalanced, the child has trisomy and/or monosomy for some part of the involved chromosomes. Very often, an unbalanced translocation is inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation, but it can also occur as a new mutation, which is called 'de novo'. For example, they may have part of 2q missing and part of 3q in its place, causing partial monosomy of 2q and partial trisomy of 3q. In an unbalanced translocation, the abnormal chromosome is called the derivative chromosome, or der for short. So they may write t(2;3)der(2) to indicate the child has the 2 with chromosome 3 material instead of the 3 with chromosome 2 material.\n2. Find medical information on your child's condition. There may not be much out there, but find what you can, because it can give you an idea what to expect for your child. Be careful to pay attention to what specific chromosome region is affected, including what bands are involved - even though they both have 22q deletion, kids with 22q11 deletion have a totally different syndrome from 22q13 deletion. Also keep in mind duplication/trisomy versus deletion/monosomy, because these are genetic opposites. When reading medical case studies, remember that they focus on the negative. You're probably not going to hear the doctor talk about how sweet and caring the child is, or how much their parents feel lucky for knowing them, because it's not medically relevant. You will learn about some of the health problems your kid could face.\n3. See if parents have written about your child's condition. Depending on how rare the condition is, there may be other parents out there who have written about what it is like to raise a child who has it.\n4. Look for adults with your child's condition. Many adults with genetic disabilities are able to use computers when they become adults. Do any of them have blogs or social media accounts? They may be able to offer good advice. Here are some benefits of learning from adults with disabilities:\n\t* They can tell you about the parenting strategies that did and didn't help. They may be able to offer detailed advice about your child. Watching them can help you envision what your child's life will be like someday.\n\n\n## Cop\n\n1. Don't assume the worst. Many doctors, when they don't know the prognosis for a condition, will act like it's more severe than it really is. Even parents of kids with very mild chromosome disorders have been told their child will never walk or talk and/or will die in infancy. If your child has a rare syndrome, take dire prognoses with a grain of salt.\n2. Recognize that infancy is the worst time. For many chromosomal conditions, the first year or two of life are the hardest, as caregivers and healthcare providers try to figure out the child's needs. It won't always be this bad, and it's likely to get easier. If you've been told that your child may die, recognize that extreme early death usually happens in the first 3 years of life, or not at all. If your child is fine at age 4, they'll probably be fine at age 24 and age 44.\n3. Give yourself time to process. You may feel a range of emotions as you realize that your child's life will look different than you thought it would. This is normal. Don't expect yourself to adjust immediately.\n4. Tell other people how they can support you. People around you may want to help, but not know what they can do. Let them know what your family needs, and give them the opportunity to help. \"Between all the doctor appointments, we barely have time to cook. It would be really nice to have someone prepare a meal or maybe invite us for dinner once in a while.\" \"We could really use a babysitter on weekends.\" \"We're so busy for with the baby that the kids can feel left out. If they could go to your house to play with your kids sometimes, it might help cheer them up.\" \"I'm really worried about the upcoming surgery. My wife can't be there due to her conference. It would really help to have someone there with me.\"\n5. Make peace with the fact that life will be different. Your child is going to learn differently, behave differently, and show you how much they love you differently. Sometimes it will be harder, but there will also be beautiful parts. Remember that not every quirk is a deficit. Some differences are positives, and others are neither good nor bad. It's okay for your child to be unique.\n6. Take time for yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup, and you can't help your child much if you're physically and emotionally exhausted. Try to set aside a little \"me time\" each day, even if it's only 5 minutes. Ask yourself \"What would help me feel better right now?\" Could it be a shower? A cup of tea? A hug? Try to get it.\n\n\n## Move forward\n\n1. Seek out parent support groups. If you can find other parents of kids with the same or overlapping chromosome disorders, great, but even parents of kids with completely different conditions can be a great source of support. UNIQUE has leaflets on many rare conditions.\n2. Get therapy early. Early intervention is important. As soon as your child is medically stable, sign them up for physical, occupational and/or speech therapy - even if they are still a tiny baby. This will help them reach their full potential. Although very few kids with chromosome disorders are so affected that they can't walk or talk, most have some degree of cognitive or learning disability. The more they can do for themselves, the less support they will need from others in adulthood. Take notes during therapy and ask for activities that you can do at home. Bad therapists do exist. If a therapist tells you to be cruel or punitive towards your child, find a new therapist. Childhood should be fun, not scary. You don't want your child to gain an anxiety disorder along with their new skills.\n3. Make time for your child's siblings, if there are any. At times, they may feel left out, especially if you're busy taking care of your disabled child's needs. Try to spend quality time with each of your children every day. If you don't spend time with a child on one day, try to make up for it during the weekend.\n4. Celebrate your child! Your child is different, and they have their own special combination of traits that make them who they are. Love them for who they are, and treasure the good moments.

A Goliath could feasibly lift and throw a gnome, yet the Gnome, following rules as written, can pin down a Goliath, fairly easily, if statted correctly. \nIs there an in-universe explanation as to why such dramatically different sized creatures can wrestle on an even playing field?\nHow might a DM explain a scenario in which a gnome beats a goliath in any kind of test of strength?", "D&D is a terrible reality simulator.\nThe problem that you're having here is that, in real life, most people who are 7 feet tall are going to be faster, stronger, and all-around more physically powerful than a person who is 3 feet tall.  If you compare two people of similar athleticism, the person who is 4 feet taller is going to be able to physically dominate the other.\n\nHowever, D&D is not a game built to simulate reality.  It's a game built to let you play through stories about heroes who fight against a large variety of evil things.  It's built to let players build a wide array of kinds of hero, and let them generally be effective at their role, even if the character options they picked wouldn't work in real life.\n\nThis means that the game will let you build a gnome strongman, if that's the kind of character you want to play.  The designers wouldn't want your gnome strongman to be much worse at being a strongman than a character of a different race, so the only racial 'penalty' to being a strongman that you get is that you don't get a racial bonus to Strength.  All of this is based on intentional design choices to make as many player archetypes as possible viable.\n\nIn-universe, they'd explain this just like we would in real life.  If a really buff but physically small person wins, say, an arm-wrestling contest with someone pushing 7 feet, we'd be impressed.  It would be odd, for sure, but it wouldn't be something impossible.

Is it a formal idea?", "Suppose you have a theorem that says \"If $X$, then $Y$.\"  There are two ways to strengthen such a theorem:\n\n* Assume less.  If you can reduce the number of hypotheses, but still prove the same conclusion, then you have proved a more \"powerful\" result (in the sense that it applies in more situations).\n* Prove more.  If you can keep the same hypotheses, but add more information to the conclusion, then you have also produced a more \"powerful\" result.\n\nHere is an easy example from Geometry.\n\n  Let $ABCD$ be a (non-square) rectangle.

The conclusion that $WXYZ$ is a rectangle still holds.\n* Alternatively, you can keep the original hypothesis that $ABCD$ is a (non-square) rectangle, and strengthen to the conclusion to say that $WXYZ$ is not just a rectangle, but a square.\n* Having done that, you can then strengthen the conclusion of the theorem even more, by noting that the diagonal of square $WXYZ$ is equal in length to the difference of the lengths of the sides of $ABCD$.\n* Once you know that, you can now strengthen the theorem even more by (finally) removing the hypothesis that $ABCD$ is non-square, and including the  case in which the four angle bisectors coincide at a single point as forming a \"degenerate\" square with a diagonal of length zero.\n"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A student or mathematician with a keen interest in algebra, calculus, or number theory.

{"conversations": ["Why is there so much technical detail of whaling included in Moby-Dick?", "There are multiple purposes behind the novel structure of Moby-Dick.\n\nIn the first instance the author was himself a whaleman, having spent 18 months as an ordinary seaman aboard the whaler Acushnet in 1841\u201342. In his experience the literature of the day, such as Miriam \n\nCoffin or The Whale-Fisherman by Joseph Hart, did not portray whaling accurately but rather sensationalised it. He wished to provide his readers with a more realistic account.\n\nIn doing so, he also gave the reader the information necessary to better understand and appreciate the passages of whaling described in the novel. With the reader forewarned, he is able to keep the narrative passages tense and exciting. It is interesting that, early in the novel, the Pequod meets virutally no whales and that the chases become longer and more involved as the story progresses. This may be because Melville felt he needed to give the reader more and more technical information before they could fully appreicate these encounters, but understood the science would need to be spaced out among the narrative.\n\nIn describing it to the reader, the science also serves another useful narrative function. It indicates that on whaling voyages, long periods of time pass when nothing much happens at all. By padding out of the story with scientific digressions serves as a useful narrative metaphor for waiting.\n\nThe level of detail provided also mirrors one of the novel's central themes: obsession. Although Ishmael is the narrator and Ahab the obvious obsessive, the amount of science indicates that Ishmael is also an obsessive. His obsession is the business of whaling itself.\n\nFinally, Melville made good use of these passages in serving as metaphors for other themes of the novel where he felt it appropriate. For example in the chapter The Line, which describes how the whale line is stored and used in the boat, it ends by using the line as a metaphor.\n\n  \"All men live enveloped in whale-lines.

{"conversations": ["Are there any advantages while backpacking to hike during the night and sleep during the day?", "There are several reasons, though not all of them would apply for one's usual holiday trip.\n\n1. Remaining unseen: Obviously, during night its dark and this gives you a fair bit of cover if you want to remain unseen. This reason for traveling at night is common for many hunters in the animal kingdom (and sometimes also their prey), has been used by humans in insecure or hostile territory for centuries and remains a standard technique for some military operations even today. \n\n2. Evading the elements: Hiking throughout the night and resting in the day can be especially useful in hot, arid conditions. For example in deserts, extreme heat during the day and severe cold in the night often come together. Hiking during the night here serves the double purpose of keeping you active and warm when it is cold while allowing you to save water resources during the day.\n\n3. Boosting morale: When conditions get worse (cold, moisture), getting up during the night and starting to hike will not only make you feel warm again, it will also boost your morale. Being active, and actively coping with a bad situation rather than staying miserable in the tent for the rest of the night will make you feel better.\n\n4. You want to avoid tourists: No, seriously, this is a real case in point. Most people travel during the day and one of the reasons we (or at least, I) get outdoors is to enjoy some quietness in the wild. Depending where you are, hiking at night is your best bet to fulfill this dream.\n\n5. Navigation (only very theoretical): Consider a situation where it is all cloudy during the day (so you do not see the sun), you lack a compass and currently have no sense of direction: if you are capable of navigating with the stars, you might consider waiting until dark and hope that the sky will clear up until then.

{"conversations": ["Layman's explanation of encryption backdoors", "There are two somewhat orthogonal concepts in backdooring encryption algorithms:\n\n* The backdoor can be explicit or implicit. An explicit backdoor is one that everybody knows it is there. An implicit backdoor strives at remaining undetected by the algorithm owners. Of course, when there is an explicit backdoor, people tend to avoid the algorithm altogether, so explicit backdoors may hope to work only in the presence of a legal framework that forces implementers to use the backdoored system.\nAn example of an explicit backdoor is the Clipper chip (which was ultimately abandoned). The backdoor is not really in the algorithm, more in the assembly of algorithms into a protocol, and technically it was an automatic key escrowing method. For an implicit backdoor, see the Dual EC DRBG as a famous example: it worked only as long as nobody was aware that it was backdoored.\n* The backdoor's security may be quantifiable, or not. In the case of Dual EC DRBG, the mechanism uses well-trodden mathematical paths: the NSA knew that exploiting the backdoor required knowledge of an internal secret key, based on discrete logarithm (on elliptic curves).\nA non-quantifiable security is what happens when you try to push, for instance, a voluntarily flawed algorithm, or one for which you know of a cryptanalytic method that you did not publish. This is a very dangerous game for a spy agency, because you cannot really know whether third parties could find the flaw or not. Such backdooring tends to backfire in the long term.\nInterestingly, the NSA tends not to use non-quantifiable backdoors. A good example is DES. At the time it was designed, the NSA believed that it could tackle an upfront 256 exhaustive search, and that nobody else (in particular the Soviets) had the technology and budget for that. The NSA also knew of a novel cryptanalytic method (differential cryptanalysis). So when the NSA intervened in the design of DES, it insisted on shortening the key from 64 to 56 bits (that's addition of a quantifiable backdoor, and it was rather obvious, so quasi-explicit), and also on strengthening the design against differential cryptanalysis. This is a good example about how NSA consciously refrained from a non-quantifiable backdoor. There is only one thing that spy agencies fear more than not being able to spy: it is the idea that other competing spy agencies may also spy.\n\nSo a real, good backdoor is one that uses maths to offer quantifiable security against unauthorized usage of the backdoor. It is extremely difficult to have quantifiable security without making the backdoor explicit. The \"best in class\" in that area is Dual EC DRBG, and even before the Snowden business, cryptographers were already finding it weird and strongly suspected foul play (see the analyses back in 2007, 6 years before Snowden)."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A tech-savvy individual with a strong interest in cybersecurity and cryptography.

{"conversations": ["How to peacefully feed cats in multi\u2010cat households?", "## Feed multiple cat at once\n\n1. Feed discrete meals. Feeding all of your cats at one time, instead of letting them graze, will minimize conflict and fighting. Instead of allowing access to food at all times, which can lead to conflict when two cats want to eat from the same bowl at the same time, timed meals will allow all cats to have their own space and food to focus on. How often you feed your cats each day depends on your schedule. In many cases, it works best to feed your cats once in the morning before you leave and once again in the evening when you return. Provide food puzzles if you have a cat(s) that is used to grazing instead of eating at meal times. This will help them transition to timed meals. Putting a small amount of kibble in one of these puzzles won't replace a whole meal but it may satiate a cat enough until meal time comes around.\n2. Monitor feeding time. Do not feed your cats and then leave your home. It is important that you monitor feeding time, so that you can make the cats stay at their own feeding stations and break up any conflicts that might occur. It may be that your presence calms your cats while they eat because they know that they will be protected from other cats trying to get their food when you are around. This will allow them to focus on their food more than on defensiveness. If you see a cat trying to eat another cat's food, physically separate them. It's important that you do this so the more submissive cat doesn't get taken advantage of.\n3. Remove food dishes after 20-30 minutes. When feeding multiple cats you should remove food dishes after the cats have eaten or after 20-30 minutes, if one or more of your cats are very slow about eating. This will teach the cats that there is a set time to eat and if they don't eat at that given time, then there is no food to be had. The goal is to make meal time a time for strictly for eating, not a time to play games, show dominance, or fight for territory. Setting specific meal times and taking away food when meal time is over requires a gradual training process that may take some time for your cats to adjust to. If your cat meows repeatedly at you for food when it is not meal time, just remember that you are working to make a peaceful household and your cat will not starve if it has to wait an hour for food.\n4. Use calming sprays. If your cats are very territorial and tend to fight over food, you may want to try using a calming product made for cats during feeding times. These products tend to be non-toxic sprays that use pheromones to calm cats and reduce fear and aggression. Spray one of these products, which are usually available at most pet stores, around the feeding area or on the specific cats that are most fearful or aggressive. The pheromone sprays used for calming cats mimic the pheromones given off by mother cats to calm their kittens.\n\n\n## Set up separate feed station\n\n1. Give each cat its own dish. When feeding multiple cats, competition can be fierce if every cat doesn't have its own dish to eat from. Separate dishes allow each cat to have their own space and their own food to focus on, instead of focusing on defending against another cat. Make sure that the food bowls are as identical as possible. You do not want to create competition for a food dish that is easier to eat out of or is slightly bigger. Don't forget to place a water bowl near each food bowl. In most cases, when you first set out multiple food dishes the cats will naturally gravitate to one of their own. Once they have basically picked their bowls, make them stick to them to establish their territories.\n2. Don't place food dishes against walls. In many cases, a cat in a multi-cat household will want to be in a position while eating where it can see any other cats coming towards it. If you place food dishes against a wall, the cat will naturally be forced to have its back to the wall. This may add to its anxiety and not allow it to relax during eating. Placing your cat's bowl even a foot away from the wall should allow it to sit in any place around the bowl that it feels is best.\n3. Place the cats as far away from each other as possible. When feeding cats in a multiple cat household, you need to space them away from each other. This may mean that you place food dishes in separate corners of the same room or you place feeding stations in completely separate rooms. Giving all your cats space from other cats will allow them to better focus on their food instead of turf wars or food competition. It is ideal if your cats cannot see each other during meal time. This add tremendously to your cat's ability to focus on food instead of the other cats.\n4. Isolate cats eating different foods. If your cats eat different food, it is important that you feed them in different spaces. This will help you to keep each cat eating the food that it is supposed to eat and it will prevent fights over whatever food your cats consider the tastiest. It may be that one of your cats eats different food and your other cats eat the same food. If this is the case, only the cat with different food needs to be isolated during meal time. Cats that are eating different food need to be kept separate until all cats in the household are done eating. The will remove the temptation to sneak a bite from the bowl of the last cat eating.\n5. Try adding an extra feeding dish if problems persist. Adding 1 more dish than the number of cats you have can help eliminate any chances of conflict. With an extra bowl, your cats won't have a problem finding somewhere to eat in peace. For example, if you have 2 cats, you could try adding a third feeding dish. If you add an additional feeding dish, make sure you put a water dish nearby.\n\n\n## Avoid conflict\n\n1. Coax cats to their own bowls. If more than one cat goes to one bowl at mealtime, you should coax the cat away who does not normally eat at that bowl. This could be done by picking the cat up, calling to it, or luring it towards its own bowl with a bit of food. This separation will prevent territorial disputes and conflict during meal time. There can be power dynamics between cats that they need to sort out themselves. When cats are initially establishing whose dish is whose, there may be some switching up that occurs.\n2. Stop fights right away. When fights break out over territory or food you should break them up right away. Fighting over food, especially between cats who usually get along, can lead to unhealthy aggression, so it should be stopped before it gets serious. If you have two cats that repeatedly fight over food dishes, these cats should be fed in different rooms.\n3. Avoid conflict before it starts. In order to have a peaceful household with multiple cats, you may need to resort to keeping certain cats away from each other most of the time, which includes meal time. This will allow you to avoid conflict before it begins and it allows both cats to have peaceful and calm time in their homes. If you have a very small home, this can be difficult to achieve. Keeping cats that don't get along separated works better if you have a large house or at least several rooms that can be closed off. You can also try feeding aggressive cats in cat carriers. That way they won't be able to run around and harass your other cats when they're finished eating. While it is true that some cats may have conflict at first and then learn to get along, that is not always the case. If you have tried to get your cats to get along and nothing seems to work, it may be time to give them separate territories in your home.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A cat owner or animal lover who is currently managing a household with multiple cats.

{"conversations": ["Summarize the following article with one line: \nWhen journalist Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's rapidly growing, yet unregulated, gestational surrogacy industry for HBO documentary series Vice, she didn't anticipate 'how dark' the story would get.\n\nFor nearly two years, the producer and host has been reporting on current issues across the globe and has covered everything from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay to the effect of climate change on polar bears - but nothing could have prepared her for the moment when someone offered to sell her a baby over dinner while she was working undercover in India. \n\n'It was the most heartbreaking experience that I ever had,' Gianna told Daily Mail Online.  \n\nBaby business: Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni (pictured) traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry \n\nShady deal: The journalist from Brooklyn, New York, went undercover to meet with an agent in India who offered to get her a baby in two to three months\n\nBut the heartbreak did not end there.\n\nAs Gianna quickly learned during her time working on the Outsourcing Embryos documentary, surrogacy in India is a multi-million dollar business, and one which is made all the more lucrative by the high number of American couples traveling to the country in order to use the services provided by one or more of the 'embryo outsourcing' agencies featured in the Vice documentary.\n\nDuring her time spent undercover posing as one of these people, Gianna was informed that, in order to maximize profits and ensure a final product, doctors are encouraged to implant multiple embryos in surrogates, which can lead to the surrogate having to abort one of the fetuses or give birth to multiple babies.\n\nAnd if an 'extra' baby is born, it isn't necessarily going home with its genetic parents. There are also issues with couples never making it to India to claim their children for whatever reasons, meaning that the newborn baby is left without a parent. \n\nFor the most recent episode in the Vice series, Gianna went undercover to meet with one surrogacy agent who claimed over dinner that she could get her a Caucasian baby in two to three months - confirming that there were in fact 'extra' babies being sold on the black market.\n\nThe agent then tried to convince Gianna and her team to buy the baby that they had brought with them to the restaurant.\n\nShocking offer: One of the agents can be seen holding the baby that they brought to the restaurant with them\n\nNo morals: The agent eventually offered to sell Gianna and her team the baby over dinner \n\nGianna noted that the agent spoke with a 'shocking amount of ease' and 'talked about forging documents as if she has done it a hundred times' as she tried to sell her and her team a baby over dinner.\n\n'It made me think it wasn't a one-off thing,' she explained to Daily Mail Online. \n\nGianna never once considered buying the baby, but as a woman who would one day like to be a mother, she admitted that there was a moment when she thought about accepting the offer, knowing that she could provide the child with a loving home that it may never experience otherwise, particularly as it was made clear that the agent would have sold the baby to anybody.\n\n'When I go on these stories, I am a human being first and a journalist second,' she said of her initial reaction to the offer.\n\nThe sale of 'extra' babies on the black market was just one of the many shocking side effects of commercial surrogacy uncovered by Gianna and her team.\n\nIn the US, surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $100,000, and Gianna explained that 'the reoccurring theme' when speaking with American agents and experts about couples hiring surrogates from other countries was money.\n\nCommercial surrogacy in India costs nearly one-sixth the amount it would in the Western World.\n\n'That seems to be the main driver,' she explained, before noting that some prospective parents do choose foreign surrogacy because of the altruistic element.\n\nNo options: Many of the surrogates who spoke with Gianna said that they decided to carry a baby because they desperately needed the money \n\nDormitory: The women who agree to be surrogates at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic have to live at the facility until they give birth\n\nTight quarters: Two surrogates can be see sitting on the beds in their shared room \n\nAnd while American parents see the surrogacy business in India as being a 'cheap' alternative to the services offered at home, the amount of money made by a surrogate in India can vastly change her life, as well as the life of her family.  \n\nWomen can use the money to buy a home or send their own children to school, and Gianna explained that there are in fact couples who take great efforts to make sure their surrogates are a part of their lives.\n\nBut there are also countless tales of financially desperate women who are recruited in the slums and coerced into signing contracts that they can't read, only to be duped out of the money they were promised.\n\nWhen I go on these stories I am a human being first and a journalist second\n\nSurrogates undergo scheduled cesarean sections so doctors can ensure the greatest number of births per day.\n\nGianna, who witnessed the high turnover rate first hand at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic, in the town of Gujarat, in the west of India, was nearly speechless when she saw how rapidly newborns and their parents were whisked away following a surrogate's C-section.\n\nDr Patel maintained that the women are well taken care of and make more money than they could working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in any other profession.\n\nAnd while Gianna explained that some women are happy that they can provide a house for their family and put their kids through school as a surrogate, the women she and her team spoke to said they chose to be surrogates because they didn't have any other options.   \n\nDuring the episode, a surrogate named Vasanti told Gianna: 'Nobody likes doing this.' \n\nDishonest: Although Dr Patel maintained that she didn't search for surrogates from the slums, Gianna met a woman who said she was working for the clinic owner as tried to recruit women from a poor area \n\nNo choice: A doctor can be seen performing a cesarean section on one of the surrogates. Surrogates have to undergo C-sections so doctors can maximize the amount of babies being born in a day \n\nToo quick: Almost immediately after this baby was born via a surrogate, the biological parents whisked the newborn away in a van as they went to return to their home country \n\nShe continued: 'I didn't have a home, so I thought I could build one by being a surrogate.'\n\nAnother surrogate named Nisha explained that she was 'helpless' and had 'no alternatives'.\n\nGianna was overcome by many of the surrogates' desperation.\n\n'It is really hard to hear someone talk about going through an experience that takes a toll on the body, that lasts longer than nine months and takes them away from their kids because they have to support their families and essentially survive,' she said.\n\nGianna recalled speaking with one surrogate's husband who recently lost his job and he confessed that he was grateful his wife had the opportunity to earn money for their family as a surrogate.\n\nHe made clear that he didn't force her into the role, but explained that it was necessary for their family's survival.\n\n'It all went back to money,' Gianna noted.\n\nAs a whole, Gianna said that she thinks some parents may be aware of the 'shadier side' of commercialized surrogacy, but a 'vast majority' have no idea this dark underbelly exits.\n\nGianna recommends that parents who are considering foreign surrogacy options should do extensive research on the agent, the doctor and the surrogate they will be working with.", "Here is the summary: \nVice correspondent Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry for the HBO series.

{"conversations": ["In our computer systems lecture we were introduced to the MIPS processor. It was (re)developed over the course of the term and has in fact been quite easy to understand. It uses a RISC design, that is its elementary commands are regularly encoded and there are only few of them in order to keep the wires simple.\nIt was mentioned that CISC follows a different philosophy. I looked briefly at the x86 instruction set and was shocked. I can not image how anyone would want to build a processor that uses so complex a command set!\nSo I figure there have to be good arguments why large portions of the processor market use CISC architectures. What are they? ", "There is a general historical trend.\nIn the olden days, memories were small, and so programs were perforce small. Also, compilers were not very smart, and many programs were written in assembler, so it was considered a good thing to be able to write a program using few instructions. Instruction pipelines were simple, and processors grabbed one instruction at a time to execute it. The machinery inside the processor was quite complex anyway; decoding instructions was not felt to be much of a burden. \nIn the 1970s, CPU and compiler designers realized that having such complex instructions was not so helpful after all. It was difficult to design processors in which those instructions were really efficient, and it was difficult to design compilers that really took advantage of these instructions. Chip area and compiler complexity was better spent on more generic pursuits such as more general-purpose registers. The Wikipedia article on RISC explains this in more detail.\nMIPS is the ultimate RISC architecture, which is why it's taught so often.\nThe x86 family is a bit different. It was originally a CISC architecture meant for systems with very small memory (no room for large instructions), and has undergone many successive versions. Today's x86 instruction set is not only complicated because it's CISC, but because it's really a 8088 with a 80386 with a Pentium possibly with an x86_64 processor.\nIn today's world, RISC and CISC are no longer the black-and-white distinction they might have been once. Most CPU architectures have evolved to different shades of grey.\nOn the RISC side, some modern MIPS variants have added multiplication and division instructions, with a non-uniform encoding. ARM processors have become more complex: many of them have a 16-bit instruction set called Thumb in addition to the \u201coriginal\u201d 32-bit instructions, not to mention Jazelle to execute JVM instructions on the CPU. Modern ARM processors also have SIMD instructions for multimedia applications: some complex instructions do pay after all.\nOn the CISC side, all recent processors are to some extent RISC inside. They have microcode to define all these complex macro instructions. The sheer complexity of the processor makes the design of each model take several years, even with a RISC design, what with the large number of components, with pipelining and predictive execution and whatnot.\nSo why do the fastest processors remain CISC outside? Part of it, in the case of the x86 (32-bit and 64-bit) family, is historical compatibility. But that's not the whole of it. In the early 2000s, Intel tried pushing the Itanium architecture. Itanium is an extreme case of complex instructions (not really CISC, though: its design has been dubbed EPIC). It even does away with the old-fashioned idea of executing instructions in sequence: all instructions are executed in parallel until the next barrier. One of the reasons Itanium didn't take is that nobody, whether at Intel or elsewhere, could write a decent compiler for it. Now a good old mostly-sequential processor like x86_64, that's something we understand."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "a computer science student or professional with a focus on hardware design and architecture.

{"conversations": ["How to make ricotta cheese?", "Ricotta cheese, the delicious key ingredient in Italian dishes from lasagna to cannoli, is simple to make in your own kitchen. Homemade ricotta cheese requires just a few ingredients, and the result is lighter and fresher than store-bought cheese. See Step 1 and beyond to learn how to make a batch today.\n\n## Milk-based ricotta\n\n1. Prepare the strainer. Line the fine-mesh strainer with a large piece of cheesecloth, and set it over the nonreactive bowl. Set this contraption on your work surface so to have it ready for the cheese mixture. If you don't use cheesecloth, it will be difficult to separate the cheese curds from the whey. You can substitute a double layer of paper towels or a thin cotton dishcloth in a pinch.\n2. Heat the milk, cream and salt. Place the milk, cream and salt in the saucepan and heat the mixture over medium-high heat. Allow it to heat until it reaches 200 degrees F. When the mixture is hot enough, turn off the heat and move the saucepan so the milk can begin to cool. It should take about 5 minutes to reach the correct temperature. Stir the mixture as it's heating to prevent it from scorching on the bottom. Use your candy thermometer or an instant-read thermometer to determine whether the mixture has reached the right temperature. If you don't let it cook long enough, the curds won't separate from the whey. If you overcook it, the texture will be ruined.\n3. Slowly add the vinegar. Use one hand to stir constantly while the other hand slowly pours the vinegar into the heated milk and cream mixture. The vinegar will cause the curds to coagulate and separate from the whey. You'll see solid bits forming and floating to the top of the liquid. Keep stirring until all of the vinegar has been added. The curdling agent in this case is vinegar, but some people prefer to use other substances. Try substituting 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of lemon juice for a different flavor. For a more traditional touch, try using animal rennet as your coagulant. Mix 1 teaspoon of rennet with 1/4 cup of cold water, then stir it into the milk mixture.\n4. Let the mixture sit until it's thick. Wait about 10 - 20 minutes for the coagulant to go to work and cause the curds to separate from the whey. It's ready when the curds have floated to the top to form a thick layer, leaving the liquid whey underneath.\n5. Ladle the curds into the strainer. Scoop out the thick top layer of curds and ladle them over the cheesecloth-covered strainer. Keep ladling out the curds until all that's left in the saucepan is the whey. You can discard the whey at this point.\n6. Let the ricotta drain. Wait at least an hour for the last of the whey to drain from the ricotta through the cheesecloth into the bowl. It will take about half an hour for the ricotta to fully drain. Don't attempt to stir it or push it through the cheesecloth, as this will just push the curds into the cloth. If you'd like a creamier final product, stop draining the ricotta after 5 - 10 minutes. For a drier final product, wait an hour for it to drain.\n7. Spoon the ricotta into a bowl. The finished ricotta is now ready to use in your favorite recipe. It's delicious as part of a savory dish or a dessert. Ricotta will keep in the refrigerator for about a week.\n\n\n## Whey-based ricotta\n\n1. Save the whey from making cheese in a non-reactive pot. When you make homemade cheese, you'll have curds at the bottom of the pot, and you'll pour off the whey. Filter as many of the curd particles out as you can since they would otherwise form tough \"beads\" in the final ricotta. Cover the whey and let it sit for at least 12 hours at room temperature to develop sufficient acidity. Acidified whey acts as its own coagulant, making it unnecessary to add vinegar or lemon juice to separate the curds.\n2. Heat the acidified whey. Pour it into a saucepan and heat it while stirring, taking care to avoid sticking or burning. Heat until the temperature has risen to about 175 degrees Fahrenheit and a white appears on the surface. Continue heating and stirring until the temperature reaches 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Note that the foam will build up somewhat. Be careful. If it boils, it can boil over.\n3. Remove the whey from heat and wait for it to curdle. Cover it and allow it to cool undisturbed until comfortable to the touch. The curds will soon appear like clouds suspended in the whey, while the whey will be clear and yellowish green.\n4. Strain the ricotta. Do not stir up the curd. Instead, set up a receiving pot with a large strainer and a fine clean cloth on top. Ladle the curds into the cloth, leaving the whey in the saucepan. Discard the whey. Be sure to scoop out the curds gently. Because the curds are very fine and delicate, they can stop up the cloth easily. This will cause very slow draining if they are broken up.\n5. Drain the whey through the cloth. It can take 2-3 hours for the whey to completely drain. If you prefer, you can set the strainer in the refrigerator and let it drain overnight.\n6. Remove the ricotta from the cloth. Pack it into a container, cover it and store in the refrigerator. Use it soon after making. Ricotta will keep up to a week in the refrigerator. Alternatively, ricotta freezes very well.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A health-conscious individual with an interest in fermentation and DIY projects.

{"conversations": ["Why doesn't the nuclear fusion in a star make it explode?", "The fusion that occurs in the core of the Sun occurs in nothing like the conditions you might be thinking of in a bomb, or a fusion reactor. In particular, it occurs at much lower temperatures and at a much lower rate. A cubic metre of material in the solar core is only releasing around 250\u00a0W of power by fusion.\nThe fusion rate is set by the temperature (and to a lesser extent, density) of the core. This in turn is set by the need for a pressure gradient to balance the weight of material pressing down on it from above. At 15 million kelvin (the core temperature, which is much lower than the temperatures in nuclear bombs or fusion reactors), the average proton has a lifetime of several billion years before being converted (with three others) into a helium nucleus. There are two reasons this is slow. First, you have to get protons, which repel each other electromagnetically, close enough together to feel the strong nuclear force. This is why high temperatures are needed. Second, because the diproton is unstable, one of the protons needs to change into a neutron via a weak force interaction, whilst it is in the unstable diproton state, to form a deuterium nucleus. This is just inherently unlikely and means the overall reaction chain to helium is very slow.\nThe reason there is no bomb-like explosion is because there is no problem in shifting 250\u00a0W per cubic metre away from the core, in the same way that a compost heap, which generates about the same power density, does not spontaneously explode. In the case of a star any additional heat goes into more radiation that diffuses away and in work done in expanding the star. As a result, the temperature of the core is stable.  Ultimately, any additional energy emerges as sunlight at the solar photosphere.\nIf for some reason, the opacity to radiation in the core increased, then the temperature would rise and more energy would be generated by fusion. This is exactly what happens in the core as more hydrogen is turned into helium; the core temperature and luminosity do rise, but slowly, on timescales of billions of years."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A curious and intellectually inquisitive individual with a strong interest in astrophysics and the fundamental processes that govern the universe.

{"conversations": ["How to celebrate chuseok?", "\"\ucd94\uc11d\" or \"Chuseok\" is a Korean harvest festival celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar. It is a very popular festival for Koreans as they reunite with their relatives and prepare for a feast. The origin of Chuseok is unsure but it has some traditional rites to be maintained. Thus Chuseok is celebrated in the rich harvest season when fruit and grain are abundant. Using the newly harvested rice, people make steamed rice, rice cakes, and liquor.\n\n## Pray and traditional customs\n\n1. Perform Charye or \ucc28\ub840. This is an ancestral memorial service where the entire family gathers together to perform the memorial service in the morning wearing hanbok. Charye is performed because Koreans believe that their ancestors aren't physically dead; their spirits are still alive. They prepare special food in their honor. Observe the important table arrangement for the Charye feast. Rice and soup are placed on the north side of the table, and fruits and vegetables are on the south. On the west and in the middle, meat dishes are served. On the east, rice cake and some drinks such as makgeolli or soju are placed.\n2. Practice Beolcho \"\ubc8c\ucd08\" and Seongmyo \"\uc131\ubb18\". Visit the ancestral graves and clean the weeds around the graves. This shows respect and devotion to one another. One month prior to the Chuseok, the families visit their ancestors' graves to clean the weeds, a practice which is called Beolcho, often causing congestion in Korea's highways. They again visit and clean the weeds around the graves during Chuseok.\n\n\n## Entertainment\n\n1. Play Ssireum. A Korean folk game similar to wrestling, it is extremely popular during the festival. Two competitors wrestle in the center of a sandpit and try to knock the other person over by using strength, skill and intelligence. It is a one on one tournament and the last person remaining wins the game.\n2. Perform the folk dance Kanggangsullae. This is a folk dance especially performed by women. They usually link arms and dance in a circle under the moonlight.\n3. Perform Sonori or Geobuknori. \"So\" and \"Geobuk\" literally mean \"cow\" and \"turtle\" in Hangeul. This celebration is a ritual performed by two people wearing a cape made of hanji and running around the local area as a cow and turtle, asking for foods from neighbors. The foods are often shared with relatives who can't afford Chuseok meals.\n\n\n## Food\n\n1. Eat songpyeon or \"\uc1a1\ud3b8\". This is a Korean traditional stuffed rice cake served as the Chuseok meal. The stuffings are made of healthy ingredients like sesame seeds, beans, nuts and honey. It is crucial to steam those cakes on pine-needles. It enhances the taste and fragrance along with the meaning of Songpyeon. Songpyeon is also significant because of the meaning contained in its shape. Songpyeon's rice skin itself resembles the shape of a full moon, but once it wraps the stuffing, its shape resembles the half-moon. There's a saying that the prettier you shape your songpyeon, the prettier your future daughter will be.\n2. Enjoy Hangwa. It is made with highly nutritious ingredients, such as rice flour, honey, fruit, and roots. People use edible natural ingredients to express various colors, flavors, and tastes. A few types of Hangwa are Yakgwa, Yugwa and Dasik, which are widely common as Korean confectionery items.\n3. Note that the name \"Hangwa\" is similar to another name for Chuseok, \"Hangawi\".\n4. Drink traditional liquors. These drinks are another significant and traditional side for a Chuseok feast. On Chuseok, families and relatives gather together and hold a memorial service for their ancestors with liquor made of the newly harvest rice. After the memorial service, they sit together and spend some time together as a family, drinking the liquor and eating the food.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual with an interest in Indian culture and traditions, seeking to learn about the customs and practices associated with Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.

{"conversations": ["What are some of the advantages of using one over the other?", "ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC are two web frameworks developed by Microsoft - they are both good choices.  Neither of the web frameworks are to be replaced by the other nor are there plans to have them 'merged' into a single framework.  Continued support and development are done in parallel by Microsoft and neither will be 'going away'.\nEach of these web frameworks offers advantages/disadvantages - some of which need to be considered when developing a web application.  A web application can be developed using either technology - it might make development for a particular application easier selecting one technology versus the other and vice versa.\nASP.NET Web Forms:\n\n* Development supports state\n\u2022   Gives the illusion that a web application is aware of what the user has been doing, similar to Windows applications.  I.e. Makes 'wizard' functionality a little bit easier to implement.  Web forms does a great job at hiding a lot of that complexity from the developer.\n* Rapid Application Development (RAD)\n\u2022   The ability to just 'jump in' and start delivering web forms.  This is disputed by some of the MVC community, but pushed by Microsoft.  In the end, it comes down to the level of expertise of the developer and what they are comfortable with.  The web forms model probably has less of a learning curve to less experienced developers.\n* Larger control toolbox\n\u2022   ASP.NET Web Forms offers a much greater and more robust toolbox (web controls) whereas MVC offers a more primitive control set relying more on rich client-side controls via jQuery (Javascript).\n* Mature\n\u2022   It's been around since 2002 and there is an abundance of information with regards to questions, problems, etc.  Offers more third-party control - need to consider your existing toolkits.\n\nASP.NET MVC:\n\n* Separation of concerns (SoC)\n\u2022   From a technical standpoint, the organization of code within MVC is very clean, organized and granular, making it easier (hopefully) for a web application to scale in terms of functionality.  Promotes great design from a development standpoint.\n* Easier integration with client side tools (rich user interface tools)\n\u2022   More than ever, web applications are increasingly becoming as rich as the applications you see on your desktops.  With MVC, it gives you the ability to integrate with such toolkits (such as jQuery) with greater ease and more seamless than in Web Forms.\n* Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Friendly / Stateless\n\u2022   URL's are more friendly to search engines (i.e.  mywebapplication.com/users/ 1 - retrieve user with an ID of 1 vs mywebapplication/users/getuser.aspx (id passed in session)).  Similarly, since MVC is stateless, this removes the headache of users who spawn multiple web browsers from the same window (session collisions).  Along those same lines, MVC adheres to the stateless web protocol rather than 'battling' against it.\n* Works well with developers who need high degree of control\n\u2022   Many controls in ASP.NET web forms automatically generate much of the raw HTML you see when an page is rendered.  This can cause headaches for developers.  With MVC, it lends itself better towards having complete control with what is rendered and there are no surprises.  Even more important, is that the HTML forms typically are much smaller than the Web forms which can equate to a performance boost - something to seriously consider.\n* Test Driven Development (TDD)\n\u2022   With MVC, you can more easily  create tests for the web side of things.  An additional layer of testing will provide yet another layer of defense against unexpected behavior.\n\nAuthentication, authorization, configuration, compilation and deployment are all features that are shared between the two web frameworks."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A tech-savvy IT manager or CTO in a growing business, seeking to optimize their data storage and processing capabilities.

These points are called 0 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C, respectively. The number 100 arose because we're used to numbers that are powers of ten because we use the base-ten system. The Celsius degree is \"one percent\" of the temperature difference.\n\nThere also exists the minimum temperature that one may achieve. In Kelvin degrees, it's sensible to call this minimum 0 K: that's a primary condition on the \"natural\" temperature scales such as the Kelvin scale. If one insists that one Kelvin degree is equally large as one Celsius degree as a unit of temperature difference, it just turns out that the melting point of ice has to be 273.15 K and the boiling point of water is 373.15 K.

Depth of field gets drastically shallower when you start to get really close. This is important as at macro focussing distances DoF is a major problem. It also means you can get shallow DoF regardless of aperture if you get close enough, and that if you want deep DoF in low light compose to focus further away.\n* Focal length. This does affect depth of field, but only in certain ranges, when maintaining subject size. Wide lenses have very deep depth of field at most subject distances. Once you get past a certain point, DoF changes very little with focal length. This is important again because if you want to increase / decrease DoF you can use focal length to do this whilst still filling the frame with your subject.\n* Sensor size. This affects DoF when you maintain the same subject distance and field of view between sensor sizes. The bigger the sensor the shallower the depth of field. DSLRs have much bigger sensors than compacts, and so for the same FoV and f-ratio they have shallower DoF. This is important because by the same token cropping images increases DoF when maintaining the same final output size, as it's akin to using a smaller sensor.\n"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A photography enthusiast or a professional photographer with a keen interest in understanding the technical aspects of photography, particularly depth of field.

{"conversations": ["How to manage urinary incontinence in children?", "Urinary incontinence (UI) is a medical term that refers to the loss of bladder control, which leads to accidental urine loss. This can happen during the day or at night. Urinary incontinence is a condition that affects many children when they are young and disappears as they grow and develop. To provide better support for your child with UI, it is important to understand how UI works and possible management solutions.\n\n## Understand the bladder\n\n1. Know how the bladder works. The bladder is a bodily organ that is essentially a muscular storage sack for urine. Normally, the bladder muscle sack can stay relaxed and expand to accept urine for several hours. The muscle that forms the bladder sack is called the detrusor muscle, which is also responsible for bladder emptying. The other main muscles of the bladder are called the sphincters, which are two rings of muscle surrounding the bladder outlet through which it empties. One sphincter is involuntary (you aren't aware of it) and the other is usually under our control, making it our voluntary sphincter. The latter is the muscle you can use to hold the urine back until you go to the bathroom.\n2. Learn about bladder control. There are nerves in your body that provides you with the sensation of bladder fullness. This is the early warning system that the bladder is ready to empty. When you urinate, the nerves to the detrusor muscle signal it to contract or squeeze, while at the same time, the nerves to the involuntary sphincter make it relax. When you release your voluntary sphincter, you allow yourself to urinate. By around age two, most children become aware that the sensation that they feel \u201cdown there\u201d is the need for the bladder to empty. This allows them to express the need to go to the bathroom. About a year later, they develop the ability to \u201chold it\u201d until they have a chance to go to the bathroom.\n3. Be aware of the causes of incontinence. There are issues that can cause problems when a child is learning how to \u201chold it\u201d. While most kids develop the ability to hold their urine and go to the bathroom when they have the opportunity to do so, problems can arise that can mess up a child's ability to control her bladder. These issues that are related to childhood incontinence can include:\n\t* A bladder that is unable to store the usual amount of urine. Weakness of the detrusor muscles or sphincter. Structural abnormalities of the urinary tract. The body producing larger amounts of urine than is normal. Bladder irritation from infections, such as urinary tract infections, or other bladder irritants. The bladder receiving unexpected and premature nerve signals to empty. Something in the area of the bladder keeping it from filling completely, such as other excrement caused by constipation. Excessive postponement of urination, or holding it for too long. Chronic constipation.\n4. Disregard the myths about incontinence. If your child has been dealing with incontinence for an extended period of time, chances are she is dealing with more of an issue that simply being too lazy to get to the bathroom. A lot of parents tend to think that daytime incontinence is a display of laziness, but it is important to keep in mind that something else might be causing your child to have accidents. Common thoughts that parents have that should probably be ruled out if your child has been dealing with incontinence for awhile. In these situations, you should know that:\n\t* Children who wet themselves are not just too lazy to go to the bathroom. Children who wet themselves are not too busy playing or watching TV. Children who wet themselves want to go to the bathroom and do not willfully wet themselves. Children who wet themselves do not choose to wait until the last minute. Wetting themselves does bother them.\n\n\n## Treat incontinence\n\n1. Look for signs of an overactive bladder. There are some common signs that your child has an overactive bladder. Signs that your child might have an incontinence problem related to under filling include:\n\t* Your child dashes to the bathroom, crosses her legs, and wiggles or drops to the floor, sitting hard on her heel. If asked, your child will often admit that she releases a little urine on the way to the bathroom. Many children also will admit that, sometimes, they run to the bathroom but only void a small amount of urine, even though they felt like they really needed to go.\n2. Look out for a cause for the \"sudden-urge-to-urinate\" phase. Some kids, while they are growing up, go through a phase where they suddenly, without warning, need to go to the bathroom really badly. This underdeveloped control, which presents itself as urge incontinence, often resolves with time as the child matures. However, this can also be the symptoms of a functionally small bladder or an overactive bladder. There are some medications that can actually increase a bladder's holding capacity. You should talk to a doctor about the options for dealing with a small or overactive bladder.\n3. Be aware of overfilling. There is a filling condition, called overfilling, that can also lead to incontinence. Overfilling is a less common condition that occurs when the bladder won't or can't empty and has an usually large capacity. Symptoms of an abnormally large capacity bladder include:\n\t* Voiding large volumes of urine frequently during the day. This can happen if the kidneys produce enormous volumes of urine. You should take your child to a doctor if you notice your child voiding a large amount of urine every time she goes to the bathroom, especially if there is a change in the amount from usual. Infrequent voiding, which is considered less than two or three times a day. This can be a sign of a spinal nerve problem, such as spina bifida or cerebral palsy. If your child has not been diagnosed with a spinal nerve problem, it is unlikely that this is the cause of your child's incontinence.\n4. Notice if your child is holding it for too long. Sometimes, if your child gets in the habit of holding his urine too long, it can result in over filling of the bladder. Your child's bladder can become enlarged if he is a chronic urine holder, which means he avoids going to the bathroom, even when he really, really has to pee. When this goes on for a long time, the muscles related to urinating become over trained, which means the muscles relax poorly, leading to bladder dysfunction like incontinence. This happens frequently when a child does not want to use the bathroom at school or other public places.\n5. Consider behavior modification therapy. Behavioral modification may be able to help your child with her urge incontinence. Most experts today favor behavior modification therapy over drugs as a first line treatment for daytime wetting of almost all types. Behavior modification is a method of training to relearn a skill such as bladder control. The therapy must be done strictly and consistently in order to get the desired results, such as your child being able to control her bladder. Behavior modification therapy generally works best in children who are older than five or six years of age. This is because younger children generally lack the self-discipline to stick to the therapy schedule. However, each child should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Child psychologists can provide good advice on how to go about creating a schedule.\n6. Create a schedule. If your child suffers from an overactive bladder, you need to create a schedule to help him. After your child goes to the bathroom in the morning, begin a strict timed voiding schedule. Normally, parents pick every two hours as the scheduled voiding time. Your child must go to the bathroom every two hours, even if he says he doesn't have to go at that specific time. That is actually the point, to get him to the bathroom before he has a bladder spasm. If you wait for the bladder spasm, you are reinforcing the absence of control. If your child does go and attempts to void, even a little, it reinforces his control about when and where he goes. If your child has an overfilled bladder, you should create the same schedule with an added step. Your child should wait four to five minutes after going to the bathroom and then try to go again. This is called double voiding in an attempt to reduce that lingering bladder volume. The goal is to change voiding habits and allow the bladder to carry a more normal volume of urine.\n7. Use an alarm system. In addition to a schedule, set an alarm to help your child remember to go to the bathroom. It can be hard to remember to go to the bathroom every two hours. Because of this, its important to set up an alarm system. When your child is at home or visiting family, such as staying at Grandma's house, set alarm clocks that go off every two hours. You can set these alarms on a smartphone or alarm clock. You can also get your child a watch that beeps or vibrates silently every two hours as a reminder for when she is at school. You may also consider trying a bed-wetting alarm if your child has nighttime incontinence (bed-wetting).\n8. Extend the voiding time. Once you have followed this schedule for four to six weeks, you should extend the voiding time. Normally, you should see improvement within four to six weeks. However, this does not mean you should stop the schedule. You should extend the time so that your child tries to urinate every three or four hours, rather than every two.\n\n\n## Treat urinary tract infections\n\n1. Notice urinary tract infections. You need to pay attention to your child to look for certain causes of incontinence. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are most common in girls who have just started school or have recently been potty trained. In addition to incontinence, UTIs can also cause frequent urination, a burning sensation when she urinates, cloudy or dark colored urine, strong smelling urine, and pain in the lower abdomen. UTIs can be treated with antibiotics. Some children who get frequent UTIs also have a condition called asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). These children, most frequently girls, have bacteria colonizing the bladder, meaning that they reside there, similar to having bacteria quietly living on our skin. This increase in bacteria in the urine can sometimes be the cause of frequent UTIs.\n2. Keep irritation at a minimum. Many kids, particularly girls, will develop irritation and inflammation in the area of the urethral and vaginal openings when they have a UTI. You can use certain creams to help relieve the irritation your child feels. In particular, a zinc oxide-containing skin barrier cream or ointment such as Desitin or Triple Paste can be very helpful. You can purchase these creams at your local pharmacy. Follow the directions on the bottle or box that the cream comes in.\n3. Change your child's clothing when it becomes wet. The bacteria that creates a UTI thrives in moist areas. When your child experiences incontinence and leaks a bit of urine onto her clothes, it's important that she changes into dry clothes to keep her from getting a UTI or to relieve the symptoms of her UTI. This will also keep it from coming back. You can explain this to her so that she does it herself, or you can ask her to tell you when this happens so that you can help her change.\n4. Ask your doctor about antibiotics. If your child has recurrent UTIs, you should talk to the doctor about getting antibiotics to clear up the infection and prevent new infections. Your child's doctor will be able to tell you whether or not antibiotics are the appropriate treatment for your child to prevent infections. Your child will need antibiotics if he has an active UTI. The most common antibiotics used for prophylaxis, or prevention of infections, are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim sulfa. These are usually given once a day, at bedtime, at about \u00bc of the usual full treatment dose given to adults.\n\n\n## Treat constipation\n\n1. Be aware of constipation. Another common cause of incontinence is constipation. When large amounts of stool stays in the body rather than being expelled, it can limit how much room the bladder has to expand and causes the bladder to have unpredictable contractions, both of which cause incontinence. Constipation usually causes infrequent bowel movements for 3 days or more in a row, hard, pebbly stools, very large stools, or pain when moving the bowels.\n2. Have your doctor check your child. If you aren't sure how bad your child's constipation is, have a doctor figure out whether or not your child has a lot of stool backed up in her system. This can be done with the use of X-rays or through a physical examination. Knowing for sure that your child is constipated will help her overcome her incontinence issues.\n3. Ask your child to drink lots of fluids throughout the day. Many kids with urgency and incontinence tend not to drink much fluid, which actually makes their constipation worse. Try to have your child drink at least eight glasses of water each day to stay hydrated. If your child doesn't like drinking plain water, you can give him fruit juices, milk (no more than 2-3 cups a day), and sports drinks.\n4. Increase your child's fiber intake. To help fight constipation, increase your child's daily fiber intake. Fiber is one of the best ways to get your child's bowels working properly. There are plenty of foods that are high in fiber. Try introducing as many foods that are high in fiber as possible into your child's diet. Foods high is fiber include:\n\t* Fresh fruit and vegetables, including raspberries, blueberries, green peas, spinach, collard greens, acorn squash, kale, and broccoli. Whole grain breads with at least three to four grams of fiber per serving. High fiber cereals, such as Raisin Bran, Fiber One, Shredded Wheat, and All Bran. Beans, including black, lima, garbanzo, and pinto beans. Lentils and popcorn are also high in fiber.\n5. Give your child laxatives. Adding fiber-rich food to your child's diet may not be enough. If your child is still having problems, try child-safe laxatives. One laxative that is safe and frequently used is propylene glycol, more commonly known as MiraLax. MiraLax causes water to be transported into the bowel, thereby softening the stool and improving movement. You should check with your child's doctor for guidance before giving MiraLax or other laxatives to your child. Most kids require between \u00bd capfuls and two capfuls per day, and the dose may be adjusted as needed.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned parent or caregiver of a child experiencing urinary incontinence.

You call your hand and say, &quot;I have a Straight!&quot;\nBut that was a bad move on your part because you are a novice player and you did not notice that all of your cards are Spades. You actually had a Straight Flush, but now you have lost because one of the remaining players had a Full House.\nYour hand has not been determined until you call your hand.\n\nIs this true?

That is, when a hand is properly tabled--exposed to everyone at showdown--it is the responsibility of all players, the dealer, floormen, and anyone else present to see that the pot is awarded to the best hand shown, regardless of what the players might say.\n\nSome players object to this rule: they believe that if a player or railbird says \"Wait, Bob has a flush\", that's unfairly helping a player. But the rule is clear: once the hand is tabled, others have not only the right but the obligation to help ensure the pot is awarded correctly.\n\nThere are a couple of caveats: if a player only shows his hand to another player, or to the dealer, or to any other person, without properly tabling it for everyone, that player has no rights yet and those to whom the hand was shown should remain silent to protect other players' properly shown hands. But once the hand is tabled, it's fair game and everyone can and should assist in reading the hands.\n\nFinally, in some cases, if a floorman feels that a player has deliberately overcalled his hand to induce a player with a better hand to fold, he may penalize that player by awarding the pot to someone else, even possibly to a folded hand.

Done in the wrong way, the girl you like might scurry off and never look back. Like all flirting, body language attraction is a fun process, but don\u2019t rush it. Slowly position yourself so that you can flirt with your crush with confidence, and most importantly, have fun with it.\n\n## Get her to warm up to you\n\n1. Get to know her. Think about what she likes and her interests. Ask her if you're not sure. Understanding her interests helps you find common ground so that you have a reason to see and talk to her, which brings you one step closer to physically flirting with her. As you get to know her, be kind and considerate or she might not let you get much closer. Go slow. If you walk up and put your arm around a girl without knowing her well or flirting first, she might get offended and think you\u2019re too forward. Flirting gradually over a period of time -- even if it is a short period of time -- is the best way to get a girl to go out with you.\n2. Compliment her. Compliments give you the ability to let her warm up to you so that you can get close to her physically. When you talk to her, give her a compliment that sounds genuine. Otherwise, she might think you\u2019re trying to \"game\" her. Girls like compliments as long as it doesn\u2019t sound like a pick-up line. Superficial compliments might make her shut down and not want to talk to you. Give compliments that are unique to her and be specific. For instance, compliment her cute ears, freckles or eyes. Remember that a lot of girls -- even the pretty ones -- are very insecure. When you try to compliment her, she might not take you seriously because she thinks you are joking. So, reassure her that you\u2019re not. Don\u2019t neg her or give her a backhanded compliment. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty for a brunette\u201d is not a compliment. Never make her the object of a joke, and if people say something rude -- even if they're teasing -- tell them to stop. Then, quickly glance at her. If her eyes get bigger or if she smiles slightly, then she is impressed and thankful.\n3. Make eye contact when you speak to her. It not only lets her know that you\u2019re listening, but it also gives her the feeling that she is worth your undivided attention. Eye contact creates tension and attraction. Try to hold her gaze for a while without breaking it -- even if there are distractions around. Ignore them. She will be impressed that you didn\u2019t let the chaos around you distract you from her. Then, she\u2019ll be more likely to open up to you.\n4. Mimic her body language. If she leans forward, you lean forward. If she steps to the side, you step to the side. Mimicking her body language is a subtle way of letting her know that you are into her. Even if she is consciously unaware of this, subconsciously she may start to pick up the signal. Watch her body language as well to see if she mimics you. Mimicry is a sign that she is warming up to you even if she is not quite ready for flirtatious touching just yet.\n5. Give her attention in a crowd. Sometimes girls can feel lost when they are standing in a large crowd or even if she is standing amongst friends -- especially if her friends are attractive. She might think that some of her friends get more attention than she does because they are prettier or more outgoing, which means it can be difficult for her to feel like she is being seen and heard. So, make her feel like she is standing out from the others by giving her more attention. When she speaks, pay special attention. Make a point to talk to her directly instead of speaking to others. When the group is making a decision about where to go or what to do, ask her what she thinks the group should do.\n6. Call her just to talk. Make sure that she knows that you really want to get to know her better. Calling her just to chat -- especially since texting is far more popular -- lets her know that you really are interested in getting to know her better. Chat about her interests or current events. Or, just give her a hello and a short chat to let her know you\u2019re thinking about her. You don\u2019t need to be some extreme version of yourself that doesn\u2019t really exist. Just be \u201cnormal.\"\n7. Bring her something. Nothing major. It can be something small like a snack item that you see her eating often. Make sure that you come off like an observant person and not a creepy stalker who likes to watch her. Don't be put off if she refuses your gift. She may not want to immediately accept something from you. She doesn\u2019t want to feel as if she is indebted to you because you gave her something. If you ask a couple of times, she may eventually give in and accept it.\n8. Text her to ask you to meet you somewhere. If she agrees to meet you, don't comment on any other girls or talk about subjects that would make her think you aren't interested-- unless you know she likes those subjects. You don\u2019t want her to think you only like her as a friend. You want to make her feel special, not like just another member of your group\n\n\n## Sneak to touch her\n\n1. Touch her knee against yours. Slowly move your knee toward hers until they touch lightly. Make sure that you touch her knee gently and then linger, so she doesn't think that you are bumping her leg because you need more room for your legs. Flirting by accidental touch helps build attraction because it creates tension. Small touches here and there leaves her wanting more. But remember to keep your eyes open for mutual signals. If it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s enjoying it, stop.\n2. Touch her hand or arm when you laugh. Say something funny, or laugh at her jokes and then laugh. While you\u2019re laughing, gently touch the top of her hand or forearm as if to say \u201c you jokester.\u201d This should look casual and natural. It should look as is if you do this to everyone when you laugh. If you are sitting down when this happens, take this opportunity to casually slide your chair closer to hers.\n3. Tuck her hair behind her ear. This works best if she has a strand of hair out of place or a strand hanging in her face. Gently, tuck the hair behind her ear so that it is out of her face.\n4. Put your hand close to hers. When you are sitting next to her at a table, always place your hand so that it is really close to hers. A finger length apart or a little more is a good distance. To take it a step further, place your hands on hers for just a second as if it is accidental.\n5. Play footsie. If you're sitting at a table/desk across from her, gently put your feet on top of hers. It may seem like playing footsie is a little childish, but it is a way to get a girl\u2019s attention in a playful manner while also letting her know that you\u2019re interested. If she looks under the table and smiles, then she is happy that the person gently kicking her is you.\n\n\n## Flirt with her overtly\n\n1. Hug her. It\u2019s a reason to touch her in a non-sexual way. It\u2019s also a legitimate reason to touch her without seeming too flirty especially if you greet her with a hug. If you do this every time you see her, she will begin to understand that hugging is the way that you greet her.You could possibly get a hug every time you see her. If you want to take it a step further, hug her more frequently. Give her hugs for no reason if you know her fairly well. With time, this may escalate and she might start giving you hugs. However, also keep in mind that some people just don't like hugging. So, it is important to pay attention to her body language and facial expressions. If she doesn't like it, stop; and of course, if she tells you to stop, you should stop immediately.\n2. Play with her hair. Some girls like this. Focus on the hair at the nape of the neck because playing with her hair in this area will probably give her chills -- in a good way. If she is comfortable with you, play with the hair close to her torso or bustline. (Be respectful though.) From there if the girl is still comfortable, take it a little further. With the back of your hand, gently push the hair hanging in front of her shoulders behind her shoulders. (Please don't do this if it looks like the girl worked a long time to style her hair. Even if you are just trying to flirt with her, she will get mad at you for ruining her hair.) If all is well, start to rub her neck like you\u2019re giving her a neck massage.\n3. Put your hands around her waist from behind. If she likes you, she'll most likely lean back on you. Touch her gently so you don't startle her. If you two get really comfortable she might even let you slide your hand down a little lower. Once she\u2019s comfortable with you putting your hands on her waist, grab her and swing her around. Then, she\u2019ll be facing you. Lean in and whisper something in her ear, or just say it outright. You\u2019ll be able to tell if she liked it by the expression on her face. (Beware: Some girls are extremely ticklish and tend to involuntarily squeal or giggle when someone touches their waists).\n4. Push her playfully. When you're walking next to her on a sidewalk or path, gently push her off the path. She'll probably push you back, which will start some playful flirting. Because even childishly pushing each other is a way of flirting. (Don't do this on a busy road though. Someone might get hurt.)\n5. Put your head in her lap. If you're already friends and you're watching a movie, reading, or just talking with friends, go over and lie your head in her lap. Let her play with your hair. If she pushes you off, just laugh. This only works well if you\u2019ve flirted with this girl many times before.\n6. Tickle her. Good areas for tickling are under her ribs or the sides or her stomach. If she likes you, she'll tickle you back -- probably while smiling or laughing. Watch her signals though, if she doesn't like it or if she pulls away, stop. You don\u2019t want to annoy her and ruin any chances of getting close to her again. If she pulls away, revert back to the physical touching that she seems to be comfortable with and do that for a while.\n7. Be respectful. Pay attention to her body language and anything that she says. You don't want to overstep her boundaries. Overt touching should be consensual, and some people are uncomfortable with public displays of affection or being touched at all. Everyone is different, so it is very important to pay attention to her verbal and non-verbal cues. If she says, \"stop\" at any point, then stop. If she looks uncomfortable, stop. She'll perceive you as invading her space and possibly harassing her. Neither are attractive or respectful.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A young adult, possibly male, who is interested in dating and seeking advice on how to approach and flirt with women in a physical manner.

{"conversations": ["How to change a chain on a mountain bike?", "No matter how cheap or expensive your bicycle is, there will come a day when you need to fix or replace its chain. The structure of a mountain bike may be more complex than the structure of a regular bike, but the chain changing process is similar. With the right tools and a little bit of patience, you'll have a new chain on your bike in no time.\n\n## Remove the chain\n\n1. Secure your bike. It's unlikely that your kickstand will be sufficient for you to get a good look at your bike without it falling over. A bike rack that has hooks from which you can hang your bike works very well, but you can also turn your bike upside down so it rests on the seat and handlebars. Inspecting your chain with your bike's wheels facing upwards will make it more comfortable for you to inspect and work on. If you don't have a rack, simply lean your bike upright against a wall.\n2. Take a picture of the chain. To make the reinstallation process easier, take a picture of the chain so you can refer to it later. Make sure your picture shows how the chain feeds through the gear mechanism.\n3. Check for a master link. A master link is a special link in your bike chain that has a pin/slot configuration that will allow you to easily remove your chain from the bike. Two popular kinds of master links are Connex and SRAM Powerlink. Knowing where your master link is ahead of time will make chain replacement go smoother. The master link for a bike is specific to the chain size and brand. If your bike does not have a master link, you can install one yourself or have it done at your local bike shop. This installation is usually inexpensive, costing about $15 in most cases. If your bike does not have a master link and you prefer not to have one installed, order a chain-tool to remove the chain. They're inexpensive and essential pieces of equipment.\n4. Position your chain. This is especially important if you have a master link. Removing a master link that's positioned on the teeth of the chain ring or a gear can be very difficult. Positioning the master link so it is suspended at the midpoint between the crankset and the rear wheel will be easiest. If you are using a chain tool, you can still benefit from proper chain positioning. Some parts of your chain will be dirtier or have more wear than others. A clear segment of chain positioned at the midpoint between the wheels will be easiest to remove with your chain tool.\n5. Remove the chain. Now that the chain is in position, you can remove it. If you have a master link, use master-link pliers or your hands to squeeze both ends of the master link inwards so the pin comes out of its slot and the link comes apart, freeing your chain. If you're using a chain tool:\n\t* Set the chain tool on the link you are trying to remove so it aligns with one of the round holes to either side of the link. Screw the chain tool so it moves through the hole. This will push out the pin that is keeping that link together. Try not to push the pin completely free of the link. This will make it difficult, or in some cases impossible, to reassemble that link of the chain. You'll often feel a popping or snapping when the pin pushes free of the link. This is a good indicator that the link has been disengaged. Some chain tools are only intended for certain sized links, though some can be used on several different sizes of chain. Check the instructions on your chain tool before using it.\n\n\n## Attach your new chain\n\n1. Avoid using failed chains as replacements. Chains generally fail because they have reached their limit or been put under too much stress. Replacing a failed chain on your bike could result in an even more severe failure down the road. To prevent injury to yourself or your mountain bike, you should buy a new chain instead of reusing old ones. Bike chains can be bought at your local bike shop or, in some cases, your local hardware store.\n2. Measure your replacement chain. It's important that you only use the kind of chain intended for your bike. For example, an 11-speed bike will use an 11-speed chain. Hang your old bike chain so it dangles freely and do the same with your new chain beside the old one. Count the number of links if your new chain is longer than the old. This will be the number of links you need to remove. If your chain has snapped and it is unreliable to measure your new chain, you can remove links after feeding the chain into the drivetrain of your bike.\n3. Insert your chain into the gear mechanism. For more complex mountain bike, you may need to consult the picture you took of how the old chain feeds through the gear mechanism to do this properly. Simple mechanisms may be more intuitive. Pull the chain through the entire drivetrain until both ends terminate at the bottom midpoint between your wheels. Positioning the ends of your chain at the bottom midpoint between the wheels of your bike will make it more accessible and allow gravity to keep the chain on the bike until you can secure it.\n4. Remove extra links from the chain, if necessary. If your chain is loose, you'll need to remove some links. This is likely the case if you were not able to measure your chain. Shift your bike to its lowest gear, and then use your chain tool to remove links one at a time to shorten the chain until it is taut in the drivetrain. When removing extra links, avoid popping the pin holding them together completely free of the link. This will make it difficult to reattach the link if you shorten it too much. For the best ride, you'll need the chain to be strung tautly between the wheels in its lowest gear.\n5. Attach the loose ends of your chain. With a master link, all you need to do is slip the pin of the link into its slot to complete the link. If you removed your chain with a chain tool, you'll have to re-couple the split link by lining up its halves together and using a pair of pliers to force the pin back through the hole to complete the link. You should feel a click or a pop when the pin of a master link slides into place. You can also pull on the chain to either side of the link to securely seat the pin of the master link in place.\n6. Test your chain. Reposition your bike back on its rack and move the pedals manually with your hands to run the chain through the drivetrain of your bicycle. The chain should move smoothly. If you notice stiff links, these are often caused by a protruding link pin, and can be fixed by resetting the pin with your chain tool and pliers. Cycle the suspension by sitting on the saddle and bouncing up and down a few times to test your chain length. To protect your chain from the elements and to help it run smoothly in your drive train, you should lubricate your chain with a suitable bicycle chain lubricant.\n\n\n## Inspect your chain for wear\n\n1. Use a chain wear indicator to evaluate your chain for best results. You can find a chain wear indicator at your local bike shop or maybe even at a hardware store. You'll have to attach the indicator between the links of your chain and follow the directions on it to interpret its reading. Most chain wear indicators will have a sticker that establishes the values for a worn chain and an unworn chain. If your wear indicator does not, check the box it came in for these values. If you do not have a wear indicator, you can perform a hand check of the chain. Use moderate pressure to lift a section of your chain from the chainring of your bike with your fingers. A small gap should form between the chain and the ring. If you can clearly see through the gap over three or four teeth, your chain is worn.\n2. Try to join the ends of your chain to test for wear as a simpler alternative. If inspecting your chain with a wear indicator or a physical gap check aren't an option, or if your chain is already off the bike, you can also check for wear by trying to touch the ends of the bike chain. Lay your chain on a clean surface so that the holes in the chain are oriented up and down. Then:\n\t* Try to touch the ends of the chain together while keeping the holes facing up and down. Over time, chains are bent by the action of your bikes derailleur. Note the amount of sideways flex in your chain. A worn chain will have a great deal flexion. Newer chains resist touching and only arc slightly.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the drivetrain. The drivetrain of your bike is the part that transfers the energy you put into the pedals through the chain to your gears to move the wheels. You'll want to pay extra close attention to how the chain feeds into the gears. Knowing how the chain fits in the mechanism will allow you to replace it with greater ease.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A cycling enthusiast or a bike mechanic with experience in repairing and maintaining mountain bikes.

{"conversations": ["Traditional advice for making megadungeons in older versions of D&D is in addition to any rooms with Monsters, Treasure, Traps, or \"Tricks\", there should also be at least 50 to 60 percent \"Empty\" rooms, which contain nothing overtly threatening or valuable.  Now, there's several arguments for including these empty rooms that I buy, so I'm not going to accept any answer which primarily says, \"Don't include empty rooms\".  The main issue I run into with empty rooms, however, is that they're boring in the way that I've been including them.  They don't do their job of increasing tension, and the set dressing included around them hasn't been sufficiently interesting to my players either.  My question is this: How can I make empty rooms interesting, by increasing tension or simply being interesting in and of themselves?", "By definition, nothing's going to happen in an empty room (though see below). There are no hidden doors to find, no puzzles to solve, no enemies to fight. So what's their purpose?\n\n## Bringing the dungeon to life\nWhile all the orcs may sit around in a guard room waiting for PCs to show up, where do they sleep, what do they eat, what happens to their trash? Think of a dungeon not just as a place to have fights in, but as an actual place that serves a purpose. Once you do, the dungeon will start making sense. &quot;Empty&quot; rooms will increase immersion for the players, and force you to consider things you may not have otherwise. Should there be a pet otyugh that eats the trash? Are the orcs demanding cows from the local farmers for &quot;protection&quot;? Do they keep a famed halfling cook enslaved, to make them rare steaks?\n\n## Foreshadowing\nOnce the dungeon makes sense, you can use that to place clues for things that dwell deeper within. Has a horde of zombies marched through to guard the necromancer's abode within, and left a few rotten body parts here and there? Has a malevolent force been summoned and spoiled all the meat and milk in the dungeon? Is there a golem maintenance station, with oil to grease them, rags to polish them, and a mad goblin mechanic? These may be vital clues PCs need to prepare for a tough fight, or they can simply let them form theories and feel smart about being right once they do come upon a golem or three.\n\n#Currently empty\nThese rooms are empty now, but they don't have to stay that way. PCs may choose to fortify a room and bring the enemy to them - such tactical choices could be an important part of dungeoncrawling. Orcs may chase PCs through the dungeon, or randomly come across them in a kitchen because they were feeling peckish.\nNote that some of these ideas would introduce creatures or things into rooms that PCs may choose to interact with, which would make them non-empty. In a way that's fine: you started with an empty room but found something interesting to put inside after all. If that's not your intention, well, don't put goblins or halflings or otyughs in.

Fleeing from cannibals, Ning winds up being imprisoned. Sharing a cell with Elder Chu, a renowned scholar, Ning spends apparent months languishing in prison. On the day of Ning's execution, the scholar reveals that he has dug out an escape tunnel. He gives Ning one of his books and a pendant, and sends Ning through the tunnel. Ning obliviously steals the horse of Autumn (Jacky Cheung), a Taoist sectarian. When Ning stops for the night in an abandoned villa, Autumn catches up and the two sort out the misunderstanding. But in the middle of the night, rebel soldiers attack the two visitors. After a short skirmish, the rebel sisters Windy (Joey Wong) and Moon (Michelle Reis) discover Elder Chu's pendant. While Ning mistakes Windy for his love Siu Sin, whom she resembles, the rebels mistake Ning for the Elder Chu. The sisters explain that their father, Lord Fu (Lau Siu-Ming), was framed for a crime and is now being transported to the place of his execution. The rebels' mission is to free him. They set off and leave Ning and Autumn at the villa. The next night, the two discover that the villa actually is haunted by a demon. Autumn manages to injure it, but it flees. He gives pursuit, but without success. He emerges at daybreak on a dirt road, causing an altercation with an imperial convoy led by Fu (Waise Lee). Fu and Autumn battle to a stalemate, and then go their separate ways. Unbeknownst to Autumn, the convoy is the one carrying the sisters' father. Having failed to catch the convoy earlier, the rebels return to the haunted villa, waiting to ambush the convoy there. As the convoy enters, however, the demon returns as well. Maneuvering Fu into fighting the demon, the rebels are able to rescue the sisters' father. Before long, however, the Imperial High Monk arrives with his entourage. He incapacitates the rebels with a spell, which Autumn recognizes as an evil chant. Ning and Windy escape to seek the help of Yin, while Lord Fu, Autumn and Moon are captured by the monk. The captives are brought back to the High Monk's palace. Now suspicious, Fu enters the palace only to find the hollow corpses of the entire royal court inside. Recognizing that the monk is in reality a demon, Fu frees the captives and fights valiantly by himself to allow them time to recover. Lacking spiritual magic, however, Fu is not able to overcome the demon and is destroyed. Just then, Yin and the others arrive. The demon is forced to reveal its true form, a gigantic thousand-year-old centipede. Yin and Autumn are swallowed by the creature, and they separate their souls from their bodies in order to destroy it from the inside. Autumn, however, is not able to return to his body, and his soul floats away. The next day is the marriage of Windy to the Ma family. Ning runs down from his inn to the main street and tells Moon that he wishes Windy a long, happy marriage before leaving.

{"conversations": ["How to cook corn?", "There are many different yet simple ways to cook corn. Corn on the cob can be boiled, microwaved, grilled, steamed, or baked, while loose kernel corn is usually boiled, steamed, or microwaved. Keep reading to learn more about your preferred cooking method.\n\n## Boiling corn on the cob[1]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Boil a large stockpot of water. Meanwhile, prepare the corn cobs by removing the husks and silks. The exact amount of water you need will vary depending on how large each ear of corn is. Make sure that you use enough water to completely cover the ears of corn once they are submerged. Note that you can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) salt to the water if desired, but it is not needed. To remove the husks, snap off the stem of the corn with your hands. Pull the stem over the length of the corn to peel off the husks still attached to it. Remove the remaining husks by peeling them off with your fingers. Rinse the husk-free corn cobs under running water. Rub your hands over the corn to loose and free as many of the silky threads you spot clinging to the corn.\n2. Transfer the corn to the boiling water. Cover the pot and let it return to boiling. Use tongs to dunk the corn into the water. Avoid using your hands to transfer the corn since doing so may result in burns. If the boiling slows or stops after you place the corn in the stockpot, allow the water to reach a boiling point again before timing the cooking process.\n3. Cook for 3 to 8 minutes. The corn should be \"tender-crisp\" when done. \"Tender-crisp\" means that the corn is soft enough to press, but not mushy. The precise amount of cooking time will vary based on the type of corn and how mature it is. Fresh corn and sweet corn usually cook fastest.\n4. Remove and serve. Transfer the ears of corn to a layer of clean paper towels and let drain for 30 to 60 seconds before serving. The corn will be hot, so you may want to wait a few minutes before biting into it. Corn is usually served with a drizzle of butter.\n\n\n## Microwaving corn on the cob[2]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Place an ear of corn in a microwave-safe dish. You will need to cook the corn one ear at a time, but the instructions are the same for each ear. Do not remove the husk. The corn will cook better in the microwave if left in the husk during the cooking process.\n2. Microwave the corn for 5 minutes. The microwave should be set on high power or full power. Let stand in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes to avoid burning yourself with the steam.\n3. Transfer the corn to a cutting board. Cut of the stem end using a sharp kitchen knife. Use oven mitts or a towel when removing the corn from the microwave. As you cut, you should also remove the first row of kernels. Make sure to cut through the husk completely.\n4. Slip the corn out of its husk and serve. Use oven mitts or a towel to grab hold of the corn from the uncut top end. Gently shake the ear, allowing the corn to slip free. The ear of corn should slip out of the husk easily. Usually, even the silks will remain left behind inside the husks. You can serve the corn with butter and salt, or however you prefer it.\n\n\n## Grilling corn on the cob\n\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Meanwhile, remove the husks and silks from your ears of corn. If using a gas grill, set all the burners to medium-high heat and allow the grill to preheat for 5 to 10 minutes. If using a charcoal grill, allow a thick layer of coals to burn until white ash begins to form over the surface. Husk the corn by snapping off the stem and pulling it over the length of the corn, thereby removing the husk attached to the stem. Peel away the rest of the husk with your fingers. Rinse the ears under running water to remove most of the loose silks.\n2. Brush the corn with olive oil. Use a basting brush to apply a thin coat of olive oil to the surface of each ear of corn. Use no more than 1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil per ear. You could also use melted butter instead of olive oil.\n3. Transfer the corn to the grill. Cook for 6 to 10 minutes. Turn the corn occasionally to ensure even cooking and prevent burning. The corn is done once the majority of the kernels begin to brown lightly. It will also be charred in some spots, especially near the smaller kernels.\n4. Serve as desired. Remove the corn from the grill and transfer each ear to a serving platter. Let cool until you can handle it comfortably with your bare hands. Butter and salt are frequently served with corn, but if you used butter on the corn before grilling it, you may find that you do not need to add more.\n\n\n## Steaming corn on the cob[3]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Boil water in the bottom portion of a steamer. Husk and de-silk the ears of corn as you wait. If you do not have an actual steamer, you can use a large stockpot and perforated metal colander instead. Make sure that the metal colander can rest on the lip of the stockpot before attempting to use it, however. The basket portion of the colander should not dip below the halfway point of the stockpot. Snap off the stem of the corn and pull it over the length of the ear, removing the attached husk. Peel the rest of the husk away with your fingers. Rinse the corn under cool running water, scrubbing it gently with your hands. This should remove the majority of the silks.\n2. Transfer the corn to the steaming basket. Cook for 8 to 12 minutes. Use tongs to transfer the corn into the steaming basket. Using your hands could result in burns. The exact cooking time will vary depending on how mature the corn is. Fresher corn cooks quicker than older corn. The corn is done once the kernels feel tender but not mushy.\n3. Serve warm. Remove the corn from the steamer with your tongs and let rest for a minute or two before enjoying. Season with butter and salt, if desired.\n\n\n## Baking corn on the cob[4]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius). Remove the husks and silks from each ear of corn as the oven preheats. To remove the husk from an ear of corn, snap off the stem using your hands. Pull the broken stem down over the ear, stripping away any husk attached to it. Peel the rest of the exposed husk away with your fingers. Rinse each corn cob under running water, scrubbing gently with your hands to remove any visible silks. Pat dry with paper towels.\n2. Season the ears with butter. You can also add a little salt and pepper, if desired. Use plenty of butter. Spread at least 1 to 2 Tbsp of melted butter over each ear.\n3. Wrap each ear in aluminum foil. Each ear must be completely wrapped inside its own sheet of aluminum foil. If you are worried about butter leaking out from the aluminum foil, place a flat baking sheet or jelly-roll pan beneath the wrapped ears of corn to catch any dripping butter.\n4. Bake the corn for 20 to 30 minutes. Most ears of corn will only take 20 minutes to cook, but larger ears may need as many as 30 minutes. Place the corn on the middle rack of your oven to ensure the most even cooking.\n5. Remove and serve. Let the cooked ears of corn rest for 2 to 5 minutes before carefully removing the aluminum foil. Serve once they are cool enough to touch.\n\n\n## Boiling corn kernels\n\n1. Boil water in a medium saucepan. Meanwhile, measure out your frozen whole corn kernels. You can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) of salt to the boiling water, if desired, but the salt is not necessary. The corn does not need to be thawed prior to use. You could also use canned corn kernels instead of frozen corn. Note that the amount of time needed to boil canned corn is significantly less than the amount of time needed to boil frozen corn. Additionally, canned corn should be drained before you add it to the boiling water.\n2. Add the corn to the boiling water. If the boiling decreases or stops, let the water come up to a boil again. After it returns to a rolling boil, reduce the heat to medium-low.\n3. Cover and cook. Frozen whole kernels of corn should simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain once finished. Canned corn should only boil for 1 to 3 minutes. Once finished, the corn should be hot and tender but not mushy.\n4. Serve as desired. Do not refreeze corn kernels after cooking them. If desired, you can mix the cooked corn kernels with butter, salt, and black pepper. You can also use other seasonings, like parsley, according to your own tastes.\n\n\n## Steaming corn kernels\n\n1. Simmer water in a steamer. Fill the lower part of a steamer with water and heat, on the stove, over medium heat until the water steams and starts to simmer. Do not boil the water. Do not fill the steamer high enough for water to slip up through the holes of the steamer basket. If you do not have a steamer, you could use a stockpot and a metal colander with fine holes. Make sure that the colander fits over the lip of the stockpot without falling in.\n2. Add frozen corn kernels into the steamer basket. Spread the kernels out into a single layer. Canned corn kernels can also be used, but they will finish cooking in a much shorter amount of time. They may also be soggier once finished. You do not need to thaw frozen corn kernels before use.\n3. Cook for 9 to 10 minutes. Allow the corn to steam for 9 to 10 minutes without covering it. Drain once finished. Canned kernels will only need to steam for 3 or 4 minutes.\n4. Serve. Steamed corn can be served with butter and salt as well as other seasonings.\n\n\n## Microwaving corn kernels\n\n1. Place corn kernels in a microwave-safe dish. Spread frozen corn kernels into an even layer in the dish. Canned corn kernels can also be used, but there are some differences in the cooking method and length. Frozen corn does not need to be thawed prior to cooking.\n2. Add 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 mL) of water. Stir the water into the corn to disperse it throughout. Note that this step is only needed if using frozen corn kernels. You do not need to add water if using canned corn, but you should not drain the canned corn before use.\n3. Cover the dish with plastic wrap. Use a fork to poke a few holes into the plastic wrap, providing ventilation. Only use plastic wrap that is safe to use in the microwave. If the dish has a cover, you could use that instead of the plastic wrap. Make sure that the cover is placed on the dish loosely so that the corn is still ventilated.\n4. Microwave for 4 to 5 minutes. If using canned corn, only microwave the dish for 1 to 2 minutes. The exact length of time varies depending on how much wattage your microwave has. A lower-powered microwave will need longer time, while a higher-powered microwave will need less time. If you hear popping sounds as the corn cooks, stop the microwave early.\n5. Drain and serve. Drain the cooking liquid from the corn and season as desired with butter, salt, and pepper.\n\n\n## Charcoal grilled corn on the cob\n\n1. Cut the tip of each ear of corn off. Soak the corn in the husks in a sink or a big pot in 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) of tap water for about an hour.\n2. While they're soaking, prepare your outdoor charcoal grill. Add enough coals for an hour of cooking.\n3. Place the corn still in the husks on the grill. Cook for about an hour, turning occasionally, allowing the husks to char.\n4. Remove the husks.\n5. Add butter, salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A curious home cook or a beginner in the kitchen who is seeking guidance on preparing corn dishes.

I imagine that in math research, one has more control/ownership of their work, there's no lab to be a part of and contribute to, one's funding is typically in the form of teaching stipends, and the meetings are typically one-on-one, with no group meetings to attend.\nIs a math PhD a better experience than a science PhD, in the sense that there is significantly less risk of working for a problematic, unethical, malicious scientist/professor who only cares about himself/herself?", "First, please keep in mind that the number of questions on the public forum doesn't give any indication of how common such issues are, since people usually only post when something is wrong. We don't hear about all the cases where everything is fine. It is unclear why math advisors should inherently be better people than in any other field, and there is no empirical evidence that warrants this. However, a few of the specific issues you mention are perhaps less likely to arise in mathematics, due to cultural and structural reasons.\n\n>\"my advisor has stopped funding me\"\n\nIn the US, at least, the main avenue of funding for math graduate students is through teaching assistantships, since math departments teach a large number of service courses. Faculty who have grants can sometimes offer their students a research assistantship instead, so that the student doesn't have to teach. But a student really isn't completely reliant on their advisor for funding. Moreover, there typically aren't major expenses for the research itself (no expensive equipment, etc), so as long as the student is getting paid, research can continue.\n(This is not necessarily the case in other countries.)\n\n>\"my advisor wants to be 1st author, when I did the majority of the work!\"\n\nThe general practice in mathematics is that all authors are listed alphabetically, and the concept of \"first authorship\" does not exist. As such, people don't bother to keep track of who did the \"majority\" of the work. Thus this particular issue doesn't arise in mathematics.\n\n>\"my advisor is stealing my ideas!\"\n\nWhile individual departments may vary, I think there's a general sense in mathematics that a joint paper \"counts\" about the same as a solo paper. As such, if a student has contributed to a project, the advisor has no particular incentive not to include them as an author on the paper.\n\n>\"my advisor wants to add another student to the paper and this is unfair!\"\n\nAs above, it isn't any particular disadvantageous to a student if another student is added.", "I agree with most of this, except that in mathematics I think a joint paper *published by a student with their thesis advisor* is usually worth distinctly less than a solo paper by the student -- within the standard culture of mathematics, the former indicates an unusual amount of help. In my experience, it is more common for this to be violated *in favor of the student*, so that e.g. certain solo papers arising from student theses were largely told to the student by their eminent advisor. Our community seems bad at recognizing that there are still victims here...just not the student.", "You're right that within the standard culture of mathematics, a joint paper published by a student with their thesis advisor may be perceived as having less value compared to a solo paper by the student. This is due to the implicit understanding that the advisor has provided substantial assistance. It is disheartening to hear that there are cases where this norm is violated, and certain thesis papers shaped by the advisor end up being published as solo student papers.

Read a book, have a glass of milk, do some yoga, or do some light stretching.\n* Avoid eating heavy meals right before bed.\n* Get exposure to bright light (sunlight or a bright light box) in the morning.\n\nIf none of these techniques help you sleep, or if you have trouble sleeping for more than a few weeks, you should see a doctor.  Insomnia can be a symptom of a serious underlying medical condition, and you should get it checked out."], "source": "authors", "questioner": "an individual experiencing chronic insomnia, seeking practical advice to improve their sleep quality and overall well-being.

{"conversations": ["Why is Gaia operating around Earth orbit? Why not send it to Neptune's orbit?", "Well, you thought about the spatial aspect of a parallax measurement, but not about the temporal one.\nGaia's intention is to measure 3D positions as well as 3D velocities. For the distance, you need accurate parallactic measurement, which come in with your orbital period.\nFor a typical Gaia-star with several measurement per year, you'll get 5 values of the parallax after 5 years of time, which you then average. If you'd send Gaia towards Neptune (besides the fact that no one has ever sent an orbiter, to say nothing of a L2 mission that far out) that has a period of 168 years, then after 5 years you'd get... 5/168 th of one paralactic measurement.\nIt simply couldn't achieve its science goals if put around the L2 behind Neptune. Also no one on this planet has any experience in putting something into a outer system L2 point. This is different than putting it into Earth's L2, because reaching the L2 around one of the giants has vast and very precise $\\Delta v$ requirements. This would be a massive technological leap, and things don't work that way in space. Small, incremental technological steps are required in an anyways unfriendly environment, to make sure everything works properly and no millions of dollars have been wasted.\nCompare that to Gaia's predecessor, the Hipparcos satellite, which was parked in geostationary orbit.\nNow you could still say, why not use Jupiter hypothetically anyways. Well, the orbital period there is still 11 years, and Jupiter's L2 still suffers from the intense radiation environment that is provided by Jupiter's magnetosphere. This would lead to rapid degradation of the CCDs used for scanning across the sky."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "an astrophysicist, space scientist, or space enthusiast with a keen interest in the Gaia mission.
