{"conversations": ["In Dupire's local volatility model, the volatility is is a deterministic function of the underlying price and time, chosen to match observed European option prices.\nTo be more specific, given a smooth surface $(K,T)\\mapsto C(K,T)$ where K is the strike and T is time to maturity. Dupire equation implies that there exits an unique continuous function $\\sigma_{loc}$ defined by\n$$\\sigma_{loc}^{2}(K,T)=\\frac{\\partial_{T}C(K,T)+rK\\partial_{K}C(K,T)}{\\frac{1}{2}K^{2}\\partial_{KK}C(K,T)}$$ for all $(K,T)\\in(0,\\infty)\\times(0,\\infty)$ such that the solution to the stochastic differential equation $dS_{t}/S_{t}=rdt+\\sigma(t,S_{t})dW_{t}$ exactly generates the European call option prices.\nWhat do the dynamics of the local volatility mean? Are dynamics equivalent to the volatility surface? Why the dynamics of local volatility model is highly unrealistic?", "A general model (with continuous paths) can be written\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r_t dt + \\sigma_t dW_t^S\n$$\nwhere the short rate $r_t$ and spot volatility $\\sigma_t$ are stochastic processes. \nIn the Black-Scholes model both $r$ and $\\sigma$ are deterministic functions of time (even constant in the original model). This produces a flat smile for any expiry $T$. And we have the closed form formula for option prices\n$$\n  C(t,S;T,K) = BS(S,T-t,K;\\Sigma(T,K))\n$$\nwhere $BS$ is the BS formula and $\\Sigma(T,K) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T-t}\\int_t^T \\sigma(s)^2 ds}$. This is not consistent with the smile observed on the market. In order to match market prices, one needs to use a different volatility for each expiry and strike. This is the implied volatility surface $(T,K) \\mapsto \\Sigma(T,K)$. \nIn the local volatility model, rates are deterministic, instant volatility is stochastic but there is only one source of randomness\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r(t) dt + \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) dW_t^S\n$$\nthis is a special case of the general model with\n$$\n  d\\sigma_t = (\\partial_t \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + r(t)S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + \\frac{1}{2}S_t^2\\partial_S^2\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)) dt + \\frac{1}{2}S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)^2 dW_t^S\n$$\nWhat is appealing with this model is that the function $\\sigma_{Dup}$ can be perfectly calibrated to match all market vanilla prices (and quite easily too). \nThe problem is that while correlated to the spot, statistical study show that the volatility also has its own source of randomness independent of that of the spot. Mathematically, this means the instant correlation between the spot and vol is not 1 contrary to what happens in the local volatility model. \nThis can be seen in several ways:\n\n1. The forward smile. Forward implied volatility is implied from prices of forward start options: ignoring interest rates,\n$$\n  C(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K) := E^Q[(\\frac{S_{T+\\theta}}{S_{T}}-K)_+] =: C_{BS}(S=1,\\theta,K;\\Sigma(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K))\n$$\nAlternatively, it is sometimes defined as the expectation of implied volatility at a forward date. In a LV model, as the maturity $T$ increases but $\\theta$ is kept constant, the forward smile gets flatter and higher. This is not what we observe in the markets where the forward smile tends to be similar to the current smile.\n\nThis is because the initial smile you calibrate the model too has decreasing skew:\n$$\n\\partial_K \\Sigma(0,S;T,K) \\xrightarrow[T\\to +\\infty]{} 0\n$$ \n\n2. Smile rolling. In a LV model, smile tends to move in the opposite direction of the spot and get higher independently of the direction of the spot.\nThis is not consistent with what is observed on markets. See Hagan and al. Managing Smile Risk for the derivation. This means that\n$\\partial_S \\Sigma_{LV}(t,S;T,K)$ often has the wrong sign so your Delta will be wrong which can lead to a higher hedging error than using BS. \n3. Barrier options. In FX markets, barrier options like Double No Touch are liquid but a LV model calibrated to vanilla prices does not reproduce these prices. This is a consequence of the previous point.   \n\nThe LV model is a static model. Its whole dynamic comes from the volatility surface at time 0. But the vol surface has a dynamic that is richer than that.\nThere are alternatives using multiple factors like SV models, LSV models (parametric local vol like SABR or fully non parametric local vol), models of the joint dynamic of the spot and vol surface etc... but the LV model remains the default model in many cases due to its simplicity, its ability to calibrate the initial smile perfectly and its numerical efficiency.

Can those restrictions follow us after clocking out? ", "In general, employers in the United States are free to fire you for your speech. The First Amendment does not apply to anyone except the government (other than a narrow set of circumstances where private parties act on behalf of the government or take on government roles, like when private universities employ campus police). If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question -- the answer would clearly be \"no, there is no First Amendment claim here.\" That\u2019s not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment.\nWhat makes this interesting is that the government is involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In Pickering v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can't necessarily fire an employee for speech. Pickering imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee's First Amendment rights is weighed against the government's interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see Pappas v. Giuliani, where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off-duty time.\nAnother answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that's not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job requires maintaining good relations with the community. In Pappas, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A person who values individual rights and freedom of speech, and questions the extent to which an employer can regulate an employee's personal life, particularly when it comes to speech and expression.

I imagine that in math research, one has more control/ownership of their work, there's no lab to be a part of and contribute to, one's funding is typically in the form of teaching stipends, and the meetings are typically one-on-one, with no group meetings to attend.\nIs a math PhD a better experience than a science PhD, in the sense that there is significantly less risk of working for a problematic, unethical, malicious scientist/professor who only cares about himself/herself?", "First, please keep in mind that the number of questions on the public forum doesn't give any indication of how common such issues are, since people usually only post when something is wrong. We don't hear about all the cases where everything is fine. It is unclear why math advisors should inherently be better people than in any other field, and there is no empirical evidence that warrants this. However, a few of the specific issues you mention are perhaps less likely to arise in mathematics, due to cultural and structural reasons.\n\n>\"my advisor has stopped funding me\"\n\nIn the US, at least, the main avenue of funding for math graduate students is through teaching assistantships, since math departments teach a large number of service courses. Faculty who have grants can sometimes offer their students a research assistantship instead, so that the student doesn't have to teach. But a student really isn't completely reliant on their advisor for funding. Moreover, there typically aren't major expenses for the research itself (no expensive equipment, etc), so as long as the student is getting paid, research can continue.\n(This is not necessarily the case in other countries.)\n\n>\"my advisor wants to be 1st author, when I did the majority of the work!\"\n\nThe general practice in mathematics is that all authors are listed alphabetically, and the concept of \"first authorship\" does not exist. As such, people don't bother to keep track of who did the \"majority\" of the work. Thus this particular issue doesn't arise in mathematics.\n\n>\"my advisor is stealing my ideas!\"\n\nWhile individual departments may vary, I think there's a general sense in mathematics that a joint paper \"counts\" about the same as a solo paper. As such, if a student has contributed to a project, the advisor has no particular incentive not to include them as an author on the paper.\n\n>\"my advisor wants to add another student to the paper and this is unfair!\"\n\nAs above, it isn't any particular disadvantageous to a student if another student is added.", "I agree with most of this, except that in mathematics I think a joint paper *published by a student with their thesis advisor* is usually worth distinctly less than a solo paper by the student -- within the standard culture of mathematics, the former indicates an unusual amount of help. In my experience, it is more common for this to be violated *in favor of the student*, so that e.g. certain solo papers arising from student theses were largely told to the student by their eminent advisor. Our community seems bad at recognizing that there are still victims here...just not the student.", "You're right that within the standard culture of mathematics, a joint paper published by a student with their thesis advisor may be perceived as having less value compared to a solo paper by the student. This is due to the implicit understanding that the advisor has provided substantial assistance.

At some point the students know perfectly how to use these two functions but they don't know about <code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code> and <code>argv</code>. \nTo me and according to many programming principles (e.g. KISS) a program should not interrupt the execution for prompting the user. Instead, and this is a much clever approach, the developer should learn to use the power of pipes and use the options and the arguments. \nI think this:\n<code>$ whatdaywas 1982 02 16\nMonday\n</code>\nIs much better than: \n<code>$ whatdaywas\nEnter a year: 1982\nEnter a month: 2\nEnter a day: 16\nIt was a Monday.\n</code>\nIs there any rationale behind this pedagogical approach?", "When tutoring young CS students, user input is actually a tricky concept. If it were not for user input, the results of any program could be pre-compiled into nothing but its output. You get one lesson from getting all the input right at the beginning, with argc/argv, but from that point on, its just the computer churning. You get a different lesson from getting input during the execution of the program.\n\nThe idea of getting input from the user is surprisingly non-intuitive, given that nearly every program we interact with on a daily basis does it. This suggests that introducing it early helps prune misconceptions about how computers work before they become a real problem.\n\nObviously not every student is the same, but a particular pattern is that they can understand what a program should do when it executes but not how that actually happens. They can look at\n<code>BOOL x = TRUE;\nif (x)\n    printf(\"Hello\\n\");\nelse\n    printf(\"World\\n\");\n</code>\nAnd they can intuit that the program should print \"Hello\", but they can't intuit how a computer can possibly do so. Students are often told to figure the compiler does the \"magic,\" and figure out which printf to use (let's ignore optimizers for a moment).\nHowever, when the values come from input, you can no longer think about the computer as a magic device which reaches the final result immediately. You have to see that it is following steps. We know this, but it seems many students don't grasp this at first.\nIf you have inputs coming from `argv`, its easier to keep this illusion going. If you have input during the program, after the program has already done something, you have to realize what's going on quicker.  In particular, it gets you closer to the point of realizing that the input the computer asks for may vary based on previous inputs (press 1 to calculate the area of a circle, press 2 to calculate the area of a rectangle.  Depending on the next scanf/gets, the computer will ask for one additional number or two).", "Could you elaborate on the unintuitive bit?

Bedrooms? No, they're kitchen appliances and GFCIs are widely used in kitchens. GFCIs are code requirements and have been for ~20 years. If they are unable to make a GFCI-compatible machine, then their machine is unfit for purpose, and they have breached their implied warranty.

Such a claim is both nonsensical and inexcusable, and is certainly not coming from their technical department, nor has it been reviewed by their legal team, nor will you ever get them to put that in writing.  Most likely it is because companies put tremendous pressure on customer service agents to have a high rate of good ratings, &quot;close it in 1 call&quot; and &quot;avoid shipping replacement units&quot;. A GFCI-trip call is a worst-case scenario for an agent, and so they're going to say whatever they need to to get a satisfactory 1-call close.  That is about their only option.\n\nIn a rare case, the GFCI might be end-of-life and not be working properly, but that is easily tested by plugging it into the next outlet over that is on a different GFCI, since kitchens generally have 2 independent circuits.\n\nNow, other things can damage a coffee maker. Notably a &quot;Lost Neutral&quot;, where the neutral lead from the power company breaks, causing neutral in the house to wander - the two 120V &quot;halves of the service&quot; still add up to 240V but they are lopsided, with one side higher than 120V.

The network then decides which location to route a user request to, based on routing protocol costs and possibly the 'health' of the advertising servers.\n\nThere are several benefits to anycast. First, in steady state, users of an anycast service (DNS is an excellent example) will always connect to the 'closest' (from a routing protocol perspective) DNS server. This reduces latency, as well as providing a level of load-balancing (assuming that your consumers are evenly distributed around your network).\nAnother advantage is ease of configuration management. Rather than having to configure different DNS servers depending on where a server/workstation is deployed (Asia, America, Europe), you have one IP address that is configured in every location.\n\nDepending on how anycast is implemented, it can also provide a level of high availability. If the advertisement of the anycast route is conditional on some sort of health check (e.g. a DNS query for a well known domain, in this example), then as soon as a server fails its route can be removed. Once the network reconverges, user requests will be seamlessly forwarded to the next closest instance of DNS, without the need for any manual intervention or reconfiguration.\n\nA final advantage is that of horizontal scaling; if you find that one server is being overly loaded, simply deploy another one in a location that would allow it to take some proportion of the overloaded server's requests.

Aren't their power directly supplied by the battery of our camera?\nPlease answer for the built in flash on the 2000D and the traditional hot shoe Xenon flashes.\nPerhaps these hot shoe xenon flashes have their own batteries charged by the slow hot shoe port. Who knows? ", "The peak power at work when a flash is being discharged is extreme.\nExample: a classic Metz 45CT (a large but still handheld unit) on full manual power delivers around 90 watt-seconds of electrical output to the flash tube in 1/300s. That means there are 27000 watts at work for a short time.\nA 27000 watt lightbulb (BTW, your flash is much brighter than that - more efficient!) would need the ampacity of around eight european household sockets (230V, fused at 13 or 16 amps) to operate, since it would draw around 120 ampere from them. At the voltage levels xenon flash tubes typically operate at, around 80 amperes will flow; if you wanted to pull that energy \"live\" from a 5-6V battery, you'd need to pull around 5000 amperes AND instantaneously convert them to around 80 amperes at high voltage. Batteries that could deliver 5000 amps - while not wasting most of the power as heat generated across their internal resistance - for a short duration and live certainly exist - you are looking at starter batteries for big lorries, which are rather inconvenient to lug around. Also, a 5000 ampere current pulse is quite a magnetic nuisance if there is anything either ferromagnetic or intended as an electrical conductor near the conductors used.\nYour average \"big\" speedlite, btw, will be around half the power described here (but might in some cases reach the same or higher peak currents in order to discharge even faster), an in-camera flash will be a fraction of these numbers - but still inconvenient to build any other way.\nIf you need a short, massive current pulse, the best energy source available in engineering is a previously charged capacitor (metal-paper or electrolytic type, not dual-layer \"supercap\"). This energy storage device is large for its storage capacity if you compare it to a battery - but able to respond far quicker to high current demand, since a) there is no chemical energy conversion involved in its operation, b) the relevant current path only involves metallic, very conductive parts instead of ionic conductors (aka electrolytes. An electrolytic capacitor, btw, does use its electrolyte for chemical self-upkeep, not for chemical energy storage or electrical connectivity). \nAlso, since the charge in a a capacitor is limited, it allows portioning total energy to what the flashlamp can safely take. This allows a flash in manual mode to just completely discharge the capacitor until it is nearly empty (when the remaining charge can only deliver voltage below the quench voltage of the flashlamp) without complex control circuitry - and at the same time gives you a safety fallback when working with dynamically controlled power levels (telecomputer or TTL mode), leaving no way for catastrophic circuit failure in combination with several kilowatts of constant power available turning into a massive safety hazard.

It is called \"generalization/specialization\" in ER modeling, and \"superclass/subclass\" in object modeling.  \nAn object modeler uses the inheritance features built into the object model to solve the problem quite easily.  The subclasses simply extend the superclass.\nThe relational modeler is faced with a problem.  how to design the tables so as to emulate the benefits that one would get from inheritance?  \nThe simplest technique is called single table inheritance.  Data about all types of cars are grouped into a single table for cars.  There is a column, car_type, that groups together all the cars of a single type.  No car can belong to more than one type.  If a column is irrelevant to, say, electric cars,  it will be left NULL in the rows that pertain to electric cars.\nThis simple solution works well for the smaller and simpler cases.  The presence of a lot of NULLs adds a tiny bit to storage overhead, and a little bit to retrieval overhead.  The developer may have to learn SQL three-valued logic if boolean tests are done on nullable columns.  This can be baffling at first, but one gets used to it.\nThere is another technique, called class table inheritance.  In this design, there are separate tables for gas_car, electric_car, and hybrid_car, in addition to a combined table, car, for all of them.  When you want all of the data about a specific kind of car, you join the car table with the appropriate specialized table.  There are fewer NULLs in this design, but you do more joining.  This technique works better in the larger and more complex cases.\nThere is a third technique called shared primary key.  This technique is often used in conjunction with class table inheritance.  The specialized tables for the subclasses have, as their primary key, a copy of the primary key of the corresponding entry in the car table.  This id column can  be declared to be both the primary key and a foreign key.\nThis involves a little extra programming when new cars are to be added, but it makes the joins simple, easy, and fast.\nSuperclasses and subclasses happen all the time in the real world.

However, we opted to use analytical scales to measure the mass of the frogs because the mass variations that we expected to measure are of at least 1 g, a quantity signficantly higher than the uncertainty of even the most rudimentary analytical scales. We do, however, agree, that the quantum mechanical analysis of the molecular buildup in neural entangled channels in during frog electrophoresis, which is suggested as an interesting prospective investigation, will benefit from the low uncertainty provided by AMI. In order to make it clear that the methods used in our study were adequate, we have modified the original manuscript to include the following sentence in the second paragraph of page 5: While there are more precise methods to infer mass, such as atomic mass interferometry, analytical scales offer accuracies that are compatible with the 1 g mass variations that were found in this study (see Table 3, for instance).", "Do reviewers that make those kinds of comments tend to accept papers after these kinds of revisions?", "Reviewers don't accept papers, editors do.

The main objection was to the boardgame we were publishing, The Battle of Five Armies. The author of that game had given us a letter from his attorney claiming the work was grandfathered because it was published after the copyrights for JRRT's works had lapsed and before any renewals were made. The action also demanded we remove balrog, dragon, dwarf, elf, ent, goblin, hobbit, orc, and warg from the D&D game. Although only balrog and warg were unique names we agreed to hobbit as well, kept the rest, of course. The boardgame was dumped, and thus the suit was settled out of court at that.\n\nHalflings were originally called &quot;hobbits&quot; in the Dungeons & Dragons box set first released in 1974. Later printings changed this to &quot;halfling&quot;.\nAccording to The Acaeum, this change occurred between the fifth printing (Dec 1975 - Apr 1976) and sixth printing (1977), with the six printing being marked the Original Collector's Edition. However, Tim Kask has said that box sets were generally thrown together with whichever printings of the books were on hand, so the distinctions between printings are inexact. The Acaeum notes at least one box set shipped having the revised booklets but no Original Collector's Edition mark.\nDue to an oversight, a single reference to &quot;hobbit&quot; remained on page 6 of Men & Magic, which was fixed in the 2013 Deluxe reprint and PDF copies.\nAccording to Wikipedia, J.R.R. Tolkien sold the film, stage, and merchandising rights to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968, who sold them in turn to Saul Zaentz in 1976.

{"conversations": ["This claim was made popular by being said in the movie The Social Network. It exactly says:\n\n> Did you know there are more people with genius IQs living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States?\n", "This claim can actually be tested very easily. Others have done it, e.g. Brian Dickerson: The perils of repeating political nonsense and came to the conclusion that the claim was wrong.\n\nYou just need the chance a random person from a large group has a genius level IQ, then multiply it with the number of people in China and compare the result with the number of people in the USA. The IQ follows a Gaussian distribution where 100 is the mean by definition and a standard deviation (SD) of 15 (after Wechsler) or 16 (after Stanford-Binet). The rarity of a particular IQ can be calculated easily and are listed by the IQ Comparison Site. These numbers give the percentage of people with an IQ equal or lower than the given IQ and the rarity of this occurring.\n\nThe main question actually is what an genius level IQ is. There is no definite answer. According to the IQ Comparison Site, it is 140 or higher (\"Genius or near genius\") while another source states it as at least 160.\nThe rarity of such an IQ is 1/261 (with a SD of 15) or 1/161 (SD=16) for an IQ of 140 and 1/31,560 (SD=15) or 1/11,307 (SD=16) for an IQ of 160 according to Wikipedia. \n\nThe population of USA for 2012 is about 313,221,000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The population of China for 2011 is about 1,370,537,000.\nTaking the lowest rarity of 1/161 from above then there are about 1,370,537,000/161 =  about 8,513,000 geniuses in China, which is significantly less then the 313,221,000 Americans.\nIf you take the 15 SD value of 1/261 then you get only about 5,251,000 Chinese geniuses.\nWith the 160 IQ points, which are more realistic to indicate a real genius, the numbers are even smaller (about 43,400 or 12,100). Note that 1,370,537,000/313,221,000 = 4.375, so in order for this claim to be true actually one of every four (or say five) Chinese would need to be a Genius. Even without the numbers above, it can be easily understood that this is not the case.\nConclusion: This claim is wrong according to the definition and probabilities of the IQ.\n\nSupplement:\nIt has been pointed out, that there are published research results showing that China and other Asian countries have a higher average IQ of about 106 (or even as high as 115) as the normed average of 100. This would increase the number of geniuses in China: The above factor of 1/161 would drop to about 1/60 or, for a Chinese average of 115, even to about 1/17. These numbers can be easily calculated using the standard deviation, e.g. using MS Excel's function ```NORM.DIST(140, 106, 16, TRUE)```. However, both these factors are not in any way close to the US/Chinese population ratio of about 1/4.375, so the original conclusion still holds."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "An individual with an interest in demographics, statistics, and global population trends.

{"conversations": ["What factors determine the maximum altitude for a plane?\nIs it limited by wing design, engine thrust, and so on?\nIs there a formula by which one can calculate the maximum altitude a plane can reach?", "The higher you get, the lower the density of the air becomes. This lower density results in a lower lift being generated for the same airspeed and angle of attack. Effectively, the higher you fly the higher your minimum speed becomes. So while climbing, your speed needs to increase to compensate for the lower air density. As long a you can fly faster, the lower density at altitude can be compensated for. \nBasically there are two things that limit your maximum speed: thrust and speed of sound and with that your maximum altitude.\nFirst is thrust; the higher you get, the lower the thrust your engines deliver. You might note that drag goes down with the air density as well but since you are flying faster and faster during the climb the drag doesn't decrease at all. If your maximum altitude is limited by thrust then at some point during the climb the thrust and drag are getting close to equal and that is where the climb stops. When you can no longer climb with more than 100ft per minute (for propeller aircraft) or 500ft per minute (for jet / turbofan aircraft) you have reached your service ceiling. If the aircraft maximum altitude is determined by thrust, the absolute ceiling will take very long to reach. \nAt high altitudes air breathing engines will get difficulties eventually. Due to the lower air density the mass flow through the engine is reduced up to a point where it causes a flame out. \nThe other limitation is the speed of sound, at least for subsonic aircraft. In the process of generating lift, air flowing over the top of the wing is accelerated. At one point, when the aircraft is still flying below the speed of sound, shock waves will start to form over the wing. This results in increase of drag and reduces the lift. So provided you have enough engine power at your disposal you can climb to an altitude where your minimum speed is also your maximum speed. This is called the coffin corner. In the coffin corner:\n\n* if you fly any faster, you will exceed the maximum Mach number ($M_{mo}$) of your aircraft, resulting in high speed buffet, vibrations and possible loss of control. \n* if you fly any slower, the maximum lift that the wing can provide will be insufficient to maintain altitude. Descent or the aircraft will stall. \n* if you fly any higher and you will be too fast and too slow at the same time. \n* if you turn, you increase the wing loading, thereby increasing the minimum speed needed to create the required lift. Also the outer wing will easily exceed the maximum speed while at the same time the inner wing is below stall speed. This can quickly develop into a spin. \n\nSince accurate knowledge of engine performance, drag and wing characteristics of the aircraft is needed, there is not a simple formula to derive the maximum altitude for an aircraft.  \n\nApart from the aircraft performance related limitations above there is a certified maximum operating altitude for the pressurized cabin. This takes into account the structural properties of the hull (pressure difference between inside and outside) and the achievable emergency descent rate in case of a depressurization event."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "an aeronautical engineer, aviation enthusiast, or aerospace researcher with a strong interest in aircraft design and performance.

Is there a survey or something similar on this topic?", "There are a number of well-studied strategies; which is best in your application depends on circumstance.\n\n* Improve worst case runtime\nUsing problem-specific insight, you can often improve the naive algorithm. For instance, there are $O(c^n)$ algorithms for Vertex Cover with $c huge improvement over the naive $\\Omega(2^n)$ and might make instance sizes relevant for you tractable.\n\n* Improve expected runtime\nUsing heuristics, you can often devise algorithms that are fast on many instances. If those include most that you meet in practice, you are golden. Examples are SAT for which quite involved solvers exist, and the Simplex algorithm (which solves a polynomial problem, but still). One basic technique that is often helpful is branch and bound.\n\n* Restrict the problem\nIf you can make more assumptions on your inputs, the problem may become easy.\n\n* Structural properties\nYour inputs may have properties that simplify solving the problem, e.g. planarity, bipartiteness or missing a minor for graphs. See here for some examples of graph classes for which CLIQUE is easy.  \n\n* Bounding functions of the input\nAnother thing to look at is parameterised complexity; some problems are solvable in time $O(2^kn^m)$ for $k$ some instance parameter (maximum node degree, maximum edge weight, ...) and $m$ constant. If you can bound $k$ by a polylogarithmic function in $n$ in your setting, you get polynomial algorithms. Saeed Amiri gives details in his answer.\n\n* Bounding input quantities\nFurthermore, some problems admit algorithms that run in pseudo-polynomial time, that is their runtime is bounded by a polynomial function in a number that is part of the input; the naive primality check is an example. This means that if the quantities encoded in your instances have reasonable size, you might have simple algorithms that behave well for you.\n\n* Weaken the result\nThis means that you tolerate errorneous or incomplete results. There are two main flavors:\n\n* Probabilistic algorithms\nYou only get the correct result with some probability. There are some variants, most notable Monte-Carlo and Las-Vegas algorithms. A famous example is the Miller-Rabin primality test.\n\n* Approximation algorithms\nYou no longer look for optimal solutions but almost optimal ones. Some algorithms admit relative (\"no worse than double the optimum\"), others absolute (\"no worse than $5$ plus the optimum\") bounds on the error. For many problems it is open how well they can be approximated. There are some that can be approximated arbitrarily well in polynomial time, while others are known to not allow that; check the theory of polynomial-time approximation schemes.\n\nRefer to Algorithmics for Hard Problems by Hromkovi\u010d for a thorough treatment.\n* Simplicity is beauty: Improved upper bounds for vertex cover by Chen Jianer, Iyad A.

{"conversations": ["Apparently, the air inside a soap bubble is under higher pressure than the surrounding air. This is for instance apparent in the sound bubbles make when they burst. Why is the pressure inside the bubble higher in the first place?", "The increased pressure is caused by the surface tension between the soap and the surrounding air. This can be seen by a simple equilibrium energy argument. The total energy of the system reads\n$$\n  E = E_i + E_o + E_s \\;,\n$$\nwhere $E_i$ is the energy associated with the air inside the bubble, $E_s$ is the interfacial energy, and $E_o$ denotes the energy associated with the air outside of the bubble. Importantly, the contribution of the surface energy is given by $E_s = 2 \\gamma A$, where $\\gamma$ is the surface tension and $A$ is the surface area of the bubble. The factor of 2 emerges, since there are actually two interfaces (one facing the inside of the soap bubble and one facing the outside).\n\nIn equilibrium, the total energy will be minimal. We thus analyze the total differential of the energy. Here, the differentials of the partial energies of the air can be approximated by the ideal gas law, which yields $dE_i = -p_i dV_i$ and $dE_o = -p_o dV_o$.\n\nNext, we have to discuss the degrees of freedom of the system. Generally, the soap bubble wants to keep its spherical shape to minimize the surface area (and thus the surface energy $E_s$) at a given volume. This leaves us with a single parameter, the radius $R$ of the bubble, which can be varied in any process. The volume differentials then become $dV_1 = 4\\pi R^2 dR$ and $dV_2 = -4\\pi R^2 dR$. Additionally, the surface area changes by $dA = 8\\pi R dR$. The differential of the surface energy thus reads $dE_s = 2\\gamma 8\\pi R dR$, provided that the surface tension stays constant.\n\nNow we got everything and can express the differential of the total energy as\n$$\n  dE = -p_i 4 \\pi R^2 dR + p_o 4\\pi R^2 dR + 2\\gamma 8\\pi R dR \\;.\n$$\nDividing by $4\\pi R^2$ and noting that $dE/dR$ vanishes in equilibrium, we thus arrive at\n$$\n  p_i - p_o = \\frac{4\\gamma}{R} \\;.\n$$\nThis expression shows that the pressure inside the bubble is large than outside. The pressure difference is two times the Laplace pressure $2\\gamma/R$.", "Can this be viewed intuitively from the perpective of the fact that in order for a bubble to form a higher-pressure must be applied to the air in front of the bubble; i.e. it must be blown into? Since this high-pressure air is the air that goes into the bubble, shouldn't this air be of this higher pressure for all time, rather like a balloon?", "It is true, that the ideas employed here are the same that would explain why the pressure inside a balloon is higher than outside. In order to inflate a balloon you want to blow extra air inside it. This is only possible when the pressure you create in your mouth is larger than the pressure in the interior of the balloon, since the air always flows from regions of large to small pressure in this example. Consequently, the fact that your have to blow quite a bit means that there is quite some pressure inside the balloon."], "source": "multi_turn", "questioner": "a science enthusiast or student with a keen interest in physics, particularly the properties of gases and liquids.

{"conversations": ["Given that Kohn-Sham DFT is strictly a ground-state method (at 0 K), how is it sufficient to describe materials in real-life applications?", "These are a few extra points to complement Andrew Rosen's comprehensive response:\n\n* To be absolutely clear, typical DFT calculations are not performed at 0K, a better description of what happens is that they are performed \"for a static crystal\". Static crystal means that the atoms are fixed at their crystallographic positions (which is what a typical DFT calculation does), but this situation is different from 0K. Even at 0K, the atomic nuclei move due to quantum zero-point motion (also called quantum fluctuations). This quantum zero-point motion is very small for compounds containing heavy elements, which means that in these cases \"0K\" and \"static crystal\" are almost the same and many people use the terms interchangeably. However, quantum zero-point motion can be very large for light elements, for example in solid hydrogen (the lightest of all compounds) it dominates even at room temperature. To perform a calculation at 0K (as opposed to a static crystal calculation), the strategy that Andrew Rosen proposed would still work if you use quantum statistics. For example, solving the vibrational problem within the harmonic approximation at the quantum mechanical level with give you the zero-point energy as the ground state of a quantum harmonic oscillator. A good reference for hydrogen is this review article.\n* Although Andrew Rosen is correct in that the potential energy surface is largely temperature independent, there are a few situations in which the potential energy surface does vary significantly with temperature. An example of this is provided by many perovskite crystals (e.g. $\\ce{BaTiO_3}$), which undergo a series of temperature-induced structural phase transitions. For example, at very high temperatures the structure is cubic, and this structure sits at a minimum of the potential free energy surface. However, if you calculated the potential energy surface (instead of the free energy surface), then it has a double-well shape and the cubic structure is at the saddle point, so the structure will lower its energy by distorting and going to one of the minima. This is precisely what happens at low temperatures because the corresponding free energy surface acquires a double-well shape, and the system undergoes a structural phase transition. A good early DFT reference for this is this paper.\n* As already pointed out by others, the differences between DFT and TDDFT or $GW$-BSE are not related to the inclusion or exclusion of temperature. In this language, both TDDFT and $GW$-BSE have no temperature for the behaviour of the nuclei, and you could incoporate it in a similar fashion to what Andrew Rosen described for DFT.\n"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A researcher or scientist specializing in computational materials science, particularly quantum chemistry and density functional theory (DFT).

Meeting the Section 508* requirements for Web pages used in such a course is effectively without cost if one starts out to make such pages accessible. Retrofitting might cost as much as the original project, but the cost should be near zero for modern MOOCs.\n\n* Captioning and Transcripts: Closed (or open) captions are very expensive. Unless done at a foreign sweatshop, cost is $5.00 to $15.00 per minute, so something like $12,000 as a minimum, up over $35,000, for a one-semester course. In other words, the captioning can cost more than the professor. That's at least part of why some institutions employ ASL interpreters for class sections with deaf students. The $5-15 number given above could be reduced by using student labor, especially if the students are majors in the material being subtitled. In addition, captioning through voice recognition is getting much better, but still requires certain amount of manual editing. \n\n* Audio Descriptions: Making course materials available to the blind means being sure that everything that is shown is also described, either by the speaker who is presenting or in a manner that can be rendered through text-to-speech. The latter means being sure that there are good \"alt\" descriptions of images and that appropriate markup, e.g. MathML, is used for things like equations. In disciplines like computing, that isn't onerous, and the costs may disappear in the weeds of getting the course done. Things might be very different in a discipline like the visual arts.\n\n* Screen Reader Compatibility: Ensuring that the MOOC is compatible with screen readers and assistive technologies can involve additional development and testing efforts. This cost may vary depending on the complexity of the course platform and its current level of accessibility.\n\nIt is recommended to consult with accessibility experts, organizations specializing in accessible design, or accessibility consultants who can provide more accurate estimates based on the specific requirements of your MOOC.

Thomas dissents on the grounds that the President &quot;may be entitled to relief against [a subpoena's] enforcement&quot; based on his special status as president.

Carbonated water is actually a weak carbonic acid solution; this is what you taste.

The former has more chance of happening, before the ice even has the time to start melting.\nThe only way to shoot it without shattering it nor melting it, at least using weapons available to us, would be to use compressed air weapons, but it would need to be significantly powered down to prevent the bullet from shattering, so it would probably not be powerful enough to cause damage.\nThe force needed to break through one square inch of ice is roughly 400 pounds on average. The bullet you're trying to fire is probably 9mm, but let's just calculate as though it was about one square inch (although it's actually quite smaller than that): those 400 pounds equal roughly 1800N.\nThe force that comes out of a 9mm gun is approximately 383 ft-lbs, which equals to 520 newtons per metre. That amount is about 52000N per centimetre. One inch is about 2 and a half centimeters, so that means it's more about 20'800N per inch. As you can see, it's a lot more than what it takes to break ice.\nAs for the \"wall\" towards which something has to be pushed in order to break it, the air will fulfill the role: the atmospheric pressure is about 15 pounds per square inch: it doesn't seem like a lot, but in the time it takes the bullet to win this force and gain momentum, it gets shattered by the enormous amount of energy produced by the weapon.", "what makes you think it would shatter?

{"conversations": ["My cat keeps scratching up my furniture. What are some ways to train her to stop?", "Cats scratch furniture for a variety of reasons, so you'll have to work out why yours is scratching in particular. It's usually because it wants to claw off old nail sheaths, or because it wants to mark its territory. Here are a number of things you can do to train her not to scratch your furniture.\n\nFirst, you can trim her nails regularly. If you trim your cat's nails regularly, then it will be less likely for her to want to scratch because it will be more uncomfortable for her to do so. Plus, it will reduce the damage done by scratching because the claws won't be as sharp.\n\nSecond, you can cover the areas with something unpleasant, like tin foil or double-sided tape. This should discourage her from scratching there, and she'll (hopefully) learn to go to her scratching post instead.\nThird, you can try to redirect her attention when she starts to scratch where she shouldn't. If you catch her in the act, make a loud noise (clapping is good) and she should stop. Then, if you have a scratching post nearby, encourage her to scratch there instead. Give her a treat if she scratches the post, or praise her verbally. She'll learn that scratching the post gets her good things, while scratching the furniture gets her nothing.\n\nFinally, you can try a combination of all of the above. Trim her nails, cover the furniture, and when you catch her scratching the furniture, clap your hands and show her the scratching post.\n\nWith consistent effort, you should be able to break her furniture-scratching habit. It may take a few weeks, but it can be done.\n"], "source": "authors", "questioner": "A pet owner who is experiencing issues with their feline companion damaging household items.

{"conversations": ["How to tell if it's an acquaintance, friend, crush, or love?", "Feelings and emotions can be complex and difficult to understand, especially when trying to decipher those of someone you know.  Are you simply an acquaintance?  Do they consider you a friend?  Is it love or just a crush? There are many layers to relationships and it's not always clear where you stand with someone.  However, there are several different methods to decode how a person feels about you and perceives your relationship.\n\n## Read body language\n\n1. Notice the amount of eye contact. People\u2019s eyes can be very expressive and tell a lot about how they\u2019re feeling toward those around them. Friends will make eye contact with each other during conversation to show interest and respect. Someone with a crush on you will make repeated eye contact with you whether in a conversation or not. A crush may hold eye contact for a few seconds, and then look away from shyness, and find your gaze again later. Dilated pupils are another indication of a crush. Someone who\u2019s in love with you will feel totally comfortable locking gazes for extended periods of time.\n2. Gauge proximity. The amount of space people choose to place between themselves and others can be an indicator of their perceived relationships with those around them. Someone who is your friend will stand or sit closer to you than an acquaintance. A person with a crush on you will stand near you, lean toward you, and look for reasons to get closer to you- whether it\u2019s intentionally walking past you at a close range, or leaning in closer than necessary to talk to you. People who are in love will stand or sit very close together- perhaps their hips touch when standing side by side or their knees touch when sitting across from one another.\n3. Monitor movement. Our movements, whether conscious or unconscious, can convey lots of different meanings about how we feel about those around us. Friends will tilt their heads while in conversations with other friends to show that they\u2019re listening. They may touch each other in light, casual ways on the hand or arm. Someone with a crush will look for reasons to touch the other person, often in a playful and flirty way. They may seem fidgety or nervous, and may subconsciously begin to copy the movements of their crush. Someone who is in love with you will seem very comfortable and secure around you. They may touch you using gentle, caressing gestures.\n4. Pay attention to posture. The way a person stands (or sits) when they're around you may give you some clues as to how they feel about you. A friend will stand with his or her shoulders and face pointing toward you. If sitting, he or she will uncross his or her legs to show that he or she is open to you. His or her palms may be open toward you as well, another sign of receptivity. When someone has a crush on you, they stand tall and slightly stick their chest out. Additionally, they will point their toes and hips toward you, as a sign of wanting to move toward you (both figuratively and literally).\n\n\n## Listen for verbal cue\n\n1. Recognize vocal tone. The inflection and quality of a person\u2019s voice will change subconsciously depending on the feelings they have toward you. Listen to how someone talks in general, and compare it with they sound when talking to you individually. A friend\u2019s voice will remain constant, with little to no change in pitch or tone. A crush\u2019s voice will have a playful and flirtatious quality to it. Women use a higher pitch to accentuate their femininity. Men use a lower pitch, but alter the pitch, almost to a \u201csing-song\u201d tone, to both highlight masculinity, and make a woman feel at ease. People who are in love will alter their voices to match their partners\u2019. Men talk in a higher pitch and women a lower one to show that they are connected as one.\n2. Think about how casual your conversations are. A conversation between friends is usually casual and comfortable. Both you and your friend ask and answer questions equally, and may or may not make future plans to hang out.\n3. Notice how much they talk about themselves. If someone has a crush, they will talk a lot about themselves, both from nerves and as a way to \u201chumble-brag.\u201d They will also ask about you, and agree enthusiastically with what you say to make it seem like you have things in common.\n4. Analyze how intimate your conversations are. If someone is in love with you, they will open up to you in intimate ways. You may find out about their deep insecurities and fears, childhood, family dynamics, important personal values, and vision for the future. They may plan future vacations, or invite you to meet family.\n\n\n## Analyze your relationship\n\n1. Reflect on your relationship. Take some time in a quiet place simply to think about your feelings toward the person in question, and your interactions with them. Some questions to consider are:\n\t* How long have you known this person? How frequently do you see or talk to them? Is the communication equitable? What is the level of intimacy shared (either physically or conversationally)? How would you characterize your time together? Do you both seem to enjoy being together?\n2. Make a list. If you\u2019re trying to determine whether someone is a friend or a crush, make a \u201cFriend/Crush\u201d list. If you\u2019re figuring out whether someone is in love with you, make a \u201cLike/Love\u201d list. Like a Pro/Con list, record any specific behavior that would indicate how they feel about you. Having a visual aid way may give you more insight into how they feel.\n3. Ask a trusted friend for help. Sometimes our feelings toward someone can cloud our judgment in assessing their behavior. A friend can offer an honest, objective observation of the relationship, and will be less likely to allow personal feelings to affect their understanding.\n\n\n## Ask directly\n\n1. Express your feelings first. If you\u2019re asking someone to open up to you, then you need to be upfront with them as well. If you\u2019re looking for honesty, you need to show you\u2019re capable of reciprocating. People are more likely to be direct with you if you\u2019re direct with them. Start with a sentence like, \"I want you to know that I feel\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_about you/our relationship. I'm hoping you'll be just as honest and share your feelings about me.\"\n2. Ask in a tactful, non-threatening way. Explain that you\u2019re simply trying to gain some insight and clarity in your relationship, and that you respect their feelings no matter what. It\u2019s important for your partner to know that they can open up to you, without an abrasive reaction. Try saying something like, \"I want you to know that I will completely honor and respect your answer, even if it's not the one I want to hear.\"\n3. Be prepared for the consequences. There\u2019s a chance you and your partner may be on two different wavelengths in terms of your relationship. Their answer may sting a little. Take some time to decide how you want to proceed in the relationship, knowing exactly how your partner feels about you.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A young adult or teen seeking guidance on navigating interpersonal relationships.

If you haven't exercised in a long time, your body isn't going to be able to handle a lot. Start with walking. Do some basic stretches (don't stretch too much, it's actually bad for you if you haven't warmed up). Walk for 15-20 minutes a day, and do some light stretches (no bending over touching your toes type stuff).\n* Make a plan. Saying \"I'm going to exercise\" is pretty vague. Write down what you plan to do, and when. If you're going to lift weights, write down which exercises you're going to do, and how many sets and reps. If you're going to run, write down your route, and how long it usually takes you. Having a plan will help you track your progress, and keep you motivated.\n* Don't overdo it. If you're just starting out, twice a week is good. You need rest to build muscle, so don't be afraid to take a day off between workouts. You can always increase the frequency as you go.\n* Make it a habit. This is important. After a while, your workout schedule should become a habit, like brushing your teeth.

{"conversations": ["I want to learn a new language. What are some resources and tips for language learning?", "From free apps to immersive online courses, there are many resources to learn a new language. Some great apps and online programs include Rosetta Stone, Duolingo, Babbel, etc. It\u2019s also a good idea to take language classes in person or online, where you can ask your teacher questions and practice speaking with your teacher and classmates.\n\nHere are some other tips for learning a new language:\n\n* Set your language goals. When you\u2019re first figuring out how to learn a language, you should focus on some short-, medium- and long-term goals. These can help to give structure and direction to your learning. Adding timescales to your language-learning goals can help to keep you on track and motivated. \n\n* Learn common vocabulary. This can help to quickly build your understanding in a day-to-day setting, allowing you to have and follow basic conversations. \n\n* Find a style that works for you. There are many different tools, techniques, and styles you can use when you\u2019re learning a language. Whether it\u2019s using flashcards, grammar translations, spaced repetition, immersive learning or any other approach, you have plenty of options. Figuring out the right combination of techniques can help you progress at a rate you\u2019re happy with. You\u2019ll find all kinds of apps, websites, textbooks, and other materials out there that help with different methods.  \n\n* Practice speaking. A crucial part of learning a language is being able to recognise, understand and reproduce sounds. You don\u2019t have to necessarily go out and start chatting with native speakers right away (although this can certainly help). However, talking to yourself, practicing your vocabulary out loud, and even recording yourself speaking your new language can help to build your confidence. \n\n*  Connect with a native speaker. Communicating with new people in your target language is often intimidating. You might be scared to make mistakes or feel that your current level isn\u2019t good enough.

{"conversations": ["Did Hillary Clinton propose to punish flag burners in 2005?", "The proposed law co-sponsored by Clinton in 2005 prohibits flag burning under specific circumstances. It does not attempt to make flag burning illegal in general (i.e. outside of those specific circumstances). Clinton has voted against a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would allow Congress to ban flag burning in general.\n\nIn 2005, Clinton co-sponsored the Flag Protection Act of 2005, whose summary is as follows:\n\n> Flag Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding desecration of the flag to prohibit: (1) destroying or damaging a U.S. flag with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace; (2) intentionally threatening or intimidating any person, or group of persons, by burning a U.S. flag; or (3) stealing or knowingly converting the use of a U.S. flag belonging to the United States, or belonging to another person on U.S. lands, and intentionally destroying or damaging that flag.\n\nIt seems like a reaction to ongoing efforts to pass a constitutional amendment allowing Congress to ban flag burning, a move that the co-sponsors of the 2005 act oppose and voted against. Its text notes:\n\n> the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by free and democratic nations\n\nbut suggests that flag burning with intent to incite violence is not protected by the Constitution (unlike flag burning as political expression, which is protected):\n\n> destruction of the flag of the United States can be intended to incite a violent response rather than make a political statement and such conduct is outside the protections afforded by the first amendment to the Constitution.\n\nNote that the distinction between \n\n* banning flag burning for being offensive, and \n* banning flag burning when it incites violence or disturbs the peace\n\nis an important one. The Flag Protection Act proposed in 2005 was essentially a replacement for a previous Flag Protection Act that banned flag burning in general:\n\n> Whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\n\nbut this was deemed unconstitutional in United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 in 1990, on the basis of their earlier (1989) decision in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397. There, the Supreme Court noted that\n\n> an important governmental interest in regulating nonspeech can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms when speech and nonspeech elements are combined in the same course of conduct\n\nbut that in the case under consideration, this did not apply:\n\n> An interest in preventing breaches of the peace is not implicated on this record. \n\nand further noted that \n\n> Expression may not be prohibited [p398] on the basis that an audience that takes serious offense to the expression may disturb the peace, since the Government cannot assume that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot, but must look to the actual circumstances surrounding the expression.\n\nClinton was not one of the 59 co-sponsors of a proposed amendment to the constitution that would allow Congress to ban flag burning in general:\n\n> Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States authorizing Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\nand she also voted against it.

{"conversations": ["How to deal with diagnosis of a rare chromosome disorder in a child?", "Most people have heard of Down syndrome. But there are hundreds of other chromosome disorders a child can have, many of which are diagnosed in only a few children, or may even be unique to that child.\n\n## Get information\n\n1. Learn about genetics. Most people have 46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. One pair is the sex chromosomes, which in males is usually XY and in females XX. The other 22 pairs, known as autosomes, are numbered by size, with chromosome 1 being the biggest. Each chromosome has a longer arm, called the q arm, and a shorter arm, called the p arm. Each arm has bands that are numbered, with the band closest to the middle (centromere) being numbered 11.1. Terminus (shortened to \"ter\") refers to a tip of a chromosome. A \"terminal\" chromosome disorder is not fatal; it just involves the terminus. Learn about the types of changes. Nullisomy means that there are zero copies of a chromosome. Deletion/monosomy means that there is only one copy of the chromosome or piece of chromosome. Duplication/trisomy means that there are 3 copies. Tetrasomy and pentasomy refer to 4 and 5 copies, respectively. Translocations are when chromosomes swap material. If it is balanced, this means the same number of copies of material is present, but they are arranged differently - for example they have part of 3q on 2q and part of 2q on 3q, but it all adds up to the same thing. If it is unbalanced, the child has trisomy and/or monosomy for some part of the involved chromosomes. Very often, an unbalanced translocation is inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation, but it can also occur as a new mutation, which is called 'de novo'. For example, they may have part of 2q missing and part of 3q in its place, causing partial monosomy of 2q and partial trisomy of 3q. In an unbalanced translocation, the abnormal chromosome is called the derivative chromosome, or der for short. So they may write t(2;3)der(2) to indicate the child has the 2 with chromosome 3 material instead of the 3 with chromosome 2 material.\n2. Find medical information on your child's condition. There may not be much out there, but find what you can, because it can give you an idea what to expect for your child. Be careful to pay attention to what specific chromosome region is affected, including what bands are involved - even though they both have 22q deletion, kids with 22q11 deletion have a totally different syndrome from 22q13 deletion. Also keep in mind duplication/trisomy versus deletion/monosomy, because these are genetic opposites. When reading medical case studies, remember that they focus on the negative. You're probably not going to hear the doctor talk about how sweet and caring the child is, or how much their parents feel lucky for knowing them, because it's not medically relevant. You will learn about some of the health problems your kid could face.\n3. See if parents have written about your child's condition. Depending on how rare the condition is, there may be other parents out there who have written about what it is like to raise a child who has it.\n4. Look for adults with your child's condition. Many adults with genetic disabilities are able to use computers when they become adults. Do any of them have blogs or social media accounts? They may be able to offer good advice. Here are some benefits of learning from adults with disabilities:\n\t* They can tell you about the parenting strategies that did and didn't help. They may be able to offer detailed advice about your child. Watching them can help you envision what your child's life will be like someday.\n\n\n## Cop\n\n1. Don't assume the worst. Many doctors, when they don't know the prognosis for a condition, will act like it's more severe than it really is. Even parents of kids with very mild chromosome disorders have been told their child will never walk or talk and/or will die in infancy. If your child has a rare syndrome, take dire prognoses with a grain of salt.\n2. Recognize that infancy is the worst time. For many chromosomal conditions, the first year or two of life are the hardest, as caregivers and healthcare providers try to figure out the child's needs. It won't always be this bad, and it's likely to get easier. If you've been told that your child may die, recognize that extreme early death usually happens in the first 3 years of life, or not at all. If your child is fine at age 4, they'll probably be fine at age 24 and age 44.\n3. Give yourself time to process. You may feel a range of emotions as you realize that your child's life will look different than you thought it would. This is normal. Don't expect yourself to adjust immediately.\n4. Tell other people how they can support you. People around you may want to help, but not know what they can do. Let them know what your family needs, and give them the opportunity to help. \"Between all the doctor appointments, we barely have time to cook. It would be really nice to have someone prepare a meal or maybe invite us for dinner once in a while.\" \"We could really use a babysitter on weekends.\" \"We're so busy for with the baby that the kids can feel left out. If they could go to your house to play with your kids sometimes, it might help cheer them up.\" \"I'm really worried about the upcoming surgery. My wife can't be there due to her conference. It would really help to have someone there with me.\"\n5. Make peace with the fact that life will be different. Your child is going to learn differently, behave differently, and show you how much they love you differently. Sometimes it will be harder, but there will also be beautiful parts. Remember that not every quirk is a deficit. Some differences are positives, and others are neither good nor bad. It's okay for your child to be unique.\n6. Take time for yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup, and you can't help your child much if you're physically and emotionally exhausted. Try to set aside a little \"me time\" each day, even if it's only 5 minutes. Ask yourself \"What would help me feel better right now?\" Could it be a shower? A cup of tea? A hug? Try to get it.\n\n\n## Move forward\n\n1. Seek out parent support groups. If you can find other parents of kids with the same or overlapping chromosome disorders, great, but even parents of kids with completely different conditions can be a great source of support. UNIQUE has leaflets on many rare conditions.\n2. Get therapy early. Early intervention is important. As soon as your child is medically stable, sign them up for physical, occupational and/or speech therapy - even if they are still a tiny baby. This will help them reach their full potential. Although very few kids with chromosome disorders are so affected that they can't walk or talk, most have some degree of cognitive or learning disability. The more they can do for themselves, the less support they will need from others in adulthood. Take notes during therapy and ask for activities that you can do at home. Bad therapists do exist. If a therapist tells you to be cruel or punitive towards your child, find a new therapist. Childhood should be fun, not scary. You don't want your child to gain an anxiety disorder along with their new skills.\n3. Make time for your child's siblings, if there are any. At times, they may feel left out, especially if you're busy taking care of your disabled child's needs. Try to spend quality time with each of your children every day. If you don't spend time with a child on one day, try to make up for it during the weekend.\n4. Celebrate your child! Your child is different, and they have their own special combination of traits that make them who they are. Love them for who they are, and treasure the good moments. Some conditions, such as Williams syndrome, include positive aspects. Let go of the idea of the child you could have had, and focus on the real child you have right now. They need your love.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned parent or guardian of a child recently diagnosed with a rare chromosome disorder.

{"conversations": ["How to diagnose adrenal gland disease in pomeranians?", "Pomeranians are a breed that are especially prone to baldness problems. While your dog may have other adrenal gland diseases, such as Cushing's Disease or Addison's Disease, Alopecia X is the most common condition that affects Pomeranians. Adrenal gland disease goes by a variety of names, such as Alopecia X, Black Skin Disease, and Growth Hormone Responsive Dermatosis, among others. Adrenal gland disease is a puzzling condition, and vets are not really sure of the cause. There are ways to diagnose if your dog has this condition.\n\n## Identify symptoms\n\n1. Watch for odd patches of fur. One of the first signs of adrenal gland disease is patches of hair that look different than the rest of the coat. These patches will contain hair that is short and oddly textured, like wool.\n2. Look for symmetrical hair loss. When a dog has adrenal gland disease, the Pomeranian sheds her fur right down to the skin and the fur doesn't regrow. The fur loss is in a symmetrical pattern so the hair loss on the left of the body mirrors that on the right. Hair loss usually occurs on the trunk and back thighs, and not on the head or front legs.\n3. Watch for dark patches of skin. When the dog loses her hair, the exposed skin often becomes hyperpigmented. This means that the skin changes from a regular pink or beige color into a dark brown or black color. Additionally, the skin is often dry and scaly.\n4. Be alert for any lack of hair growth. Another way you know your Pomeranian has this condition is that hair does not regrow after it has been clipped or shaved.\n5. Know that this condition can affect any dog. Pomeranians of any age or sex can be affected. This means that through your dog\u2019s entire life, you need to watch for signs of this condition. Although a dog can get this condition any time, the dog is healthy otherwise even if she does start to show the symptoms.\n\n\n## Diagnose the disease\n\n1. Be aware of an unspecific diagnosis. The problem with diagnosing adrenal gland disease is that vets aren't sure why it occurs in the first place. This makes it impossible to develop a single test that gives a definitive answer as whether baldness is specifically due adrenal gland disease or some other problem.\n2. Take your dog to the vet. The vet has to rule out all other problems which could cause hair loss. This means conducting an extensive array of tests searching for specific conditions, which can then be confirmed or crossed off the list. Once all these tests are done, and if they all come back negative, then the condition is likely to be adrenal gland disease. Adrenal gland disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, which means all other possible causes of hair loss have to be crossed off the list in order to diagnose the condition. Many of the symptoms of adrenal gland disease, like hair loss, can be due to more serious diseases, such as Cushing's Disease. Alopecia X is not life threatening, but other adrenal gland diseases can be serious if left untreated. This is why taking your dog to the vet is so important.\n3. Have multiple tests run. The vet may want to run some or all of the following tests, which will prove or rule out other conditions which may be similar to adrenal gland disease. The tests include:\n\t* Thyroid blood test\n\t* Adrenal hormone test\n\t* A urinalysis\n\t* Abdominal ultrasound\n\t* Skin scrapes\n\t* Skin biopsy\n\t* Screening blood tests\n4. Notice the effects of this disease. When your dog gets this condition, know that it is a cosmetic condition. Your dog will not be in any pain. If your vet has ruled out any other underlying condition, then your dog can live a happy life with the condition.\n5. Find the proper treatment. Most treatments for Alopecia X focus on helping the dog grow the coat back, but they are trial and error. Many adrenal gland problems are caused by hormonal imbalances, so dogs may be spayed or neutered. If this is not an option, melatonin therapy may be suggested. Other treatment options may be available if these don't work. However, they can cause adverse reactions, so the adverse health effects need to be considered next to the cosmetic benefits.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A veterinarian or a pet owner with a Pomeranian who may be experiencing symptoms related to adrenal gland disease.

{"conversations": ["How to play sonic unleashed for xbox 360?", "Some people may find Sonic Unleashed on the Xbox 360 hard. But it's pretty easy with practice. Some may find it hard to press several buttons quickly.\n\n## Controller basics\n\n1. When you're holding the controller, put your index & middle finger on the trigger and bumper buttons (so you'll be ready to drift when needed) and put your left thumb on the right analog stick and left thumb on the A,X,Y and B buttons.\n2. The left control stick is used to move Sonic; the A button is used for jumping ; the B button is used to boost; the X button is used to stomp or crouch; the Y button is used for the light speed dash; the trigger buttons are used for drifting; and the bumper buttons are used for side stepping left and right.\n3. Many new skills and upgrades can be obtained through certain conditions, progressing through the game, or by buying them with yellow diamonds you get from enemies.\n\n\n## Boost guidelines\n\n1. To reach the highest speeds, drift in a straight line (this is not something you need to do, but it does speed you along and again it's more of an expert technique).\n2. When you're on a slope going upwards, when near you're near top of it, jump and it will give you maximum height and to boost over some areas.\n3. Try boosting then jumping right after then boosting again in the air to boost over a whole area.\n\n\n## Attack techniques\n\n1. The main method of defeating enemies is the homing attack. Try to use this also for combo attacks for bonus points and getting to places beyond Sonic's reach or to correct any missed/wrongly timed jumps.\n2. Stomping is another way of attacking enemies and is used best when attacking from above or when a homing attack doesn't work or isn't as effective.\n3. Ironically enough, you can actually use the speed boost and drift to take down groups of enemies at high speeds that you normally can't take down or would take longer with conventional attack moves.\n\n\n## 2d platforming\n\n1. 2D sections are more platform based and as a result are much harder and take longer to do. Remember to not be as reckless when going through these sections; do not use the speed boost unless Sonic is running in a harmless path.\n2. Properly time your homing attacks, crouches, light speed dashes, and wall jumps by being as fast as possible, pressing the button combos well, and by following the on-screen button prompt as it's needed in order to succeed through 2D platforming.\n3. Take alternate routes with cannons, grind rails, zip-lines, and other mechanisms to skip large portions of the 2D sections with little to no risk.\n\n\n## Trick\n\n1. There are many tricks and techniques that aren't mentioned in the game or is difficult to pull off. One should master them to beat the levels more easily and have a better time, which includes the aerial boost, parkour, sky diving, and drifting.\n2. Aerial boosting is simply pressing a set of buttons that appear on-screen when Sonic files into the air and everything becomes slow; successfully pressing these buttons within a short time allows Sonic to go over gaps and reach out of reach places.\n3. Parkour tricks such as running on walls and wall-jumping (in 3D areas) can be utilized by speed boosting on walls and pressing the button that appears on-screen when Sonic attempts to wall-jump on certain walls.\n4. Sky diving is simply diving really fast while in the air after Sonic is free falling to an area below; pressing the X button will increase your speed while titling the control stick controls your position which can help avoid obstacles and reach the ground faster.\n5. Drifting is turning around sharp corners without losing speed; this is difficult to maneuver as Sonic's natural speed interferes with his handling - simply tilt the control stick left and right (slightly) to make drifting easier to do.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A gaming enthusiast who is a fan of the Sonic series and is specifically interested in playing Sonic Unleashed on their Xbox 360 console.

You can get a copy of this notice by sending a request to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) department. However, you might want a copy of the Form I-140 petition itself. In this situation, you will need to make a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to USCIS.\n\n## Request a copy of your approval notice\n\n1. Download Form I-824. This is the form you need to fill out to get a copy of your Form I-797 Notice of Action. The form is available for download from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website. You should download it in PDF format and also get a copy of the instructions. You can also request a form by calling 1-800-375-5283. You cannot use this form if your approval notice has expired or been revoked.\n2. Get a copy of the original petition or application. If available, send a copy of the original I-140 petition. If you don\u2019t have a copy, then ask your employer to provide you with one. However, if you don\u2019t have it, then you don\u2019t need to include it.\n3. Make a copy of your Form I-797. If you have your Form I-797 (but want an additional copy), then send a copy along with your application. You need to submit both the front and the back. If you don\u2019t have the Form I-797, then you don\u2019t need to send it.\n4. Complete Form I-824. You can complete the form in PDF format. Type in the requested information. Answer all questions and type \u201cN/A\u201d or \u201cnot applicable\u201d to anything that applies. The form will ask for the following information:\n\t* your reason for the request: check \u201cA duplicate approval notice\u201d\n\t* name\n\t* date of birth\n\t* country of birth\n\t* identifying information, such as Alien Registration Number, Social Security Number, IRS Tax Number, etc. mailing address\n\t* physical address\n5. Pay a fee. You have to pay a $405 filing fee. Make your check or money order payable to \u201cU.S. Department of Homeland Security.\u201d Don\u2019t use abbreviations like \u201cDHS\u201d or \u201cUSDHS.\u201d\n\t* Fees are subject to change. You should call 1-800-375-5283 for updated fee information.\n6. Submit your application to the appropriate address. Make a copy of your complete application for your records. Then put your application in a secure envelope and mail it to the appropriate address. You can get the appropriate address by calling the National Customer Service Center at 1-800-375-5283. USCIS might contact you for more information. Please provide requested information promptly.\n\n\n## Obtain a copy of the form i-140 petition\n\n1. Ask your employer for a copy. Your employer files a Form I-140 petition when they want to sponsor you as an immigrant worker. Filing the form is necessary so that you can become a legal permanent resident in the U.S. and work here. Because your employer submitted this petition, you should ask them for a copy. Sometimes, however, your employer won\u2019t give you a copy of the petition. In this situation, you will need to file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Only submit an FOIA request if the petition has been approved. You cannot request a copy of a petition that is under consideration. Instead, call 1-800-375-5283 for inquiries about the status of your application. You can also call the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office where the petition was filed.\n2. Download Form G-639. This is the Freedom of Information Act request form. You should download the form and its instructions. You can also get a copy of the form by calling 1-800-375-5283. You don\u2019t have to use the form. However, all requests must be in writing, and using the form is probably easiest.\n3. Complete the form. Provide requested information by using a typewriter or writing clearly in black ink. If you need extra space to answer a question, then you can attach a sheet of paper. Make sure to put your name and Alien Registration Number (if applicable) at the top of each sheet. Also clearly identify the page number, part, and item number your additional information refers to. If a question doesn\u2019t apply to you, then write \u201cN/A\u201d or \u201cnot applicable\u201d in the space. Don\u2019t just leave it blank. Make a copy of the form for your records.\n4. Verify your identity. You will need to sign the form under penalty of perjury or in front of a notary public. You can find notaries in courthouses, town offices, and most large banks. Take acceptable forms of identification (such as a valid state-issued ID or passport) with you to the notary. If you are requesting a copy of someone else\u2019s Form I-140, then you must get his or her permission. Typically, getting them to sign this form is sufficient.\n5. Explain why you need the request expedited. Generally, it can take USCIS a month to process your request. However, you can request that USCIS speed up the process if you have a valid reason. For example, you might be in removal proceedings. If you are, then you should make a copy of your Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing. You will need to submit these documents with your FOIA request. Also write a letter explaining in detail why you urgently need the information. You need to sign the letter under penalty of perjury. Include the following words above your signature: \u201cThe information contained in this letter is complete, true, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\u201d\n6. Pay a fee, if required. You typically won\u2019t have to pay a fee. You get the first 100 pages (and 2 hours of search time) free. Because your Form I-140 is not 100 pages, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay anything. However, you might have to pay a fee if you order in bulk. For example, you might be an employer getting copies of your employees\u2019 forms. In this situation, you have to pay ten cents per page. You won\u2019t be billed until you have accrued at least $14 in charges. By submitting the form, you agree to pay at least $25 in fees.\n7. Submit your request. Gather all of your documents and make a copy for your own records. You can submit your request using one of these three different methods:\n\t* Fax: send it to (816) 350-5785. Email: send the completed form and supporting documents as attachments to uscis.foia@uscis.dhs.gov. Mail: send your request certified mail, return receipt requested to National Records Center (NRC), FOIA/PA Office, PO Box 648010, Lee\u2019s Summit, MO 64064-8010.\n8. Provide additional information. USCIS might contact you and request additional information in order to process your request.

{"conversations": ["How to help an older dog grieve the loss of its owner?", "## Comfort the dog\n\n1. Spend extra time with the dog. A dog in mourning may need extra love and attention. Try to increase the amount of time you spend with the dog. You might spend twenty extra minutes in the morning and evening to help give the dog support while they are grieving the death of their owner. During this time, you can:\n\t* Talk to the dog\n\t* Walk the dog\n\t* \n\t* Groom the dog\n\t* \n\t* Go on a car ride\n\t* Visit the dog park\n\t* Pick out a new toy together at the pet store\n\t* Cuddle the dog on the couch or in bed\n\t* Take the dog for a run, if the dog is healthy enough\n\t* Play a game, like fetch or tug-of-war\n2. Pet the dog. Touch increases the bond between dogs and people. Extra cuddling, petting, and brushing can improve the dog\u2019s mood and distract them from the loss of their owner. As you spend time with the dog, rub their belly or scratch their ears. Give them a little extra grooming time each week. This will help you bond and comfort the dog.\n3. Play their favorite games. Playtime can distract the dog from the loss of their owner. The extra exercise can also boost their mood and decrease the likelihood of grief-related health issues. Try to identify the dog\u2019s favorite games or toys, and spend extra time playing with them. Some older dogs may not want to play as much. Each dog is different. If the dog is uninterested in playing, you might try another way of distracting them. You can also give the dog new and interesting toys. Food puzzle toys can help keep the dog busy while you are not home, reducing the dog\u2019s separation anxiety.\n4. Invite company over. The dog may appreciate having people over to spend time with. Invite a few friends over, and see how the dog reacts. If the dog enjoys the company and socializes with the people, you may want to keep it up. If the dog avoids your guests, you should respect their space. Inviting people or dogs that the dog already knows may cheer the dog up. It can also introduce an element of familiarity in their new life. If the people are total strangers to the dog, invite one or two over at a time to see how well the dog handles it.\n\n\n## Monitor the dog\u2019s health\n\n1. Identify physical symptoms of mourning. Dogs mourn differently from humans. While some dogs may not mourn at all, others will become extremely clingy, anxious, or lethargic. Keep an eye out for the following symptoms. If they do not disappear after a few days, you might consider seeking help from a vet or dog behaviorist. Lethargy or lack of energy. Lack of interest in playing\n\t* Loss of appetite\n\t* \n\t* Unsociable behavior\n\t* Increased sleeping\n\t* \n\t* Weight loss\n\t* Decline in physical health\n2. Encourage the dog to eat. It is very common for older dogs to stop eating after the loss of their owner. This can cause other health issues to develop. If the dog seems to have stopped eating, you should try to get the dog to eat. If possible, keep feeding the dog the same food that the old owner fed them. You can also give the dog kibble in a kong-type dog toy or food puzzle. The dog may enjoy trying to get the food out of the toy. Add a little warm chicken broth to the dog\u2019s dry food to make it softer and more enticing. While a few extra treats here and there may not be detrimental to your dog, you should avoid giving the dog too many treats during this period. They may learn that they will be rewarded for whining, and they may not eat their normal food.\n3. Take the dog on walks. Older dogs may not be extremely active to begin with, but they may become more lethargic after the loss of their owner. Such inactivity can lead to further health problems. If the dog is able, take them on a walk at least once or twice a day. Depending on the age and health of the dog, these may be short walks. You can make even short walks more mentally stimulating for the dog by walking in areas with lots of interesting sights, sounds, and smells. For example, you might take your dog to the park, through the woods, or some place with water.\n4. Take the dog to the vet. If the dog continues to mourn for several weeks or if the dog is not eating, you should visit the vet to make sure that the dog is still in good health. The vet can diagnose an underlying medical problem or prescribe medication to help with the dog's anxiety or depression. While at the vet, you might ask:\n\t* \"What medical issues does this dog have? Can any of them be aggravated by the loss of their owner?\" \"The dog seems really depressed. What can I do to help?\" \"The dog has been sleeping a lot since I took them in. Is this because the dog is depressed or is there another issue?\" \"The dog has not been eating since their owner died. What can I do to encourage them to eat?\" If you know which vet the dog's old owner used, you should take them there. The vet can inform you of the dog's medical history.\n\n\n## Provide a happy home\n\n1. Maintain a routine. For the first few days after the owner has died, it is important to maintain the dog\u2019s routine as much as possible. Older dogs tend not to do well with new habits, schedules, or activities, and the owner\u2019s death may have already disrupted their life. Try to feed and walk the dog at the same times as the old owner did. If you can, reach out to people who knew the dog when it was with the old owner, and see if they have an idea of what the dog\u2019s former routine was like. If you do not know what schedule the old owner kept, you can develop a new schedule for the dog. Keep a consistent routine for the first few weeks that the dog joins you. The dog may also prompt you when they expect to be fed or taken outside. If there has been upheaval in the dog\u2019s life since the owner died (for example, if the dog has been passed around by family members or if you adopted the dog from a shelter), setting a routine will be even more important for the dog. Make sure that you stick to the schedule to help the dog ease into their new home life. Be careful not to let the dog fall into bad habits due to grief. For example, if the dog turns up its nose at food, just let the food sit there until the dog is ready to eat it. Don\u2019t \u201creward\u201d the behavior by making a fuss.\n2. Take care of your own grief. If you knew the old owner, you may be grieving yourself. This is understandable. Do what you have to so that you can grieve in your own, personal way. This will in turn help the dog by providing a loving, happy home for them. Avoid mourning in front of the dog. Dogs are very sensitive to grief, and they may exhibit signs of mourning if they understand that you are grieving. While it is okay to cry a little in front of the dog, you may want to step into another room to mourn privately.\n3. Reinforce positive behavior. During this time, you may notice that the dog is whining, crying, or acting out. While you may want to give the dog a treat during these episodes, you should avoid rewarding them for this behavior. The dog may learn that they will earn treats if they whine. Instead, reward the dog when they are being good, such as when they are quietly resting. For example, you may notice that the dog is sitting outside of your bedroom door at night and whining. Instead of waking up to comfort the dog, go back to sleep. In the morning, you can pet and talk to the dog. If they are well-behaved, give them a treat with their breakfast. Good times to treat the dog are when the dog is resting quietly, when the dog is sitting with you, or right before you leave the house.\n4. Weigh the pros and cons of getting a new dog. While a new dog companion might provide company for the dog, many older dogs do not do well with a new younger dog in the house. While some older dogs may enjoy having a puppy around, others may snap at the younger dog or bully them. Consider carefully whether a new dog is appropriate for the older dog. Also keep in mind that bringing in a new companion for the dog will not make them miss their old owner any less. If a friend or family member has a puppy, ask if they can be introduced to your older dog. This will show you how well the dog deals with energetic puppies. If the older dog plays, cuddles, or gets along with the puppy, you might consider getting a younger dog. Try taking the dog to a dog park when it\u2019s not too crowded, and see if the dog seems to enjoy being around other dogs. If so, then you might consider bringing home a new dog. Another option is to adopt an older or senior dog. Try to find one with a similar temperament. See if the dogs can meet first before you adopt to see if they are friendly with one another.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A compassionate pet owner or animal lover who has recently experienced the loss of an older dog and is seeking guidance to support their pet through this difficult time.

{"conversations": ["How to host a sleepover party for a wide range of ages?", "If you are throwing a sleepover with guests with ages ranging from seven to twelve (e.g. you are having all your cousins round), it can be tough finding activities to suit everyone. Here are a few games and other activities that will make a wide age ranged sleepover a success.\n\n## Be prepare\n\n1. Before the sleepover you should have a list of \"back up ideas\" for if your sleepover dips. It can happen in the best of sleepovers. One minute, everyone can be having great fun and then the next everyone's arguing or someone starts missing home. For these occasions, you should have a list of back ups that will bring the mood up again. The activities should be fun and not very competitive like hide and seek or just chilling and watching a movie. However if you are going to be playing team games make sure you don't put people who are arguing on the same team.\n2. Get to know your guests. You probably already know a lot about them but if you don't you should find out. It just makes it a lot easier to choose: food, drinks, activities, themes and lots more.\n3. Before the sleepover, you should also decide wether or not to have a theme. Themes can be fun and make your party that tiny bit of extra fun but they can also limit your choices. If you are going to choose a theme then make sure that it suits everyone. For example, if you are doing a princess theme don't have one person not dressed up and left out because they don't really like princesses you either have to rethink the theme or rethink inviting that person. Some theme ideas are:\n\t* princess\n\t* disney\n\t* under the sea\n\t* safari\n\t* a color\n\t* christmas\n\t* Hawaii\n\t* Halloween\n\t* a book you all like\n\t* a TV show or movie you all like\n\t* sporty\n\n\n## Food\n\n1. Since it's a sleepover, you should go all out on the sweets and drinks. Sugary stuff is great, but remember to have other options e.g. pizza, crackers or even fruit because sometimes at 3:00am you might not feel like chocolate or other sugary foods. Remember to check if your guests are vegetarian or vegan or have allergies because a trip to the hospital at 2:00am because Molly ate a Snickers when she has nut allergies will definitely put a damper on the night.\n2. For drinks, make sure you have lots of fizzy juice, try and get stuff you might not normally buy because it is a sleepover. For example maybe if you see some blueberry fizzy juice at your local super market. Even if you all hate it, it could still come in handy for penalties in truth of dare. Once again remember to check if your guests have allergies.\n\n\n## When to go to bed\n\n1. At a sleepover the time you go to bed and the time you fall asleep are two very different times. If there are younger kids (6-7 years old) maybe pulling an allnighter isn't the best idea because it will be you who puts up with the temper tantrums the next day.\n2. Everyones different but it probably isn't a good idea to make younger kids go to bed earlier than the older kids because they will be to anxious about thinking about what they are missing to sleep.\n3. A good idea is to watch a movie while in bed then the younger ones might doze off if it's late (some of the older kids might as well) and then the kids who are still awake can talk or play a quiet game.\n\n\n## Game\n\n1. It can be tough finding games that will suit all age groups because what a 7 year old would find fun a 12 year old probably won't, but there are ways of modifying games so that everyone has a good time.\n2. Murder in the Dark is a very good classic sleepover game and its bundles of fun.There are many different ways of playing but this way is my favorite. Before your guests arrive, cut out cards that are all the same size (one for each guest e.g. if there are 5 people coming make 5 cards) write murderer on one and detective on another and suspect on the rest. If there are children coming who can't read/are not confident readers draw a shape beside each one and for example say - if you have a square on your card you are the murderer. Everyone keeps their card a secret. The lights go out and if you are the murderer you have to tap people and they have to scream and fall over however if you are the detective and you get tapped you have to put the lights on and try and guess you the murderer is. If they guess right they win but if they don't the murderer wins.\n3. Hide and Seek in the dark is another good game.\n4. If you and your guests like making movies then go for it. There are loads of great apps that can help you with that and they are a great way to remember your sleepover.\n5. Make friendship bracelets.\n6. Build a den. Indoor or outdoor dens/forts are great fun to make and fun to hide out in. They are also great because all kids from 7 to 12 mostly like making dens so its something everyone can join in with.\n7. Pillow fights are also great just make sure the pillows don't have any hard zips or anything on them.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A parent or guardian who is planning a sleepover party for their child and their friends, ranging in age from pre-teens to teenagers.

{"conversations": ["How to eat to slow down bone loss in menopause?", "Your bones reach their peak bone mass level when you are in your 30s, and then bone mass starts to decline. For women approaching menopause, bone loss is an even bigger concern because bone cell regeneration begins to slow around this time. However, there are steps that you can take to prevent bone loss, including avoiding certain foods, eating calcium-rich foods, and taking other preventative measures like exercising and having a bone mineral density test. Learn how to eat to get the right blend of vitamins and minerals and reduce your chances of losing bone mass as you age.\n\n## Reduce bone loss with food choices\n\n1. Steer clear of soft drinks. Many carbonated beverages contain phosphoric acid, which can affect your body\u2019s ability to absorb calcium. Phosphoric acid causes you to lose calcium when you urinate. To reduce the calcium that you lose from drinking sodas, limit or avoid sodas altogether. Try drinking beverages that do not contain phosphoric acid, such as club soda, water, herbal teas, black or green teas, or fortified orange juice.\n2. Watch your sodium intake. Sodium is a major cause of calcium loss and a high-sodium diet has been linked with developing osteoporosis. The more sodium you have in your diet, the more calcium you will need to get in order to make up for it. Try to limit your sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day to help reduce your calcium loss.\n3. Limit caffeine. Caffeine also reduces your body\u2019s ability to absorb calcium, so it is important to keep your caffeine intake under control to prevent low calcium levels. If you want to eliminate bone loss from caffeine intake, you can switch to decaf or choose beverages that are naturally caffeine free, such as peppermint or chamomile tea. Try not to exceed 300 milligrams of caffeine per day. That\u2019s about the equivalent of 2 8 fl oz (240 mL) cups of coffee. Try switching to tea. It is lower in caffeine than coffee and has been shown to protect bones from calcium loss.\n4. Cook from scratch whenever possible. Food that is processed lacks trace minerals that have a protective effect on bones. To make sure that you are getting the most nutrient-dense diet possible, cook your meals from scratch whenever you can. Try choosing fresh instead of frozen or canned vegetables, make your own bread, cook whole grains such as brown rice, and avoid pre-packaged prepared foods.\n5. Choose quality proteins. Since bones are made up of mostly protein, getting enough of the right kind of protein is an important part of maintaining bone density. Try to avoid red meat as much as possible since it tends to be more acidic and may reduce the amount of calcium that your body can absorb. Make sure that you include enough quality protein sources for your size and gender to reduce bone loss. Good sources of protein include:\n\t* Eggs\n\t* Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt\n\t* Poultry, such as chicken and turkey\n\t* Seafood, such as salmon, halibut, and shrimp\n6. Skip the soy unless your doctor recommends it. Soy has been found to have adverse effects on the absorption of calcium as well, so it is best to avoid eating too much soy. Even if a soy product is fortified with calcium, your body won\u2019t absorb the calcium well. If you rely on soy as a primary source of protein, then it is a good idea to take a calcium supplement for extra protection. On the other hand, some studies have shown that eating soy-based foods may improve bone health overall and reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis. Talk to your doctor or a dietitian about whether you should incorporate soy into your diet.\n7. Eat sources of Vitamin K. There are 2 forms of vitamin K: K1(phylloquinone) and K2 (menaquinone). The combination is sometimes called MK7 in commercial supplement products. You should aim for about 250-1000 mcg of K1 and 45-180 mcg of K2 per day. Eat a good source of vitamin K 2 to 3 times a week to get these amounts or take a supplement. Natural food sources of vitamin K include:\n\t* Sauerkraut\n\t* Aged cheese\n\t* Natto (a soy product)\n\t* Kimchee (fermented Korean cabbage)\n\t* Beef liver\n\t* Green tea\n\t* Turnip greens\n\t* Broccoli\n\t* Kale\n\t* Spinach\n\t* Cabbage\n\t* Asparagus\n\t* Dark green lettuce\n\n\n## Get more calcium\n\n1. Drink and eat low-fat dairy products. Dairy products provide a significant amount of calcium, so make sure that you include 2 to 3 servings of dairy per day in order to get enough calcium. Since dairy products are naturally high in fat, it is a good idea to seek out low-fat and fat free dairy products. Milk has long been known as a good source of calcium and it should be a staple in your diet if you are trying to avoid bone loss. Drink 2 to 3 glasses of low-fat or non-fat milk per day. Cheese and yogurt are also good sources calcium, although they do not contain as much calcium as milk does. Choose low-fat cheese and yogurt to reduce your intake of unhealthy fats.\n2. Include canned sardines and salmon in your diet. Certain canned fish, such as sardines and salmon, are also good sources of calcium, as long as you eat the bones. The fish bones tend to be softer in canned fish, so they are edible. When eaten fresh, certain types of fish are good sources of vitamin D as well. For example, salmon, tuna, and mackerel are good sources of vitamin D.\n3. Have some leafy greens. Leafy greens such as kale, Chinese cabbage, turnip greens, and collard greens are also good sources of calcium. Try saut\u00e9ing some greens, adding them to a soup, or using them in place of your usual salad greens.\n4. Choose calcium-fortified orange juice. Drinking orange juice that has been fortified with calcium may also help you to prevent bone loss. Choose fortified orange juice as well as other types of fortified beverages to get a little more calcium in your diet.\n5. Take a supplement that contains calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. To ensure that you are getting enough calcium in your diet every day, take a supplement that contains calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. To help prevent bone loss, it is crucial to get enough magnesium and vitamin D along with calcium. It may be easier for your body to absorb calcium if you take it in smaller doses with meals (500 mg at a time). However, it is possible to get too much calcium, so talk to your doctor about the best amount and type of calcium supplement for you.\n\n\n## Take other step\n\n1. Get regular exercise. Performing regular weight-bearing exercise is a good way to build bone mass and prevent bone loss as well. Weight-bearing exercises include walking, dancing, jogging, and dancing. Non-weight bearing exercises include biking and swimming. Try going for a 30-minute walk most days of the week to get in some weigh-bearing exercise and help prevent bone loss.\n2. Spend time in the sun. The best way to get your daily dose of vitamin D is to spend about 15\u201320 minutes in the sun without sunblock every day. Exposure to the sun allows your body to produce its own vitamin D. Since this may not always be possible, especially during the winter in some places, supplementing with vitamin D is still advised.\n3. Get tested for osteoporosis. One serious problem with osteoporosis is that it can be symptomless. Many women will not know that they have osteoporosis until after a bone fracture. That is why it is a good idea to have a bone mineral density (BMD) test if you are at risk of osteoporosis. This test is often called a DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) and can help your healthcare professional to diagnose osteoporosis. Women over the age of 65 are at higher risk of developing osteoporosis, but other women under the age of 65 may be affected as well. Ask your doctor about getting a DEXA scan if you have:\n\t* Broken a bone from doing something that should not have caused a broken bone, like falling from a standing position\n\t* A chronic condition such as rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, or an eating disorder\n\t* Early onset menopause\n\t* Undergone hormone treatments, such as for prostate or breast cancer\n\t* Lost a noticeable amount of height\n\t* A history of smoking or currently smoke\n\t* Family members who have had osteoporosis\n\t* Been taking certain medications, such as corticosteroid or thyroid hormone replacement medications\n\t* A tendency to drink 3 or more alcoholic beverages most days\n4. Learn your T-score and Z-score. The results of a DEXA scan are known as a \u201cT-score\u201d and a \u201cZ-score,\u201d though for most people, the T-score is most important. In both the T-scores and the Z-scores, a negative number indicates that your bones are thinner or more porous than they should be. A higher negative number means that you have a higher risk of a bone fracture. If your T-score is between 0 and -1.0, this is considered normal. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 indicates that you have early osteoporosis, known as osteopenia. A T-score of less than -2.5 indicates osteoporosis.\n\n\n## When to seek medical treatment\n\n1. See your doctor if you have symptoms of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis doesn\u2019t always have symptoms, especially in its early stages. However, there are some signs and symptoms you can look out for if you\u2019re going through menopause or have other risk factors for osteoporosis. Call your doctor right away if:You\u2019ve recently fractured a bone, especially if the fracture happened more easily than expected\n\t* You are experiencing frequent back pain\n\t* You notice your posture becoming stooped\n\t* You\u2019re not as tall as you used to be\n2. Ask your doctor about medical treatment or prevention options. Diet and lifestyle changes can help prevent or slow bone loss associated with menopause, but there are also medical options.

It is considered to be a survival horror video game in which your character must solve different puzzles and psychological challenges in order to advance. The Shakespeare puzzle can be found during the Shopping Center stage. It\u2019s inside a bookstore called My Bestsellers.\n\n## Solve the puzzle on easy mode\n\n1. Pick up the Shakespeare books that have fallen on the ground. In this difficulty, there will only be 2 books on the ground: Anthology 1 and Anthology 3.\n2. Examine the bookshelf. You\u2019ll be allowed to place the books you found on the floor in the empty slots.\n3. Click on Anthology 1 and place it on the first slot of the bookshelf.\n4. Click on Anthology 3 and place it on the third slot on the bookshelf. A code will appear after placing the two books correctly.\n5. Use the code on the door at the back side of the bookstore. In this puzzle, you only need to arrange the books in the proper order: (from left to right) Anthology 1, Anthology 2, Anthology 3, Anthology 4, and then Anthology 5.\n\n\n## Solve the puzzle on normal mode\n\n1. Read the note on the door. It will read \u201cFair is foul, and foul is fair. Put these books out of order.\u201d\n2. Pick up all the books on the floor. There will be 5 books in normal mode.\n3. Examine the bookshelf. You\u2019ll be allowed to place the books on the empty space on the shelf. Put the books in randomly; order doesn\u2019t matter as this puzzle is generated randomly.\n4. Take a good look at the books. You\u2019ll see there are black markings on it; this is the code you need.\n5. Arrange the books until you get the correct order. It won\u2019t be too hard as the numbers are written quite obviously. Try to make out the numbers written on the spine of the books and keep moving them until you get it right.\n\n\n## Solve the puzzle on hard mode\n\n1. Know the title of each anthology book. In order to find the title of the book, you\u2019ll need to open your inventory and choose to examine the book. Anthology 1 is Romeo and Juliet\n\t* Anthology 2 is King Lear\n\t* Anthology 3 is Macbeth\n\t* Anthology 4 is Hamlet\n\t* Anthology 5 is Othello\n2. Decipher the first stanza of the clue. This stanza mentions \u201cThe first words at thy left hand.\u201d\n\t* This is an instruction for solving the puzzle; meaning you\u2019ll need to arrange the books from left to right.\n3. Place Anthology 4 on the first spot on the left side of the bookshelf. The first stanza mentions \u201cfalse lunacy\u201d and \u201cincomprehensible words,\u201d which is a reference to the plot of Hamlet.\n4. Place Anthology 1 on the second spot of the bookshelf. The second stanza is the easiest to decipher \u201cplaying at death\u201d and \u201cnameless lover\u201d refers to the last part of Romeo and Juliet.\n5. Place Anthology 5 on the third spot on the bookshelf. This stanza is a reference to Othello, referring to the innocence of Desdemona and the lies of Iago.\n6. Place Anthology 2 on the fourth spot on the bookshelf. This stanza refers to the story of King Lear, where his daughter Cordelia refuses to speak about how much she loves her father as opposed to the false flattery of her sisters.\n7. Place Anthology 3 on the last spot on the bookshelf. And with all 5 books on the bookshelf you would have the correct code.\n8. Decipher the last clue. 41523 is not the pass code; on the sixth stanza, you will be instructed to more. \u201c41523\u2014One vengeful man spilled blood for two\u201d (Hamlet). This means you will have to double Hamlet, which is Anthology 4. Now our code is 81523. \u201c81523\u2014Two youths shed tears for 3\u201d; this refers to Romeo and Juliet, so you must replace 1 with 3. Our code now is 83523. Finally, \u201c3 witches disappear\u201d (reference to Macbeth), which is Anthology 3. You\u2019ll have to remove it from the code. The final pass code is 8352.\n9.

{"conversations": ["How to treat ocd and anxiety as a workaholic?", "Working too much is a serious problem. Often, people who work too much also suffer from OCD or related anxiety disorders. If you work too much and suffer from an anxiety disorder, there are several things you can do to lead a more balanced life. You can start by seeing your doctor and going to therapy. Lifestyle changes, such as adopting stress-relieving techniques, making work boundaries, and managing your anxiety or OCD, are also important.\n\n## Manage your anxiety disorder\n\n1. Make a self-care plan. To improve your relationship with work and alleviate anxiety or OCD symptoms, you can develop a self-care plan that covers every area of your life. If you are obsessed with working, the rest of your life may be neglected. A self-care plan helps you balance your life and pay attention to each part of your life. Your self-care plan can focus on work, relationships, leisure time, the self, and your spiritual life. By breaking down your life into concrete categories, you can see where you are lacking and what needs improvement. For example, you may have 90% of your energy into your work. Your self-care plan allows you to schedule an hour each evening for leisure, where you watch television, an hour of exercise to focus on yourself, and two hours to spend with your family. On the weekends, you spend Saturday with your family and friends, and Sunday you focus on yourself. Start working on balancing your life. All of your energy now is focused on work. You should think about what\u2019s important to you, like family and friend relationships or improving your leisure time. Put more effort into those areas of your life and less into work. Becoming more balanced in your life, improving relationships, and working on yourself can help reduce stress that leads to anxiety and OCD.\n2. Get enough sleep. Many people who work all of the time don\u2019t sleep enough because they are too busy working. This can worsen anxiety and OCD symptoms, making you feel even worse. Worsening anxiety and OCD symptoms may also affect your work quality. To help with this, strive to get into a healthy sleep routine. Most people need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. You should go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning. This helps you adopt healthy sleeping habits.\n3. Take stress-relief breaks during the day. If you are spending all of your time focusing on work, your stress levels may be extremely high. This can increase your anxiety or OCD symptoms. To help alleviate your anxiety, take small breaks from work throughout the day to relieve stress. For example, take a 10 minute walk around the building or block. Exercise can help boost your mood and improve your anxiety. Go to lunch with coworkers or friends. Spending time connecting with people can help reduce anxiety and OCD symptoms.\n4. Engage in stress-relief techniques. When your anxiety or OCD symptoms get too bad because you are not working, you may need to use stress-relieving techniques to alleviate the symptoms. At first, you may even experience anxiety attacks as you fight compulsions or obsessive thoughts about working. Try deep breathing to help relieve anxiety. Whenever you feel overwhelmed by anxiety or OCD symptoms when you aren\u2019t working, take a deep breath through your nose as you count to five. Hold it for a count of five, then exhale through your mouth for a count of five. Regular exercise is a great way to treat anxiety and OCD symptoms. A thirty minute walk each day can reduce your symptoms. Try getting active each day, or try stress-relieving exercises such as yoga or tai chi.\n5. Meditate. One good way to learn how to calm down and let go of work is to meditate. Meditation helps you learn how to clear your mind so you can reduce stress. Mediation is also a good treatment for anxiety and OCD. Mediation helps you get rid of negative thoughts, stress, guilt, and anxiety. Meditation may also help you be able to control compulsions and obsessive thoughts. Guided meditation is a good starting place if you\u2019ve never meditated before. Guided meditation walks you through the process, so you are coached to relaxation and towards your mental goals.\n6. Develop hobbies. When you work too much, you may begin to lose yourself and forget to focus on anything that is enjoyable or enriching in your life. To help work on your sense of self, revisit old hobbies or develop new interests that have nothing to do with work. At first, you may have to tell yourself that spending time not working is okay. Remind yourself, \u201cSpending time engaging in hobbies helps me be a healthier, happier person. I have completed my work and I deserve something good.\u201d\n\n\n## Seek medical treatment\n\n1. See your doctor for a diagnosis and to begin treatment. To get proper treatment for your anxiety disorder or OCD, you need to get a proper diagnosis for both conditions. Anxiety disorders and OCD are serious mental illnesses that should be treated by a doctor or a therapist. If you work too much and you also suffer from anxiety or OCD, then your symptoms may be even more pronounced. However, with proper treatment, you can alleviate your symptoms and live a healthier life. Your doctor may suggest medication to treat the anxiety and OCD symptoms. Psychotherapy is also a common treatment for anxiety disorders. Your doctor will probably refer you to a psychiatrist or therapist who can provide therapy to address your anxiety disorder, OCD, and addiction-like behaviors. To find a therapist, start by asking your doctor for a referral. You can also search online for therapists in your area who specialize in your disorder. When you search online, you can also read reviews and patient experiences with the therapist.\n2. Undergo cognitive behavioral therapy. One effective treatment for anxiety and OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on changing negative thought patterns into healthier ones. This can also help change your attitude about work, along with helping you cope with obsessive and anxious thoughts and compulsions. You may have unhealthy or untrue beliefs about work. A therapist can help you work through these beliefs and modify them into healthier, more productive beliefs. For example, if you believe you will lose your job if you don\u2019t work all the time, your therapist can use CBT to help you change that thought to something like, \u201cI can work hard for this many hours each week and keep my job.\u201d\n3. Go to family therapy. Family therapy may be needed if working too much and having anxiety has negatively affected your family relationships. During family relationships, a therapist can help you learn how to interact with your family and make them a priority in your life. Your therapist can also help you figure out activities that you and your family can do together. These activities can strengthen your relationship and help you alter your attention away from work and onto leisure activity and relationships. You and your family can use therapy to learn how to communicate with each other. You may also be able to be truthful about ways your behavior has hurt each other. For example, your partner may say, \"I feel hurt that we never take any vacations because you are always working.\" You might say, \"I am frustrated because you get angry when I check my work e-mail in the evenings.\"\n\n\n## Establish work-related boundaries\n\n1. Leave work at work. When you leave work, you should do just that - leave work behind. Try not to take work home with you. Focusing on work at home can increase your anxiety and OCD symptoms while feeding your need to work. Try to make a clear boundary between work time and time not at work. For example, you can decide not to check your email or answer your phone when you\u2019re at home. Leave all paperwork and projects at work. Don\u2019t bring them home with you. If you must answer emails or work on paperwork at night, set aside a designated half an hour or hour to do just that. This helps keep your work time separate from your home time. It also keeps you from doing work all night.\n2. Talk to your boss about work boundaries. If working too much is triggering your anxiety or OCD, then you may want to talk to your boss about setting boundaries. You should tell our boss that you need to make clear boundaries about when you work and when you won\u2019t work. This may include what you will and won\u2019t do when you\u2019re off the clock. If you are an hourly worker, you may tell your boss that you will only work during your required hours. If your boss wants you to work outside of those hours, you may negotiate overtime or say no. If you are salaried, you may set a limit on the amount of hours you will work and discuss this with your boss. You may want to say, \u201cI have been working too much and spreading myself too thin. I would like to set some boundaries in relation to the hours I work.\u201d\n3. Change your thoughts about work. If you have anxiety and OCD, you may be plagued by inaccurate thoughts or obsessions. You may believe if you don\u2019t work all the time you will lose your job. You may have the compulsion to work constantly and get edgy or irritated if you are unable to work. To help treat your anxiety and OCD symptoms, work on changing your thoughts about work. Start by telling yourself that being away from work doesn\u2019t make you lazy or unproductive. Repeat to yourself, \u201cI do not have to work every hour of every day. I can take time to focus on myself and relationships.\u201d\n\t* Face your obsessive or anxious thoughts. When you start to feel anxious because you aren\u2019t working, tell yourself, \u201cNothing bad will happen if I am not working. These are just my anxieties. I deserve to take a break from work.\u201d\n4. Prioritize your to-do list. Due to your anxiety, you may have a long to-do list with things you must get done. Maybe you have obsessive thoughts about what will happen if you don\u2019t complete everything, or you have the compulsion to keep working until you have completed everything on the list. This is not healthy and just feeds anxiety and stress. Instead, start prioritizing the things you have to do and limiting your to-do list. For example, honestly assess everything on your list. What are things that have to get done today? What things have to be done by the end of the week? What things have no time limit on them? You may have to finish paperwork for work by the end of the day, complete a project by the end of the week, but making fliers can be done when you get to them. Limit your tasks to around five per day. If you have to add something to your task list for that day, you need to remove one task. Keep yourself limited so you don\u2019t overextend yourself.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A high-achieving professional, possibly in their late 20s to early 40s, struggling with symptoms of OCD and anxiety, exacerbated by their demanding work schedule.

{"conversations": ["How to have a romantic relationship with an egotistic person?", "An egotistic person can be someone who is prone to talking about themselves frequently, or someone who appears vain or boastful. It can also be used to indicate someone who is opinionated, self-centered, or selfish, as well. As you can imagine, being in a relationship with an egotistic person can have its challenges. If you feel you are dating an egotistic individual, work towards dealing with the egotism in the relationship. It is also important to communicate your needs to your partner, and make sure you are taking care of yourself\n\n## Deal with the egotism in the relationship\n\n1. Have a direct conversation about it. This is important and has a direct effect on your happiness, their happiness, and the success of the relationship. Don't waste time and energy trying indirect ways to \u201cmake her change.\u201d It will just come across as manipulative and potentially cause resentment from your partner. Instead have a real, honest, and direct conversation about it. Start by letting her know you need to talk. \u201dAlice, I think we really need to talk. There's been something that has really be bothering me.\u201d\n\t* Explain what the issue is for you; specific to your relationship. For example, if your partner is selfish or egotistical in conversations and making it about her, you could say, \u201cI feel like when we talk, it isn't really equal. I love hearing about your day, but I'd really like for you to hear about my day too. When we talk, it feels really unevenly focused.\u201d\n\t* Ask for her input: \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n2. Urge the person to grow and mature. One of the great things you get to do in a relationship is to build each other up and watch each other grow. Help your partner grow by growing with him. Instead of focusing just on the person, try shift the focus to the relationship or the both of you working on the same thing. You can try tasks like taking a relationship selfishness checklist test to increase your partner and your awareness of any selfishness in your relationship. Humans are social creatures and tend to unconsciously adopt the goals of those close to us. Just like couples who learn a sport, how to cook, or a new language together, you can learn how to be less selfish and opinionated together. Make sure to celebrate and praise each other for positive changes you are making. The better you both feel about it, the more likely you are to continue to work towards the goal.\n3. Be patient. This may be the most difficult part. If you are with an egotistic person, you may realize that changing these parts of yourself can take time. Much like breaking a bad habit, you may have to be patient with your partner as she works on changing. Additionally, expect some backsliding into previous bad behaviors during this transition time and try not to be too hard on her. One way you can address this is to have a funny thing you do or say if you notice your partner slipping back into her selfish habits. Agree to an action or a phrase during your conversation. If you make it something you both find funny, it can take the pressure off of pointing it out. The \"Cut it out\" hand motion Uncle Joey used in Full House. Playing a funny song such as Toby Keith's \"I wanna talk about me.\" Saying, \"Hold on, I haven't had enough coffee for this conversation yet.\" Pick something that is funny to you and your partner, like an inside joke that only you share.\n4. Boost the person's self-esteem. This may seem like a strange suggestion for an egotist, but often inflated egos and selfishness are rooted in low self-esteem or shame. Think of it as overcompensation. Your partner may have low self esteem causing him to exaggerate and inflate his outward display of what he thinks about himself. It turns out that he may be trying to convince himself of his greatness along with everyone else. Help him boost his self-esteem. Avoid complaining about him or harshly criticizing him as it will only make him feel more threatened. When you are talking to him focus on his strengths and try to draw on the potential of those strengths. Compliment him not just for his looks, but for how he acts and what he does.\n5. Accept that the person may never change. The most difficult part about any interpersonal relationship is when you realize that you have almost zero power to change someone else. People can change, but that change has to come mainly from them. They have to want it. So if you are intent on a relationship with an egotistic person, your first step is to be real with yourself about the likelihood of the other person changing and begin to accept the selfish parts of her personality that you may not agree with. While you cannot change other people, you can help them to change. You can also control how you react to their egotism and the effect you let it have on your life.\n\n\n## Communicate your need\n\n1. Make time to talk about you. Your egotist may tend to talk about themselves frequently and at great lengths. If you feel like your partner does not give you enough space to talk about you, address it. You deserve to have this relationship and this partner be as much of a sounding board as he expects you to be for him. Try addressing it directly, or making it more of a new pattern in your conversations. \"John, I really need to talk to you about something that is bothering me. I know you have things you want to say as well, but I really need someone to listen. Would you be willing to focus on just this problem and help me?\u201d\n\t* Bring up topics more regularly that you are interested it. You may have gotten into the habit of just listening to your partner and letting him control the conversations. Start a new pattern of conversation by interjecting with topics you are interested in or thoughts you are having.\n2. Share your feelings. There is a solid chance that your egotistic partner is going to do or say something that makes you angry or sad at some point, because what you are doing is difficult and can be frustrating. Communication is key in any relationship, especially when you are working through some things. If you are really bothered by a particular action of your partner or by something she said, tell her. Try to add a compliment or a praise in and then tell her what upsets you, carefully and tactfully. \"Jane, I love it when you teach me how to cook. You are really good at it, and I want to learn. It just really hurts me when you tell it to me like I'm a nine year old kid.\" \u201dI understand you have a very strong opinion about this. Maybe you know more about it than I do, too. I would just really like for you to respect my opinion even if it is different than yours and not laugh at me for sharing it with you.\u201d\n\n\n## Care for yourself\n\n1. Be true to yourself. Be careful not to change who you are in your relationship with an egotist. A selfish person will bring out the giver or the care-taker in you; which could be potentially harmful. Don't feel like you have to change yourself to accommodate him. Resist the urge to stifle who you are or even what you are good at out of fear of how your partner will react. Just as you may have to accept that your partner is selfish, he have to accept that you are going to be just who you are as well. That should just be one more thing he loves about you.\n2. Enjoy other interests. If you find you are the giver in the relationship and you feel that your partner is always taking, then invest some of your energy into other interests to protect yourself from the relationship imbalance. Make sure you are giving yourself and your interests the attention and care you deserve. Take classes or carve out time in your schedule to do things that you enjoy, focusing on self-care and your own needs. You can always put your giving energy into volunteering as well. Try organizations such as Volunteer Match.\n3. Acknowledge your feelings. Even if your partner is trying to change, there are potential pitfalls that come from being in a relationship with an egotist. You may be helping her change, being patient while she works through some things, and trying to boost her self-esteem. Make sure, during this time, you are staying aware of how you feel. There may be some ups and down, and it is important you remain aware of how it is affecting you. Keep track of how happy you are in the relationship and how your day-to-day life is being affected. Notice how drained or exhausted you are feeling and make sure to give yourself the time and attention needed to recover. Try not to let this relationship become all-consuming for your life. Spend time with friends, or work on a hobby or interest that is important to you. Set firm boundaries if she tries to push your buttons or engage you in a fight. You can say something like, \"I'm not going to respond when you're yelling at me like this. I'm going to go in the other room and we can talk again in an hour when we've calmed down.\"\n4. Find a support system. While you are navigating this change together, it is important that you both have support systems you can use as a resource. Use your existing support system or create one for yourself. Focus on people that help you and make you feel good about yourself. They should be people that you trust and feel comfortable with. They may include:\n\t* Friends\n\t* Family\n\t* Religious Community\n\t* Counselors or therapists\n5. Consider leaving the relationship if it is not making you happy. It is not always a healthy idea to stay with an egotist. He may not be able or willing to change in the way you need him to. If he is not willing to work on the relationship then this may continue to make you feel emotionally drained and unappreciated. It may be better for you to leave the relationship and move onto something that's healthier for you.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A person who is seeking advice on navigating a complex romantic relationship, specifically with someone who exhibits signs of egotism.

There is Momma Mouse and Papa Mouse and their three children, Esther Mouse, Rosie Mouse, and Rachel Mouse. Every morning they walk to the edge of the woods.

They were very happy.\nOne day there was a visitor. It was a new creature with big teeth and a tail like a paddle. What could it be? This was Mr Beaver. He and Mrs Beaver had moved to the river nearby. They wanted to build a bridge. The mice were very excited. A bridge would be a fine thing indeed. That night Papa Mouse and Mr Beaver planned the bridge while Mrs Beaver taught the little mice how to swim. There was no lake to pratice in so the mice filled the washtub and carefully floated.\nSoon the building of the bridge started. It was going very well. In the early evenings the mice would use their bags to carry mud to make mice-sized bricks. Then one day they noticed that the bricks were melting! When the mud got too wet it just fell out of the bridge. What could be done?\nThe mice thought and thought. They added stones but it was too rough. They added grass but it was too slippery. Then one day Esther Mouse added some wheat leaves. They were dry and just right.\nThe bridge was quickly built and the mice visited their friends every day.\nThe End\n(P.S.

{"conversations": ["How to know if your girlfriend is ready to kiss you?", "Kissing a girl can be nerve-wracking, especially if you don't know if she's ready for a kiss! Luckily, there are ways you can figure out whether or not she wants a kiss. Although no tip is foolproof, at least you\u2019ll have a better idea of whether it\u2019s welcome before you make the move.\n\n## Study her face\n\n1. Watch her eyes. You should be able to tell a lot about your girlfriend's desire to kiss you from her eyes. They don't say the eyes are the windows to the soul for nothing. If she looks you directly in the eye, she is probably establishing intimacy and is at least open to kissing you. Although eye contact is almost always a positive sign, remember that sometimes people look down or away because they are shy or nervous. Still, if she is not looking at you, that's a warning sign that she's not open to a kiss. Women will give you more submissive looks in some cases when they want to be kissed, such putting the chin down and subtly looking down. Slightly narrowing the eyes is a pose that many women go into when they are waiting for a kiss. Are her pupils dilated and are her eyes widening? If so, these are signs that she is enjoying being around you, so she is probably open to a kiss.\n2. Look at her lips. Women prepare their lips for a kiss. So if you want to know if she wants to kiss you, zero in on her mouth. Is she biting her lip or licking her lips? These could be signs that she is trying to moisten them for a kiss. If she is pursing her lips or they look hardened, this is a bad sign. She is closing herself off to you. If she's applied lip gloss recently, or freshened her breath, this could mean she wants her lips to look desirable to you, in the hopes you will kiss them. This is especially true if you can tell she's reapplied them (say when you went to the bathroom). If she's looking at YOUR lips, it probably means she is thinking about kissing them.\n3. Pay attention to her nose. This might sound odd, but research has shown the nose can give away signals of desire - often without her realizing it. If her nostrils are flaring slightly, she probably wants a kiss. Physically, flaring the nostrils means she is taking in more air because she is preparing for physical activity. You need to take this one in context. If she's in the middle of an argument with you, the physical activity her body is preparing her for might not be in your favor.\n\n\n## Interpret her other body language\n\n1. Watch her posture. Posture can be very revealing. Much of communication is made up of non-verbal cues. Sometimes people don't even realize they are communicating this way. If she is learning into you or toward you, even slightly, it probably means she is more open to a kiss. On the other hand, if she is leaning away, that's a bad sign. You should also pay attention to the direction her feet are pointing. If they are pointing away from you, it could be a sign she is looking for a chance to leave. Does she move away when you move slightly toward her? This is a test you can use to measure her body language interest in kissing you. Subtly create more of a zone of intimacy and see if she complies or moves away to diminish it.\n2. Study her hands. Women will use their hands to touch things or show femininity if they want you to kiss them. If a woman plays with her necklace, she's probably into you. But you should take this act in context. If she also has other body language that is open to you, that's a better sign because sometimes a woman is just nervous. If a woman is playing with or twirling her hair, it's a sign she wants you to find her attractive and is flirting with you. If she touches something else, like a glass (running her fingers over it), in even a somewhat sensual way, that's a good sign.\n3. Wait for her touches. If she has touched you recently, even in small ways, this could be her way of creating more intimacy in the hopes you will kiss her. Even the slightest of touches show desire. That means it's a good sign if she brushes her hand against your knee or arm. Touch probably means she wants to get closer to you. It's an even better sign if she touches your face. If she softly, playfully hits you on the arm, she is trying to create a playful vibe with you, which is a way that women flirt. You could test her out by touching her slightly first to see how she responds. For example, brush your feet against hers under the table and see what she does. Another technique is to touch a piece of jewelry she has lightly (earrings, necklace), and say you admire it. If she smiles and is OK with you moving closer into her space, that's a good sign.\n4. Spot whether she has open body language. When taken together, is her body language closed or is it open? If she has open body language, she is not trying to erect barriers between you. Signs of open body language include arms at the side, body tilted toward you or facing you, eye contact, feet pointed toward you. Signs of closed body language include arms crossed over chest, feet or legs crossed, feet pointing away from you, body tilted away from you, and minimal eye contact. How much personal space is she leaving between you? If it's not much, she's already open to an intimate connection with you on some level. This is a good sign for you.\n\n\n## Learn other kiss trick\n\n1. Consider how she talks to you. Does she seem like she wants to keep the conversation going? It's a good sign for you if she does. Is she asking you a lot of questions? Are they deep and personal? If the answers are yes, she probably wants a more intimate connection with you. Are you making her laugh? Laughing at your jokes (especially if they are not very funny) is a way that women flirt. Is she trying to keep the conversation going by being the one to ask questions or lead or direct the conversation? That's a good sign. It's a bad sign if she lets the conversation wither into silence between you or you feel like you're doing all the heavy lifting to keep it going.\n2. Try the triangular kissing technique. There are some techniques you can use to build sexual tension, while monitoring how she responds and communicates back. Move close to her and touch her, either her hands or legs. Slow down your breathing and words. Look at her right eye. Hold the look for a few seconds, then move your gaze to her left eye. Pause again. Now, move your gaze and hold it on her mouth. She should be more receptive to a kiss (as long as she hasn't moved away!)\n3. Spot the window of opportunity. Women you've just met will often give you a short window of opportunity for a kiss. This can be a tricky balancing act. This will be easier if she's already your girlfriend because you will be able to spot the signs more readily. A woman you've just met is also testing you. You need to give her signs that you like her when she seems receptive to you, otherwise she may feel rejected or insecure and start to pull away and try to make you chase her. If you miss the window of opportunity, she may think you lack confidence or aren't interested in her. But if you try to kiss her before it opens, she might think you're boorish or too aggressive. So monitoring body language matters.\n4. Handle her moving away. You should always be prepared for the worst: What if you try to move closer or touch her slightly, and she moves away? Maybe she's just tired or not in a good mood. Who knows? You don't want to make it worse with a bad response. Timing is everything. Act like nothing has occurred. Basically, show that you're not thrown off. You could even make a confident quip about her being cute when she's shy. Don't act angry or insecure. That's not appealing to women. Maybe she's interested in you but just not ready for a kiss yet. In that case, you could work on building more common ground and intimacy- slowly. Abandon your idea for a kiss right now and instead focus on having a great conversation with her, and remember to throw in some compliments!

{"conversations": ["How to boost your diet with peanut butter powder?", "Powdered peanut butter is a versatile ingredient that you can use to add some nutty flavor to any dish. Its low caloric count and limited fat content make it an appealing option for those looking to lose a little weight. It is great for supplementing simple dishes like smoothies or oatmeal. You can also use it to make savory sauces, spreads, or peanut-flavored dishes. Finally, you can mix the powder into any baked good, from brownies to cupcakes and cookies, to add some peanut flavor.\n\n## Enhance your diet\n\n1. Reduce your caloric intake. The main appeal of peanut butter powder is its low calorie count. A tablespoon of powdered peanut butter has about 25 calories compared to the 96 calories in the same amount of regular peanut butter. It is a good option for those looking to lose some weight but still enjoy peanut flavor.\n2. Limit your fat intake. Another appealing feature of powdered peanut butter is its low fat content. 1 tablespoon contains less than 1 gram (0.035 oz) of fat, while the same amount of regular peanut butter has about 8 grams (0.3 oz) of fat. Note that the fat content of peanuts is mostly heart-healthy monounsaturated fats. A single serving of peanut butter powder is 2 tablespoons. One serving contains about 1.5 grams of fat.\n3. Add a little protein or fiber. Powdered peanut butter is great for adding protein and fiber nutrients without adding the extra fat \u2014 1 tablespoon offers 3 to 4 grams (0.11 to 0.14 oz) of protein and 1 gram (0.035 oz) of fiber. This is particularly important for things like baking where the extra fat can alter the finished product.\n\n\n## Supplement simple dish\n\n1. Add it to your smoothies. To add peanut flavor while limiting calories and fat, you can add a tablespoon or two of the powder to your favorite smoothie. For most recipes, about 2 tablespoons (12.28 g) of powder can substitute for 1 tablespoon (16 g) of traditional peanut butter. Besides its lower calorie count, powdered peanut butter also makes your smoothies smoother and less gritty. As a rule of thumb, add 1 tablespoon (6.14 g) of powdered peanut butter for every 1 cup (250 ml) of smoothie or shake\n2. Mix it into your oatmeal. Instead of adding a regular peanut butter, mix in a spoonful of powdered peanut butter to your bowl of oatmeal. You can stir it with the oats before you add your milk or water, or you can mix it in after your oats are cooked. Pair it with a banana, some dark chocolate, or some berries for a PB&J oatmeal. You can also add peanut butter powder to muesli, quinoa, and other grain-based dishes.\n3. Pour some into your yogurt or granola. If you are making a parfait, you can mix powdered peanut butter into the either the granola or the yogurt. To add some extra flavor to your yogurt, mix in a spoonful of the powder. You can also sprinkle on top of the granola. If you are making your own granola, you can mix in powdered peanut butter for some additional flavor.\n\n\n## Cook with peanut butter powder\n\n1. Use it to make a peanut sauce. You can add powdered peanut butter to any sauce recipe that calls for peanut butter. Simply rehydrate the powder by mixing it with water and then add it to your sauce. Be sure to follow the directions to get the correct amount of peanut powder for the sauce. As a rule of thumb, mixing 4 tablespoons (24.56 g) of peanut butter powder with 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) of water will give you 2 tablespoons (32 g) of rehydrated peanut butter.\n2. Add it to breading. To add some extra flavor to your breaded meats, try mixing some powdered peanut butter into your breading. Use your traditional breading recipe and simply mix in about 1/3 as much peanut butter powder as flour our breadcrumbs. You could try this breading on chicken cutlets or pork chops. Consider adding crushed red pepper flakes to the breading for a little extra spice.\n3. Get creative. You can use powdered peanut butter to add some extra flavor to snacks like popcorn or trail mixes. You can also sprinkle it on top of bananas, mix it with your cereal, or add it to pancake batter. If you think that a dish might benefit from some peanut flavor, give it a dash of powdered peanut butter. For example, with a little olive oil and a couple spoonfuls of powdered peanut butter, you can make peanut butter popcorn. For a sweeter treat, consider sprinkling peanut butter powder on top of kettle corn.\n\n\n## Add peanut butter powder to desserts\n\n1. Bake it into baked goods. If you want to give your desserts a little extra peanut flavor, consider adding some peanut butter powder. You can add it to any baked good by substituting peanut butter powder for 1/3 the amount of flour called for in the recipe. In addition, you can mix in a couple of tablespoons of the powder to any batter. If a recipe calls for 3 cups (375 g) of flour, use 1 cup (294.7 grams) of peanut butter powder and 2 cups (250 g) of flour. If you are making banana muffins, you might add 3 tablespoons (18.42 g) of peanut butter powder to the batter.\n2. Go gluten-free. If you have a gluten intolerance or suffer from celiac disease, you can use peanut butter powder to make a number of desserts that do not require flour. You can make gluten free peanut butter brownies. You can also make gluten-free peanut butter cookies in a matter of minutes.\n3. Make a peanut butter spread. You can make a peanut butter spread in no time using a little peanut butter powder and cream cheese. Simply mix 1 tablespoon (6.14 g) of powder with an 8-ounce (226.8 g) block of cream cheese. If the spread does not have the peanut flavor you want, add sprinkles of the powder and mix until it tastes the way you would like.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A health-conscious individual who is interested in finding creative ways to incorporate nutritious foods into their diet.

{"conversations": ["How to be creative when playing with your barbies?", "There are endless fun possibilities when it comes to playing with Barbies. If you need ideas for activities, consider doing things like creating a beach for Barbie, pretending she's a doctor to help sick patients, or hosting a fashion show to show off all of her clothing. You can also create things for Barbie, such as furniture to go in her house or new clothing for her to wear.\n\n## Do activities with barbie\n\n1. Create your own Barbie mansion to play house with Barbie. If you bought a playhouse just for Barbie, great! If not, empty a bookshelf or stack empty boxes on top of one another on their sides to create your own. You can fill it with furniture and have Barbie decorate her home, use her kitchen, lounge in her bedroom, or chat with friends in her living room. Have Barbie throw a dinner party in her home, inviting other dolls and eating great food. Barbie could host a sleepover at her house and watch a funny movie.\n2. Turn Barbie into a doctor to have her help patients. Pretend that Barbie is a doctor or nurse and create an office for her to see sick patients. Use other dolls or toys to be the sick patients, and have Barbie check their throat, ears, nose, temperature, and breathing to see if she can help them get better. Pretend Barbie is a surgeon and is operating on another doll to save its life, or have Barbie fix up another doll\u2019s broken arm or ankle.\n3. Take Barbie to the beach by playing in a sandy spot. Use an outdoor sandbox, sandy section of your yard, or build your own beach by pouring sand into a plastic tub indoors. Let Barbie relax on a towel under a beach umbrella in the sand while she reads a book or talks to a friend. Use a piece of fabric or a washcloth as Barbie\u2019s beach towel. Put Barbie in her bathing suit so she can soak up some sun. Create a beach umbrella using a decorative drink umbrella, or by cutting an umbrella shape out of paper and sticking a toothpick or pencil through the middle. Add a small tub of water next to the sand to create an \u201cocean.\u201d\n4. Send Barbie to the hair salon to fix up her hair. To smooth out any tangles in Barbie\u2019s hair, dip her hair in a mixture of fabric softener and water and then use a brush to brush out the tangles. Curl Barbie\u2019s hair using pipe cleaners and hot water, or dye her hair with food coloring mixed with water. To curl Barbie\u2019s hair, take small sections of her hair and roll each section up on a small piece of pipe cleaner, just as you would real hair curlers. Dip her hair in hot water and let it dry. Mix a drop or 2 of food coloring in a bowl of water before dipping Barbie\u2019s hair into the colored water. This works best if Barbie has blonde hair.\n5. Let Barbie be a teacher to teach other dolls new things. Set up a school room with rows of chairs and desks for the doll students to sit and learn, and have Barbie write lessons on a chalkboard to teach everyone things like math, science, or foreign languages. You can even create small books for everyone to read and learn from! Barbie doesn\u2019t just have to be a school teacher - have her teach other dolls how to ride a horse, how to make a cake, or how to swim. Tape a piece of paper up on the wall to use as the chalkboard. Make books by cutting paper into sections that are roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) wide and 2 in (5.1 cm) long. Fold these sections in half and add a staple right on the folded line.\n6. Have Barbie star in her own movie using a video camera or phone. This could be an action movie where Barbie is involved in a high-speed car chase, a romantic movie where Barbie falls in love with someone, or any other genre that you like. Use a phone or video camera to film each scene so you can watch it later on. Plan out each scene before filming, such as which props you\u2019ll need and what Barbie will say. Ask friends or family members to help you shoot the movie so that you can have more characters in it. For example, you could film the movie outside and pretend that Barbie is stuck on an island and needs to be rescued.\n7. Take Barbie on a road trip if she has her own car. Pack up Barbie\u2019s car with snacks, clothing, and any other gear she\u2019ll need for a road trip, or use your imagination and use a cardboard box as her car. Have Barbie travel from room to room, meeting new people and trying new things. Barbie could also travel by plane, bus, boat, bicycle, or train. For example, you could pretend that each room in your house is a different country, and Barbie takes a plane to France, Greece, and Japan to try out their food. Take Barbie on a road trip to go shopping, hear music, or experience a festival.\n8. Create a pool for Barbie using a sink or plastic container. Fill a bowl or plastic container with water and dress Barbie up in her swimsuit so that she can go swimming. Make sure Barbie is able to get wet before dipping her in the water, especially if she has a special hairdo. Have Barbie throw a pool party and invite her friends. Play music, have Barbie sit on a pool towel next to the pool, or let her practice doing fun dives into the water.\n9. Put on a fashion show using Barbie\u2019s clothing. Dress Barbie in fancy dresses, businesswoman attire, lounge wear, or in crazy costumes. Use the clothing you already have for Barbie, or create new clothing using materials around your house such as balloons, pieces of fabric, or old socks. Play music while putting on the fashion show so that Barbie can strut down the runway. For example, dress Barbie up like a princess, astronaut, ballerina, basketball player, or celebrity.\n\n\n## Make clothe and furniture for barbie\n\n1. Cut up balloons to make clothing for Barbie. Cut both ends of the balloon off using scissors to create a skirt or strapless dress, or design more detailed shirts and dresses by cutting arm holes into the balloon. Slide the balloon up over Barbie\u2019s body starting at her feet once you\u2019re done. The balloon should be deflated to use it as clothing.\n2. Create a dress out of a piece of fabric. Look around the house to find spare pieces of fabric used for sewing or projects. To make a super simple dress, cut a circle out of the fabric with a diameter of about 1 foot (30 cm). Cut a small hole for Barbie\u2019s head right in the middle, and then 2 arm holes on either side. Slide the dress over Barbie\u2019s head and use a ribbon or piece of string to tie it at the waist. Make sure the main hole in Barbie\u2019s dress is big enough for her head to fit through. Design more complicated pieces of clothing, such as pants or long-sleeve shirts, if desired.\n3. Cover sponges in fabric to create a comfy couch. Find pieces of fabric for sewing or crafts around the house and cut them into squares large enough to fit over the sponge, leaving 1 in (2.5 cm) of extra fabric on each side. You can either sew the fabric to create a cover for the sponge, or you can glue the fabric onto the sponge. Do this with at least 2 sponges and then place one flat on the ground with the other up against a wall as a backrest. For a super comfy couch, make the seat of the couch out of 2 sponges stacked on top of one another. To create a long sectional, use 4-6 sponges to form the couch.\n4. Stack empty matchboxes on top of one another to form drawers. You can color, paint, or cover the outside of the matchboxes with paper beforehand, if desired. Place the matchboxes on top of one another, adding drops of glue in between each layer to keep them all in place. Place Barbie\u2019s things, such as her hairbrush, phone, mirror, or books, in the drawers. If you only have one matchbox, prop the matchbox up on something like a piece of cardboard or paper clips and turn it into a one-drawer nightstand. Cover the new drawers with stickers, glitter, or pictures.\n5. Turn a shoebox into a bed for Barbie. Find an old shoebox from your closet, garage, or other storage spot and empty it out. Place a washcloth or small blanket inside, as well as something that will be used as a pillow. Now Barbie has a bed ready for sleeping! Create a pillow by stuffing a piece of fabric or a cloth bag with tissues or stuffing. Decorate the sides of the bed using markers, pencils, or paint.\n6. Tie ribbon onto a small hair band to make a tutu for Barbie. Find an extra hair tie and ribbon that you like. Cut the ribbon into 6 in (15 cm) sections, and then tie the ribbon onto the hair tie so that the middle of the ribbon is where the knot is. Do this all the way around the hair tie to create a fun tutu. Use different colored or patterned ribbon to make the tutu super colorful. If your hair tie is too big and won\u2019t fit Barbie, find a rubber band and cut it before tying a new knot to make it the perfect size.\n7. Design chairs using cardboard and paper clips. Use scissors to cut cardboard into strips that are at least 3 in (7.6 cm) wide. By bending these strips of cardboard, you can create simple chairs or chaise lounges. If you want the chair to stand up off the ground, bend paper clips to form chair ends and use glue or tape to attach them to the bottom of the chairs. Fold a 6 in (15 cm) long piece of cardboard in half to create a simple chair. Fold a 9 in (23 cm) long piece of cardboard into thirds to form a chaise lounge.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A parent or caregiver who is interested in fostering their child's creativity and imagination.

{"conversations": ["How to get a free room upgrade in las vegas?", "Las Vegas is home to high rollers, high stakes, and high hotel rates. In Vegas, the land of risk and reward, it is possible to lodge in style at a discounted rate. With a little finesse and a willing hotel clerk, you can upgrade your generic room to a swanky suite for free.\n\n## Book your room\n\n1. Visit Vegas at the right time. The dates of your visit to Vegas may increase your chances of receiving a free room upgrade. Travel experts, however, have conflicting opinions on the \u201cright time\u201d to visit Vegas. Visit during a period of low occupancy. According to some travel experts, if you want a free upgrade, reserve a room during a period of low-occupancy. For example, if the hotel is known to host businessmen and women during the week, book a stay on a weekend when there will be more suites available. Visit during a conference or event. Other travel experts insist that you are more likely to receive a free upgrade when all of the basic rooms are booked. This typically occurs during a conference or an event. Hotels may offer you a free upgrade to prevent you from switching hotels and to open up a less expensive room for a conference or event goer.\n2. Choose the right hotel. Some Vegas hotels and casinos are more likely to offer free upgrades than others. Before booking a hotel, conduct a quick search to determine which Vegas hotels and casinos are most likely to upgrade your room. You may wish to quickly survey friends, family, and contacts on social media. New hotels may be more likely to upgrade your room because they want a positive review.\n3. Book directly with the hotel. Hotel clerks are aware when you have reserved a room through a third party website. While booking through these sites may guarantee a better rate, it may also result in you being placed in a sub-par room with little chance of receiving a complimentary upgrade. Clerks are more willing to reward customers that book directly with the hotel. If you see a lower rate on a third party site, call the hotel and ask if they will match it.\n4. Book a more expensive room. In order to receive a free room upgrade, consider spending a little more money on the initial reservation. When a guest books a mid-range room over a basic room, the hotel makes more money. The customer staying in the more expensive room automatically becomes more valuable than a customer staying in a basic room. As a result, hotel clerks are more receptive to the needs and requests of a customer that has booked a more expensive room.\n5. Pay with the right credit card. When you book with certain credit cards, such as American Express, you may be automatically eligible to receive a free upgrade. This perk is typically only available to centurion or platinum cardholders. If you belong to a lower card holding class, however, it never hurts to ask if you qualify for a free room upgrade. If you are unsure of the perks offered by your credit card company, call a representative for clarification, conduct a quick internet search, or read through your welcome packet information.\n\n\n## Tip at check-in\n\n1. Check-in at a later time. Throughout the day, hotels gain a better understanding of their occupancy levels and available rooms for that evening and the days immediately following. You are more likely to benefit from this information, if you check-in at a later time. Arrive at the hotel in the late afternoon to evening.\n2. Prepare your tip. Prior to approaching the front desk, discretely prepare your tip. Fold your bill in half neatly. Insert the bill between your credit card and ID. The amount you tip is entirely your choice. Most people will slip clerks at least a twenty dollar bill.\n3. Observe the front desk attendants. Once you arrive (preferably late), take a moment to observe the hotel clerks. Identify a clerk that looks confident, competent, and not in charge. Once you have selected the clerk you want to assist you, approach him or her at the desk. If the clerk you have selected is not immediately available, allow a guest to go in front of you. Do not ask while other guests are around.\n4. Ask for what you want. When requesting a free upgrade, specificity and the word \u201ccomplimentary\u201d are key. If you do not ask for what you want, you may just end up with a room on a higher floor; if you leave out the word \u201ccomplimentary,\u201d the clerk may assume that you are willing to pay for the upgrade. After providing the clerk with your name, smile and slide your cards and tip across the desk. Tell the clerk that you are really interested in checking out a specific suite. Ask \u201cif there are any available complimentary upgrades?\u201d\n5. Thank the clerk. No matter the outcome, always treat the clerk politely. If the clerk upgrades your room, smile and thank them profusely. If the clerk does not upgrade your room, don\u2019t berate them. Instead, smile and thank them for their time and effort. If the clerk can upgrade your room, they will do so. If the clerk cannot upgrade your room, they should return your tip. You may choose to take back the bill or leave it with the clerk. Hotels are more inclined to help and reward guests that are nice, generous, and polite. From the moment you make your reservation, treat every member of the staff with respect. Any staff member, from the bellboy to the manager, could make your complimentary room upgrade possible.\n\n\n## Explore alternative methods\n\n1. Ask for a complimentary upgrade. When you simply ask for an upgrade, instead of discretely slipping the clerk a tip, you are taking a minimal risk that could result in major rewards. While checking in, nicely ask the clerk if there are any complimentary upgrades available. If there are, the clerk may be inclined to grant your request. If they can\u2019t offer you an official upgrade, they may transfer you to a room of a same rate that has a better view or is in a better location. If there are no free upgrades, ask how much it would cost to improve your room. The clerk may provide you with a discounted rate if they know you are willing to pay. Do not ask while other guests are around.\n2. Take advantage of a special occasion. When hotels learn that a guest has chosen to celebrate a special event at their establishment, they are honored. Special occasions provide them with a chance to show off. They will strive to make your stay special and memorable. When booking the room, mention that while you are there you will celebrate a special occasion, such as an anniversary, birthday, or honeymoon. While checking in, subtly mention that you are there for a special occasion. The clerk may then choose to upgrade your room or at the very least provide you with a surprise, such as champagne and chocolates.\n3. Be loyal to the hotel chain. Loyal hotel guests receive special treatment. Joining the hotel\u2019s loyalty program may help you distinguish yourself as a loyal guest. You will also rack up reward points that could lead to a free upgrade or even a free stay.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A travel enthusiast or frequent visitor to Las Vegas, who is always on the lookout for ways to save money and enhance their vacation experience.

{"conversations": ["How to say \"my name is\" in several languages?", "Here is how to say \"My name is...\" in several languages. The exact phrase is on top, with pronunciation guides in the bullets below.\n\n## European languages\n\n1. Say \"Moeto Nme e\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Bulgarian. This translates to \"my name is\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\"\n\t* \"MO-eg-toh e-meh eh \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\"\n2. Say \"Ik heet \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \" in Dutch. This is a somewhat gravelly sound. While \"heet\" is pronounced like \"hate,\" natural speakers almost slur the two together, almost like \"hee-EIGHT.\" \"Ick hate\"\n3. Say \"Je m'appelle \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in French. The words will somewhat glide together. This translates as \"I am called.\" \"Jhe- ma- pelle\"\n4. Say \"Me llamo \\_\\_\\_\\_ in Spanish. This one most people already know, but they still get tripped up by the double-L. In Spanish, the double-L sounds like an English \"y.\" \"Meh Yam-oh\"\n5. Say \"ich heisse \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in German. Really differentiate the three syllables, keeping them sharp and distinct. \"Ikh High- saa\"\n6. Say \"\u039c\u03b5 \u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5 \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" (Me lene) in Greek, or use an alternate expression. For more formal hellos, you can also say, \"\u039f\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\" (\"To o-no-ma mou e-ne,\") which translates to \"I am called.\" \"Meh Leh-neh\"\n\t* You can also change things up with \"\u039b\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9,\" (\"Leh-go-meh,\") meaning \"I'm named.\"\n7. Say \"A nevem\" in Hungarian. Like in French, the words need to somewhat slur together. The \"v\" sound in the middle should sound about halfway between a V and a W.\n\t* \"A neh-wem\"\n8. Say \"\u00c9g heiti \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \" in Icelandic. Icelandic is one of the world's hardest languages, but luckily fo you \"My Name is\" is quite easy. \"Yeg hey-tih\"\n9. Say \"mise \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Irish Gaelic. Not that this sounds completely different from how it looks. The \"se\" at the end sounds much more like \"sha.\" \"Mish-ah\"\n10. Say \"M\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0442\" Russian. No, that \"3\" shape is not a typo, it's just a part of the Russian Alphabet. If you don't have time to learn the whole thing, the pronunciation isn't tough. This translates into \"I am called.\" \"Men-ya za-voot\"\n11. Say either \"mi chiamo \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" or \"sono \\_\\_\\_\\_\" to say your name in Italian. These are the English equivalents of \"My name is \\_\\_\\_\\_\" or \"I'm \\_\\_\\_\\_.\" \"Mi Chiamo\" (Mee Key-ah-mo). \u2192 \"My name is....\"\n\t* \"Sono: (soh-no). \u2192 \"I'm...\"\n12. Say \"Nomen mihi est \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Latin. If you know how to speak Italian, Spanish, or French, the pronunciation is very similar. \"Me-he no-men es\"\n13. Say \"M\u0103 numesc \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" to give your name in Romanian. You can also use the phrase \"m\u0103 chiam\u0103\" as well. \"Ma new-Mesk\"\n\t* \"Ma key-ama\"\n14. Say \"Eg heiter \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Norwegian. Like in German, you're looking for three well-pronounced, distinct syllables. The second word sounds like \"height,\" as in how tall something is, in English. \"Egg Height-er\"\n\t* Note: this may also be spelled \"Jeg heter.\" This second versions is the more formal, traditional spelling. Both are correct.\n15. Say \"Vol\u00e1m sa \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" to give your name in Slovak. For more formal, longer phrase, you can use \"Moje meno je \\_\\_\\_\\_\" (\"My name is \\_\\_\\_\\_\"). The words in Slovak tend to be slightly jammed together, especially here, where they might sound like one word. \"Vol-am say\"\n16. Say \"Jag heter \\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Swedish. For more formal conversations, try out \"Mitt namn \u00e4r.\" This is tricky one, as the letters aren't used quite the same way in English. Try to make the \"i\" in \"mitt\" sound like an \"E\" sound. \"Yog Heat-err\"\n\t* \"Mit Nam Aer\"\n17. Say \"mia nomo estas\" (\"my name is\") or \"mi nomi\u011das\" (\"I'm called\") in Esperanto. Esperanto was invented in Poland after WWII as a politically neutral, global language. \"Mee-ah No-mo Ehs-tas\"\n\t* \"Mee no-me-jas\"\n\n\n## Asian languages\n\n1. Say, \"\u0986\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u09ae\" (Amar nam) in Bengali. If you can't read the characters, that is okay. The phonetic sounding is not difficult to pick up. \"Am-ar Nahm\"\n2. Say \"Mer\u0101 n\u0101m \\_\\_\\_\\_ hai\" in Hindi. Note how there is a word after your name -- \"hai.\" This translates literally to \"My name Nick is.\" This is grammatically correct in Hindi. \"May-rah nahm \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ hey\"\n\t* You use the same phrase in Urdu. It is written out as \"\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \\_\\_\\_\\_ \u06c1\u06d2.\"\n3. Say \"\u79c1\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306f...\u3067\u3059\u3002(Watashi no namae wa \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ desu)\" to speak in Japanese. Note that there is a word \"desu\" that comes after your name in Japanese. For simpler speaking, you can say, \"I am \\_\\_\\_\\_,\" or \"Watashi wa Nick\"' desu.\" \"Wat-a-shee no na-my wah \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ dehs\"\n\t* Wat-a-shee wah \\_\\_\\_\\_ dehs\"\n4. Use versions of \"Ako si \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" to say your name in Tagalog (Filipino). There are several versions of an introduction in Tagalog, all of which are easy to pick up. The word for name, \"pangalan\"\n\t* \n\t* Casual: Ako si \\_\\_\\_ \u2192 \" \"AkOH see\"\n\t* \n\t* Polite: Ako po si \\_\\_\\_ \u2192 \"AkOH poh see\"\n\t* \n\t* Formal: Ang pangalan ko ak\\_\\_\\_ \u2192 \"An pan-nall-en co ack\"\n5. Say \"\u6211\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u662f \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" (\"W\u01d2 de m\u00edngz\u00ec sh\u00ec\") to say your name in Chinese. This is in the Mandarin dialect. Chinese is not just about accent but also inflection, which completely changes the meanings of words. This is one you should absolutely listen to examples of. \"Wuo - duh - meeng -- tza -- shuu \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\"\n\t* For a simpler translation, try \"Wuo Jiao \\_\\_\\_\"\n\t* In Cantonese Chinese, use the phrase \"Ngo kui tso.\"\n6. Say \"\u1781\u17d2\u1789\u17bb\u17c6\u1788\u17d2\u1798\u17c4\u17c7 \\_\\_\\_\\_\" (\"khnhom chhmoh\") to speak in Khmer. Things might get difficult in Cambodia, Vietnam, or Laos, but this phrase can help start introductions. \"Ka-nohm ch'moo-ah\"\n7. Say \"T\u00ean t\u00f4i l\u00e0 \\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Vietnamese. Some speakers drop the first word, sticking instead with \" t\u00f4i l\u00e0 \\_\\_\\_.\" \"Ten Thoy la\"\n8. Say \"\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d \\_\\_\\_\" (\"p\u014fm ch\u00eau\") if you're a man, and \"\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d \\_\\_\\_\" (\"di-chen ch\u00eau\") if you're a female speaking Thai. Thai is a gendered language, so make sure you use the right form. The last word, though hyphenated below, should be smushed together. Male: \"pohm chee-ew\"\n\t* Female: \"dee-shaun chee-ew\"\n\n\n## African and middle eastern languages\n\n1. Say \"My naam is\" in Afrikaans. This language has some English roots, so it will be easier for you to pick up potentially. You'll also notice that is spelled with eerie familiarity...\n\t* \"May naahm ehs\"\n\t* Some people substitute \"Ek\" for \"my.\" This is more traditional, typically.\n2. Say \"\u0627\u0633\u0645\u064a \u0647\u0648 (Ismi houa)\" in Arabic. Some dialects of Arabic actually omit the second word, such as Sudanese Arabic. \"Is-mee Ho\n3. Say \"Ninaitwa \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ in Swahili. It's just one word, followed but your name. \"Nee-na-nweet-wa.\"\n4. Say \"\\_\\_\\_\\_ laa tudd\" to say your name in Wolof, a West African dialect. Note that Wolof is not a written language, so spelling is not very important. The language is common in Senegal, Gambia, and parts of North Africa. \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ la tood\"\n\t* You can also use \"Maa ngi tudd \\_\\_\\_\\_\" for \"my name is.\" Pronounced \"mahn-gee too-doo.\" Note the extra syllable on \"tudd.\"\n5. Say \"Igama lami ngu \\_\\_\\_\\_\" to say your name in Zulu. Again, this isn't a commonly written language, so don't worry much about spelling. It is pronounced much like it looks, with the \"ngu\" the hardest part. Sound it out like \"new,\" but try to get out a gutteral \"G\" sound right before the word. This is called a \"glottal stop,\" for word nerds out there. \"Ig-ah-mah la-mee (g)new\"\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A language enthusiast or romantic partner who is interested in expressing their feelings in different languages.

{"conversations": ["How to keep dogs safe on the fourth of july?", "## Beforehand\n\n1. Ensure that your pet\u2019s information is up to date. Many dogs escape when they are startled by fireworks. If your pet doesn\u2019t have a collar with a tag that has contact information on it, as well as a microchip with your current information, now is the time to get them. Your collar should fit securely but comfortably; it should be snug enough that it won\u2019t be easily caught on a branch or other such thing, but not so tight as to make it uncomfortable for your dog to wear it. Be certain that it doesn't restrict your dog\u2019s airflow \u2013 you should be able to fit two fingers between your dog\u2019s collar and neck. There should be a tag that ensures the dog does not have rabies and another with your name and phone number on it. A microchip is a tiny transponder that uses radiofrequency waves to transmit information on the chip about your pet when scanned. It is implemented painlessly just under the skin using a large-bore needle by veterinarians and some shelters. Once your dog has a microchip, you must register with the company the microchip is made by; now, if your dog arrives at a shelter, (s)he will be scanned and the microchip will give the shelter your phone number to contact you with. Your microchip must have recent contact information; if it does not, simply contact the microchip company to update your information.\n2. Brush up on your dog\u2019s training. Your dog should have basic obedience training, and should easily respond to you. The most vital commands to train are walking on a leash, \u201ccome,\u201d and \u201cleave it,\u201d in addition to crate training. If your puppy is young and hasn\u2019t been leash trained, and you intend to bring the dog to parades/parties/fireworks displays, now is the time to do this. For information on leash training, read this wikiHow article. Your recall command should be rock-solid. If your dog runs off in reaction to fireworks, or after an interesting smell, you must be able to recall him. A related command is \u201cstay\u201d; for information on teaching this, read this article. During parties or parades, your dog is likely to come across yummy food that\u2019s unhealthy for him to eat. To prevent him from eating anything he shouldn't, your \u201cleave it\u201d command should be very good. Another useful, related command is \u201cdrop it\u201d; for information on teaching this, read this article. A crate is a useful tool during 4th of July celebrations, serving both to safely contain the dog and often calm him/her. For information on crate training, read this article.\n3. Plan your party carefully. Choose decorations carefully \u2013 glow sticks, which are both toxic for dogs and enticingly similar to colorful chew toys, are particularly dangerous. As beer and other human food and drink are toxic for dogs, decide on a place to keep your dog(s) during the party, such as in the house if the party is in the yard. If the dog is friendly and would like to stay with the people, consider keeping him with you leashed; contained by keeping him in a room with a baby gate barring passage if the party is inside; or securely tying him to a tree, fence, or other secure object if the party is outside. Before the party, research what foods are toxic to dogs. For information on avoiding foods toxic to dogs, read this article.\n4. Contact a veterinarian. For owners of dogs that are extremely reactive to fireworks or other typical Independence Day activities, the best option may be to discuss ways to help your dog with an experienced veterinarian. Topics to discuss include reducing stress for older dogs and the option of sedating the dog using safe drugs.\n5. Consider moving your dog. If your dog is extremely stressed by Independence Day activities, the best option may be to move him to another place for the duration of the celebrations or during the most active part (such as a parade). It may be possible to locate a \u201cdoggy hotel,\u201d friend or relative in a quiet rural area willing to keep the dog; however, expect there to be at least some amount of fireworks or parties, and it can be difficult to locate a business or person willing to care for your dog during the celebrations.\n6. Investigate products that may serve to calm your dog. A commercial product of \u201canxiety wrap,\u201d has been used with great success. Created by behavioral experts, such an item can calm dogs in a manner similar to swaddling an infant. A crate can be very useful, as stated above. As wolves naturally occupied dens, a dog will find comfort in his own \u201cden,\u201d or a crate. To increase the darkness, cover the crate with a blanket, leaving part of it uncovered so the dog can see passing people and breathe fresh air. It is possible to purchase relaxing auditory CDs that have been clinically researched to calm anxious dogs; these can be helpful for calming dogs frightened by Independence Day celebrations. Ask your veterinarian for more advice.\n\n\n## Party\n\n1. Secure your dog in the pre-decided place, if applicable. If he is going into a crate, place the crate in a quiet area of the house and put a safe bone, favorite toy, or other treats inside to occupy the dog. The dog will go in for the treat; once he or she is in, drape a dark-colored blanket over the crate to create darkness. Praise him and close windows and doors; you can also play a TV, radio, iPod, etc. to cover the sound of the party, or use the soothing music. If the dog is staying in the house, choose a room where the dog will be able to see the people but which people will not enter (for example, an office or study). Leave something to keep him occupied, and consider playing music/etc.\n2. If the dog will be staying with you, keep him away from food. Avoid tables, where scraps can lay or food can sit tantalizingly close. If a guest offers your dog food, politely inform your guest that human food can be toxic for dogs and that you would prefer for your dog not to eat any. Guests, especially children, might ask you if they can walk or pet the dog; if they do, tell them that feeding the dog food is not allowed. Do not leave the dog unattended \u2013 this is particularly dangerous outside, where stray fireworks can land or the dog can bolt from if fireworks go off or there is another loud noise.\n3. Stay calm and alert. You\u2019ll want to be on the lookout for anything that could scare your dog, but keep in mind that your dog can sense your emotions and will often copy them. For example: If you\u2019re on edge and nervous, your dog will sense this and be on edge and nervous as well. Clearly, you can\u2019t control your guests\u2019 behavior, but take the following precautions:\n\t* Stay aware of the effect of the party\u2019s tone on your dog. If your dog starts to become anxious or overly active, the best option can be to put him in a separate room, crate, etc. Ask kids to play away from your dog. Children running around can be especially upsetting for a dog, and it\u2019s a good idea to ask any kids upsetting your dog to quiet down or play in a separate area.\n4. Watch out for stray fireworks. These are an unfortunate danger in places where fireworks have been set off or have been set off nearby, and it\u2019s wise to stay on guard for any, as fireworks are unpredictable and can be highly dangerous.\n\n\n## Parade\n\n1. Consider leaving your dog at home. Parades can be stressful, and often the best option is to leave him at home in a crate or room, as described in the section on parties. If you don\u2019t want to leave your dog alone, another option is to leave him with friends or family not attending. However, if you do decide to bring your dog with you, follow the steps below to keep your dog as calm and safe as possible.\n2. Purchase or gather the supplies you may need. These include:\n\t* A crate for securing your dog. A secure leash and collar. A harness or controlling item such as a head collar might be preferred, as your dog may pull. A muzzle. This is a necessary safety precaution, as the sights and sounds of a parade can distress your dog to the point of biting. A collapsible water bowl and water. Your pet must be kept hydrated, as should you.\n3. Introduce your dog to the parade gradually. Though you likely won\u2019t be able to follow through a complete desensitization due to lack of time, you can introduce your dog gradually \u2013 at first, simply allow him to adjust to the sight, smell, and noise of the crowd at a closer and closer distance, and the parade using the same rules.\n4. Keep your dog under control. You should only bring a dog to a parade if he has been obedience trained, but even if he has been, keep a closer eye on your dog than usual. Watch for signs that your dog is uneasy or upset; if the parade upsets your dog too much, you can take him away from the parade or, if possible, set up a crate in a secure location.\n5. Keep your dog as safe as possible. Keeping your dog in a car is never a safe option, as the heat can give your dog heatstroke \u2013 or even kill him \u2013 and water must be provided regularly to prevent heat stroke and keep your dog hydrated. Read this article for information on treating heat stroke.\n\n\n## Firework show\n\n1. Consider leaving your dog at home. As with parades, fireworks can be upsetting and even dangerous for dogs. Dogs who are startled by them can run off and escape, and, even if they have an up-to-date tag and microchip, are not guaranteed to be found or returned. Optionally, you can consult a veterinarian for information on drugging your dog, but in general, bringing your dog is discouraged, and should only be done if your dog:\n\t* Has heard fireworks before and did not strongly react to them;\n\t* Has an up-to-date tag and microchip;\n\t* Has basic obedience training; \u201ccome\u201d in particular must be rock-solid; and\n\t* Is calm around crowds, playing kids, other dogs, and various other features of fireworks.\n2. Gather your supplies. These are the same as in the section on parades.\n3. Train your dog. If your dog appears anxious, do not reassure him \u2013 this will reward him for bad behavior, as in essence he is receiving a yummy treat when he is afraid, telling him that he should be afraid. Instead, give him attention and a treat whenever he is calm; you are now telling him that being calm is good. Use small treats easily swallowed with a strong scent to distract the dog.\n4. Keep an eye on your dog. Signs of anxiety include the dog licking his lips, whimpering, a tense position, and showing the whites of his eyes; if these occur, quietly and calmly remove the dog from the situation. Keep your dog hydrated; bring along a collapsible water bowl and bottles of water and offer water to your dog occasionally. Keep in mind that he may be too stressed to drink \u2013 if this happens, the best option may be to remove your dog from the situation. If your dog is calm, you can distract him with treats, a Kong toy stuffed with peanut butter, a favorite toy, or any other desirable object.\n5. Be prepared to leave. If your dog is too stressed by the fireworks, the best option is to immediately leave for your home. If you\u2019re attending the fireworks with others, tell them in advance that you may have to leave if your dog becomes too anxious. At home, have a crate set up in the same manner described in the section on parties. Keep in mind that a car is not a safe option for putting your dog in, as the heat levels can kill him/her; instead, the safest option is to leave with your dog and place him in the crate. Once he\u2019s settled in, you can return to the fireworks and have fun.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned pet owner who is looking for practical advice to ensure their dog's safety during the noisy and chaotic Fourth of July celebrations.

{"conversations": ["How to get around st. louis on the cheap?", "Whether you're traveling around St. Louis on vacation, visiting the area on business or live in the metro area, there are several ways to get around St. Louis on the cheap. The city's bus, train or van metro system are among the cheapest ways to get around. Another good note is that if you're visiting the dowtown STL area during the week, there are often \"City Guide\" personnel roaming (either on bike or foot), that will assist with any directions.\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1.

{"conversations": ["How to peacefully feed cats in multi\u2010cat households?", "## Feed multiple cat at once\n\n1. Feed discrete meals. Feeding all of your cats at one time, instead of letting them graze, will minimize conflict and fighting. Instead of allowing access to food at all times, which can lead to conflict when two cats want to eat from the same bowl at the same time, timed meals will allow all cats to have their own space and food to focus on. How often you feed your cats each day depends on your schedule. In many cases, it works best to feed your cats once in the morning before you leave and once again in the evening when you return. Provide food puzzles if you have a cat(s) that is used to grazing instead of eating at meal times. This will help them transition to timed meals. Putting a small amount of kibble in one of these puzzles won't replace a whole meal but it may satiate a cat enough until meal time comes around.\n2. Monitor feeding time. Do not feed your cats and then leave your home. It is important that you monitor feeding time, so that you can make the cats stay at their own feeding stations and break up any conflicts that might occur. It may be that your presence calms your cats while they eat because they know that they will be protected from other cats trying to get their food when you are around. This will allow them to focus on their food more than on defensiveness. If you see a cat trying to eat another cat's food, physically separate them. It's important that you do this so the more submissive cat doesn't get taken advantage of.\n3. Remove food dishes after 20-30 minutes. When feeding multiple cats you should remove food dishes after the cats have eaten or after 20-30 minutes, if one or more of your cats are very slow about eating. This will teach the cats that there is a set time to eat and if they don't eat at that given time, then there is no food to be had. The goal is to make meal time a time for strictly for eating, not a time to play games, show dominance, or fight for territory. Setting specific meal times and taking away food when meal time is over requires a gradual training process that may take some time for your cats to adjust to. If your cat meows repeatedly at you for food when it is not meal time, just remember that you are working to make a peaceful household and your cat will not starve if it has to wait an hour for food.\n4. Use calming sprays. If your cats are very territorial and tend to fight over food, you may want to try using a calming product made for cats during feeding times. These products tend to be non-toxic sprays that use pheromones to calm cats and reduce fear and aggression. Spray one of these products, which are usually available at most pet stores, around the feeding area or on the specific cats that are most fearful or aggressive. The pheromone sprays used for calming cats mimic the pheromones given off by mother cats to calm their kittens.\n\n\n## Set up separate feed station\n\n1. Give each cat its own dish. When feeding multiple cats, competition can be fierce if every cat doesn't have its own dish to eat from. Separate dishes allow each cat to have their own space and their own food to focus on, instead of focusing on defending against another cat. Make sure that the food bowls are as identical as possible. You do not want to create competition for a food dish that is easier to eat out of or is slightly bigger. Don't forget to place a water bowl near each food bowl. In most cases, when you first set out multiple food dishes the cats will naturally gravitate to one of their own. Once they have basically picked their bowls, make them stick to them to establish their territories.\n2. Don't place food dishes against walls. In many cases, a cat in a multi-cat household will want to be in a position while eating where it can see any other cats coming towards it. If you place food dishes against a wall, the cat will naturally be forced to have its back to the wall. This may add to its anxiety and not allow it to relax during eating. Placing your cat's bowl even a foot away from the wall should allow it to sit in any place around the bowl that it feels is best.\n3. Place the cats as far away from each other as possible. When feeding cats in a multiple cat household, you need to space them away from each other. This may mean that you place food dishes in separate corners of the same room or you place feeding stations in completely separate rooms. Giving all your cats space from other cats will allow them to better focus on their food instead of turf wars or food competition. It is ideal if your cats cannot see each other during meal time. This add tremendously to your cat's ability to focus on food instead of the other cats.\n4. Isolate cats eating different foods. If your cats eat different food, it is important that you feed them in different spaces. This will help you to keep each cat eating the food that it is supposed to eat and it will prevent fights over whatever food your cats consider the tastiest. It may be that one of your cats eats different food and your other cats eat the same food. If this is the case, only the cat with different food needs to be isolated during meal time. Cats that are eating different food need to be kept separate until all cats in the household are done eating. The will remove the temptation to sneak a bite from the bowl of the last cat eating.\n5. Try adding an extra feeding dish if problems persist. Adding 1 more dish than the number of cats you have can help eliminate any chances of conflict. With an extra bowl, your cats won't have a problem finding somewhere to eat in peace. For example, if you have 2 cats, you could try adding a third feeding dish. If you add an additional feeding dish, make sure you put a water dish nearby.\n\n\n## Avoid conflict\n\n1. Coax cats to their own bowls. If more than one cat goes to one bowl at mealtime, you should coax the cat away who does not normally eat at that bowl. This could be done by picking the cat up, calling to it, or luring it towards its own bowl with a bit of food. This separation will prevent territorial disputes and conflict during meal time. There can be power dynamics between cats that they need to sort out themselves. When cats are initially establishing whose dish is whose, there may be some switching up that occurs.\n2. Stop fights right away. When fights break out over territory or food you should break them up right away. Fighting over food, especially between cats who usually get along, can lead to unhealthy aggression, so it should be stopped before it gets serious. If you have two cats that repeatedly fight over food dishes, these cats should be fed in different rooms.\n3. Avoid conflict before it starts. In order to have a peaceful household with multiple cats, you may need to resort to keeping certain cats away from each other most of the time, which includes meal time. This will allow you to avoid conflict before it begins and it allows both cats to have peaceful and calm time in their homes. If you have a very small home, this can be difficult to achieve. Keeping cats that don't get along separated works better if you have a large house or at least several rooms that can be closed off. You can also try feeding aggressive cats in cat carriers. That way they won't be able to run around and harass your other cats when they're finished eating. While it is true that some cats may have conflict at first and then learn to get along, that is not always the case. If you have tried to get your cats to get along and nothing seems to work, it may be time to give them separate territories in your home.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A cat owner or pet care professional who is seeking advice on managing multiple cats in a household, ensuring their peaceful coexistence during feeding times, and maintaining a stress-free environment.

A rabbit can fill up on it (because of the bulk), but still need food because they didn't get enough calories, vitamins, minerals, etc.\nIf you look at the USDA's webpage on iceberg lettuce. You'll notice that water makes up just about 95% of the nutrients, leaving 5% to be divided up between every other nutrient. Protein is a little less than 1%, Carbohydrates less than 3%, and sugars less than 2%.\nMost importantly, you want to pay attention to the vitamin and calorie content. Iceberg lettuce has only 14 calories per 100 grams (2 calories or less in each leaf), and 18mg of calcium.\nOther effects to consider, is when fed straight from the fridge, lettuce will be cold and wet, both are conditions that can upset a pet's stomach.\nIn addition, since most rabbit breeders do not feed lettuce to their baby rabbits, it is an unfamiliar food and if the rabbit owner does not add lettuce to the diet gradually, it will cause stomach upset.\nFinally, it is often believed amoung rabbit breeders that\n\nRabbits should not eat some lettuces (such as iceberg) as they contain a substance called laudanum which can be harmful in large quantities.\n\nRSPCA: Rabbit Diet Myths\nBut this is disputed because\n\nLettuce does not contain laudanum.

{"conversations": ["How to be in a relationship without your parents knowing?", "Do you have a relationship you want to hide from your parents? Are your parents unreasonable, abusive, or just a bit too conservative? Whether you\u2019re keeping it a secret because you\u2019re too young or because your parents won\u2019t approve due to their values, hiding your relationship can be challenging. While you could risk losing your parents' trust if they ever find out, you don't want to put yourself in harm's way or compromise your values. Communication, honesty, and trust are essential to any relationship, but sometimes you need to be less than truthful for your own mental and physical health.\n\n## Examine why you should hide your relationship\n\n1. Evaluate your priorities. Decide if it's actually a good idea to keep your relationship with your parents. Do your parents disapprove of your relationship because they are strict, protective or worrisome? Does culture, religion, or an age difference factor into their disapproval? While your parents have the benefit of life experience, only you know what your relationship is worth to you. Talk to your friends and support system. Remember that if you keep your relationship a secret, the greater the potential problems will be when it comes to light. You have a support system to help guide you in the right direction. If you just don't think the relationship is serious enough yet and don't wish your parents to make a big deal of it, some of the following instructions may be excessive. Consider how your parents may feel if you exaggerated the need for secrecy; they may feel disappointed and wonder why don't you trust them. Take risks prevention if you really go ahead. For example, think about what would you do if you are caught by your parents, think about what would you do if your parents know you are owning a separate social media account/secret cell phone that makes use to communicate with your partner, think about what would you do if your dating relationship goes wrong, think about what would you do if you broke up, etc. Consider whether these risks/consequences are affordable. It is recommended to be honest if you are getting caught. Once you get caught, more lies would only make you get into greater trouble, damaging a family relationship. As for dating relationship goes wrong or challenges comes, you will need great mental and physical quality to afford it without any support from your parents.\n2. Communicate with your partner. If you want to pursue your relationship despite knowing that your parents will disapprove, let your partner know why you think that this is the right course of action. Your partner may feel less important and bring resentment to your relationship if you don't clarify your stance. The longer you hide, the more difficult it is going to be. Your partner may have a valid argument if he or she has been through this situation before. For example, just because it is your first interracial relationship, it may not be the first time for your partner. He or she may have practical advice to help you understand where your parents are coming from and, above all else, having her support can help ease your stress. Your partner may also misunderstand the situation. Some people expect to be introduced at the start of a serious relationship, some are cool with waiting, and some do not wish to be introduced for quite some time.\n3. Consider the opinions of your parents. It may be difficult to hear negative opinions about someone you care about, but sometimes your parents may have a better perspective on long-term outcomes. Depending on your dynamic with your parents, they may have trouble articulating their disapproval. Relationships with parents can be complicated. It may be difficult to be open and honest but keep your communication respectful so as not to escalate the situation. For example, while you may think that you are hiding your emotions, you actually may be coming off passive-aggressive or snarky.\n4. Remember all healthy relationships are built on trust, respect, and communication. Whether you are trying to strengthen your relationship with your partner or maintain the relationship with your parents, trust and respect have to be present for a lasting relationship. If you plan on hiding your relationship, ask yourself why sacrificing your parent's trust is the only option. Physical and emotional well-being should not be sacrificed for anyone, including your parents or partner. Will your parents become physically or verbally abusive if they found out about your relationship? Is any aspect of your relationship conflict with your parents\u2019 beliefs? If your parents\u2019 disapproval is based on prejudice or if their reaction is abusive, seek professional help. Your mental and physical health is your first priority.\n\n\n## Overcome overbear parent\n\n1. Be mature. Your parents will always be protective so show them that you are old enough to handle the responsibilities of a relationship. Firstly, show your parents that you are responsible and can follow all the rules. If your parents think you are too young for a relationship, be on time, do your chores, and study. If you can gain your parents' trust, then your parents will soon realize that you are mature enough to handle a relationship.\n2. Understand the risks of premarital sex. Parents often forbid relationships for fear of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infection. Ensure that you and your partner truly understand these risks. There is a real possibility that if you are not prepared, and you do have an unwanted pregnancy or contract an STD, your parents may not be there to support you or just can't help you (e.g., they can help you with bringing up a child to some extent, if they wish to do so; they can't cure HIV).You may not agree with your parents rules, but communicate with your partner and respect each other's boundaries to ensure you are both prepared and safe. Know that you should be respected by your significant other and that they should listen to your choices. Compromise is vital in a relationship, but this is one area where neither party should have to compromise their beliefs. Know that if you are eager to take the relationship to another level but your partner isn't ready, you must respect their choice. Never pressure your partner.\n3. Avoid PDA moments. Be discreet about your affection. You never know who is watching. A trusted friend may accidentally tell your parents in passing, not knowing that your relationship is a secret. Stealing kisses in public and other forms of PDA may seem harmless but remember that if your parents find out, they may think that your relationship has already crossed further into the intimacy threshold.\n4. Buy one new cell phone secretly. If it is possible to do so, owning a separate cell phone can help you in concealing information, but please remember that you must hide your new phone properly or you will be in trouble. If you are not able to buy one new phone, you may put a password in your original cell phone and computer if FEASIBLE. However, it is not advised to do so. Putting or changing a password on shared computer/ cell phone may get suspicious, even some parents may ask you to unlock/undo the password set when they check your phone or use the family computer. Delete the messages on your phone when you sleep or leave your phone unattended. It is recommended to delete partly instead of all messages because you may get suspicious if the messaging history is blank. It is best to use Incognito mode on a browser when you are online. Otherwise, erase browsing history after you have been online. However, erasing browsing history may look suspicious if the browser history has never been erased on a shared device, but if you use Incognito mode, you don't need to worry about this. In case your parents check your phone, either don\u2019t put your partner\u2019s number on your phone or use your partner\u2019s nickname or surname instead of his actual first name. It is also possible to use the masculine or feminine form of their name. For example, Brian becomes Brianna and Stephanie becomes Stephen. However, it is best to memorize your partner's contact information in your mind and don't put any of his/her contact information on your phone.\n5. Tell your partner not to post anything on social media sites or send instant messages. If you have a social media account or use other instant messaging apps, your parents could check up on you or hear from someone else with access to your account. Create an alternate account that you can use to be romantic with your partner. This is a handy tool when dealing with long distance relationships.\n6. Have a cover. The trustworthy friends take two jobs: 1)Helping you on hiding the relationship and giving you advice on your relationship. They can support you on hiding the relationship such as collaborate on stories for your parents if you're on a date. Not only those friends can be a great cover-up for phone calls or texts, but they also act as an Intelligence Agency so that you can beat yourself to the punch to take prevention. For instance, you friends find out your parents would go to somewhere on someday, then you should take consideration before you want to meet with your partner. The another job of them is monitoring your relationship. You should acquire a political wisdom: The more voice, you make smarter decision. It is better to have more than one reliable friends so that you can listen to more than one voice if you have lots of resources to do this, even your friends could form a 'House'. However the biggest disadvantage is the larger social group, the greater chance of secret leakage even through they are royal. If your friends has concerns about your partner or refuses to continue being your alibi, heed his/her advice. It\u2019s easy to think that one source is wrong, but if multiple sources are telling you not to continue your relationship, perhaps it\u2019s best to listen to their logic. Using them as an excuse if they don't agree to it is unfair to your friend.\n7. Hide gifts. It is best to hide all the gifts safely. It could be at the outside of your home at your trustworthy friend's home, rent storage, your partner's home, etc. It is strongly advised not to keep the gifts at your home because your parents could find these gifts easily if they are intended and diligent in scanning every corner of your house thoroughly. You're going to draw attention from your parents if you suddenly lock your closet or room. You can also agree to treat each other to lunches or movies rather than giving physical gifts.\n\n\n## Manage collateral\n\n1. Prevent your friends from commenting about your relationship with anyone. Whether it's telling people in passing or posting on each other's social media pages, convey how catastrophic it would be if their innocent comment made its way to your parents. Social media can be especially dangerous because you never know who is connected to whom. Ask your friends politely not to post any incriminating comments or pictures. It may be a wise idea not to let anyone take any pictures when you are in a group setting with your significant other.\n2. Use multiple social media accounts. The great thing about social media is that the larger sites are free. Set up as many accounts as you need to cover your tracks. Remember your password and only log on when using a device not shared with your parents.\n3. Set up a shell email account. Not only would a fake email account be advantageous because your parents won't recognize it, but you should also use it to set up your fake social media account. Remember that your parents can search for you on social media based on your email info.\n4. Adjust your privacy settings on social media. All social media will give you an option to filter what information you share with the public. Go to the Settings Menu and set up your profile so that only you and your partner have access to it. You can also select a few friends to be able to view your profile if you deem them trustworthy. You will have the opportunity to filter your updates and postings so that you can block your parents from seeing. However, the best way to block your parents from seeing is not to post anything damaging at all.\n5. Provide false information when creating shared social media accounts or when together in a public gathering. Remember that your parents can search social media sites via your date of birth, phone number, last name, school, or job. Don't make the mistake of creating a false account without ensuring every detail won't lead back to you. Change your profile name completely. Don't use your middle name, your name spelled backward, or the name of your dog. Anything remotely close to you may end up giving you away in the long run. It's better to exercise extreme caution.\n6. Hide your emotions. If you get into an argument with your partner, try not to show your parents how angry or sad you are. Don't emote in public for it to get back to your parents. Find an outlet to release your emotions. It may be difficult to be unable to share your emotions, so research ways to prevent emotional outbursts. For example, taking up boxing may work to vent frustration while listening to upbeat music in headphones may be enough to cheer you up after an argument with your partner. Only you know how to handle your emotions.\n7. Keep track of what you are telling everyone. If you are lying to a lot of people, it will become difficult to keep track of all the details. Keep your stories consistent and try to keep it as simple as possible. The more details you add, the more difficult it will be to remember them all.\n8. Frame your partner as a platonic relationship. Don't let your parents get suspicious you are hiding a relationship from them by letting them know that you have a platonic relationship with your partner that demands your time. Introduce them openly and talk about them the same as any other platonic relationship in your life. For example, if you introduce them as your coworker, you can talk about work-related issues and meetings and how you and your partner have supported one another through deadlines.\n9. Change your routine. Meet your partner at places that you would not normally go to and that your parents are not aware of. Change your social calendar so that you leave no chance of getting caught by your parents or someone who could tell your parents. Better yet, find out your parents' schedule. Not only will you be able to have peace-of-mind knowing where your parents are but you will also be able to meet your partner as far away from them as you can.\n\n\n## Deal with a difference in age\n\n1. Ask yourself if you feel like yourself around your partner. Your partner should accept you for who you are and your parents may not be able to see beyond the age difference. Once your parents see that your relationship is healthy and that you are a better person for it, it will be easier for them to see beyond the age gap.\n2. Keep perspective. It\u2019s easy to get swept up in the allure of dating someone older or younger than you. Look ahead and see if the age difference will affect you in any way. Your parents may be fearful that the age gap may widen as your relationship continues. A difference in age may be more of a big deal if you are younger. Your parents may be fearful that you are growing up too soon or that an older partner is taking advantage of you. A big age gap if you're a minor and your partner isn't may also be illegal. Take their perspective into account when continuing your relationship.\n3. Understand any power dynamics. If your partner is your professor or boss, it\u2019s prudent to know the rules. Your parents may rest easier knowing that everyone is protected from any legal actions. Understand that being in a teacher-pupil relationship can get the teacher fired and, depending on your age, even jailed. This is one relationship that is better to be put on hold - for both of you. If you truly love each other, you can wait until both of you are adults, and you have graduated.\n\n\n## Deal with your parents\u2019 different value\n\n1. Surround yourself with supportive people. If you must hide your relationship because of a difference in values -- whether religious or cultural -- seek the help of people who have been in similar situations. Bide time to help your parents and/or partner adjust to the situation. By surrounding yourself with caring and respectful people, you can rise above your parents\u2019 closed-mindedness if they are unwilling to change.\n2. Support your partner. Assure your partner that they are cared for and that you don\u2019t agree with your parents but don\u2019t want to lose your relationship with them. Build his confidence that your parents' opinions won\u2019t hurt your relationship. Let him know that he is more important than your parent\u2019s approval and that the secrecy is temporary. You don\u2019t need to put a time limit, but it can be expected that your partner may give you an ultimatum. No one wants to be in a relationship that their partner is ashamed to be in. Be prepared to choose between telling your parents or losing your partner.\n3. Don\u2019t take a side. This isn\u2019t about who is right or wrong, this is about how you define family and your own values. Everyone will have to learn to respect and accept one another if you want to have them in your life.

{"conversations": ["How to know what to charge for babysitting?", "Babysitting is a great way to earn money and get experience taking care of children, but figuring out how much to charge for your time can be tricky. Many babysitters don\u2019t have much work experience, and they feel bad asking for money. Remember, your time is valuable and you deserve to be paid fairly! Figure out a good base rate by talking with babysitters and parents in your area. You can also use an online babysitting rate calculator. Then charge more based on how many children you\u2019re sitting, their needs, your skills, and your transportation costs.\n\n## Set a base rate\n\n1. Ask other babysitters you know what they charge. If you know anybody else who babysits, ask them what they charge. Once you have multiple opinions, you can see what the average is. Since they live in your area, they\u2019ll know what a reasonable rate is for where you live. Different areas have very different rates, depending on what people\u2019s average income is. Ask a fellow babysitter, \u201cI\u2019m a new babysitter and am trying to figure out what to charge. I was wondering how much you charge per hour?\u201d\n\t* Major cities and their suburbs generally pay higher rates than small towns. In New York City and L.A., sitters charge about $20 an hour, while in Houston and Chicago they charge $15.\n2. Use an online rate calculator. The internet has a lot of babysitting rate calculators that allow you to put in your zip code and how many years of babysitting experience you have. It will calculate the average rate. One example is https://www.care.com/babysitting-rates.\n3. Ask parents you know what they pay for babysitters. Ask trusted adults in your area how much they pay their babysitters. This will help you get an idea of how much people are willing to pay. Once you have an idea, propose it to your client, and see if they think it\u2019s fair. Keep in mind that parents will pay more per hour for a qualified nanny than for a teenage babysitter. Parents will also pay differently for full-time babysitting than for occasional nights or weekends.\n4. Look up what the minimum wage is in your area. Too many babysitters settle for less than minimum wage because they\u2019re not sure what it is, or because the job is less official than jobs that require work permits. Counties and cities calculate the minimum wage based on what they think is a fair amount to give someone for an hour of their time, so you should charge at least that. If you\u2019re underage to work at a regular job or are undocumented, you should still ask for the minimum wage. You deserve to be paid fairly.\n\n\n## Increase your base rate\n\n1. Increase your rate when you gain experience and qualifications. The more babysitting experience you have, the more skilled and qualified you are. Also, the older you are, the more you can charge. Increase your rate when you pass big milestones like graduating middle school or high school. Charge more if you have extra skills, like CPR certification or camp counselor experience.\n2. Charge more if there are more children. Once you\u2019ve settled on a reasonable base rate, charge more money (maybe 5 dollars more per hour) for each additional child you\u2019re asked to look after. Watching 1 or 2 children is very different from watching 5 children, so make sure you\u2019re comfortable with it before saying yes to the job. Also, consider asking your client if you can bring a co-babysitter along with you for large groups of children. The client should pay both babysitters a reasonable rate for this to be a fair deal.\n3. Charge more for special needs and skills. If the child you\u2019re being asked to watch is an infant who requires constant supervision, diaper changing, and bottles, you can charge more than if you\u2019re watching a 10 year old. If the child has special needs or is particularly rambunctious or difficult to manage, you should also charge more, because you will have specialized skills to take care of them. Offer the price you think is fair considering the amount of physical and emotional energy that goes into caring for that child.\n4. Increase your rate if they ask you to do extra chores. You should feel free to charge more if your client asks you to do household chores like sweeping, mopping, dishes, laundry, grocery shopping, and cooking. You can also charge more if they ask you to care for their pets or help their children with their homework. The more tasks they ask you to do outside of just watching their child, the more you can charge for your hourly rate.\n5. Factor in transportation. If you have to travel a long time to get to your babysitting job, you should charge for your commute. Talk to your client about ways to do this. You can include your commute-time in the amount of time you\u2019re compensated for. Another way is to have your client pay for your gas money or your bus tickets, depending on how you are getting there. If you have to bike or walk to your babysitting job in the dark, make sure you feel safe. Otherwise, you should refuse the job, or ask for different hours. Don\u2019t accept a ride from an unfamiliar babysitting client. It may not be safe.\n6. Ask for more payment for babysitting on holidays. If your client asks you to work on Christmas, Valentine\u2019s Day, New Year\u2019s Eve, or some other special occasion, you should charge more. First of all, you\u2019re giving up having a fun time, and you should only do that for the big bucks. And secondly, the client will be willing to pay more, because it\u2019s hard to find sitters on nights like that. On the other hand, if you\u2019re babysitting in the middle of a Sunday afternoon, you\u2019ll probably get less money than babysitting on a Saturday night, when your clients want to go on a date night.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned parent or babysitter looking to establish fair and competitive rates for their babysitting services.

{"conversations": ["How to extract oil from a coconut?", "Coconut oil is great for cooking and many other uses. Making it at home can be time consuming and tricky, but you can do it with a bit of dedication! Start by removing the meat of the coconut from its shell. Then, use a blender to combine the meat with water and make coconut milk. From that, you can refine the oil using heat or a cold-press method.\n\n## Remove the meat from the shell\n\n1. Pierce the softest eye with a metal skewer. Poke at each of the coconut's 3 eyes. You should find one that's softer. When you do, push the skewer through the eye, making a hole through it. The eyes are the small dark circles that are clustered together on the top of the coconut. You can also use a wooden skewer, but it could break. You could also try an ice pick or even just a sharp knife.\n2. Pour the coconut water into a container. Turn the hole over a container and shake out the water. It may take a moment or two to get it all out; you should end up with 0.25 to 0.75 cups (59 to 177 mL) of coconut water from each coconut. If you need to, make the hole bigger. Coconut water is good for drinking, and you won't really need it for the oil.\n3. Whack the coconut with a hammer or meat tenderizer until it breaks. Grab the coconut with a towel and turn it so the shell is exposed. Tap the coconut with the tool, turning it as you do. The shell will eventually crack. Keep tapping to expand the crack around the coconut. You can also use anything else heavy you have laying around, such as a small cast iron skillet or even a pestle. If you're using a skillet, set the coconut on a cutting board or another hard surface to crack it. You can also hit it on a hard surface.\n4. Break the shell off the coconut by cracking it in pieces. Once the shell has cracked in the middle all the way around, the coconut should break in half. Place one half face-down on a cutting board, then whack the shell with the hammer or meat tenderizer. Just hitting it a few times should make the flesh loose enough to pull out. Another option is to keep hitting it on a hard surface until the shell cracks off. Keep turning the shell to hit a new spot each time.\n5. Remove the flesh and rinse the coconut. Use a butter knife to lever out the coconut flesh. Wash the coconut pieces under running water to remove any debris from the flesh. Some people prefer to peel off the thin, brown skin, though it's not necessary. If you'd like to, use a vegetable peeler to take it off and rinse the pieces again.\n\n\n## Use a blender to make coconut milk\n\n1. Chop the coconut meat into smaller pieces. Your blender will do most of the work for you, but your coconut meat needs to be in small enough bits for your blender to get to it. Try 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes or smaller. You can use as many or as few coconuts as you want. Keep in mind that it takes quite a few coconuts to make a small amount of oil and different methods will produce different amounts of oil. For instance, 3-4 coconuts will likely only produce 0.25 cups (59 mL) of coconut oil.\n2. Add the coconut pieces to a blender and pour in water. You may need to blend your coconut in batches if you're processing a lot of coconuts at once. Only fill the blender about 1/3 of the way with coconut. Pour in enough hot water to completely cover the coconut with an extra 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so of water on top. Boil some water and then mix it with cool water so it's hot but not so hot that you can't touch it. Some people use cold water for extraction. However, you won't get as much oil from the coconut with cold water.\n3. Pulse and blend the mixture until smooth. Place the lid on the blender. Push the \"Pulse\" button 3-4 times and then set it on high. Keep blending until it looks like it's a smooth, homogeneous mixture. This process produces coconut milk.\n4. Strain the mixture through a sieve. Pour the coconut milk through a fine mesh sieve. As the mixture drains, use your hands to squeeze the pulp or chaff left behind to make sure you're getting all the milk out of it. You may need to sieve it more than once to get all the chaff out. You can also use a nut milk bag, which is specifically made for making nut milks. It's made of fine cloth, and you can squeeze the whole bag to release the milk. Alternatively, you can just use a piece of cheesecloth or muslin over a sieve, then pick up the chaff and cloth together to squeeze it out.\n5. Repeat the grinding process a second time to get all of the milk out. Put the chaff back in the blender with more water. Grind it again until it's smooth, and then pour it through the sieve. This will help release the rest of the coconut milk. You can use the pulp or chaff in other dishes that call for coconut flakes.\n6. Place the milk in the refrigerator so the cream can rise to the top. Leave the coconut milk in the refrigerator for at least 2-3 hours. When it's ready, you'll see the coconut cream on the top in a hard crust.\n7. Skim the coconut cream from the top of the container. Use a knife to gently slice through the coconut cream on top and run the knife around the edges. Pull the pieces of coconut cream off the top of the milk, doing your best to leave the rest of the milk behind. You can cook rice or other foods in the liquid left behind, which will add more flavor to the food.\n\n\n## Cook the mixture to separate the oil from the water\n\n1. Put the coconut cream in a pot over low heat. Don't let the mixture smoke, as you could burn the oil. Pick a stainless steel pot or something similar. Avoid using non-stick pans for this process.\n2. Cook the coconut milk for at least an hour, stirring every 5-10 minutes. You will see the oil start to separate from the solids, which will be white at first. Over time, the water will boil off and the solids will start to turn brown. Once the solids are dark brown and the oil is completely separated, you're done with the cooking process. Stir the mixture occasionally.\n3. Pour the mixture through cheesecloth, muslin, or a fine-mesh sieve. The sieve will remove the dark brown bits from the oil. Once the oil is clear, pour it into a container of your choice. Let it cool, then store it in the refrigerator or in your cupboard and use it in your favorite dishes. Put it in a container that you can spoon it out from easily, as it will likely solidify.\n\n\n## Make cold-pressed oil\n\n1. Put the coconut cream in a jar and keep it warm overnight. Add hot water bottles to the sides for warmth. You can place it in a cooler or put blankets over it to help keep it warm. This will begin the separation process, removing the water from the oil.\n2. Place the jar in the refrigerator the next day to separate the cream. Check on it after a few hours. The cream will form a hard layer on top if it's separated. If it has, pull it from the refrigerator. Use a knife or spoon to scoop the hard part into a new jar. You can discard the water or use it for cooking.\n3. Keep the mixture warm overnight again and then strain it. Place it back in the insulated area with hot water bottles. Once again, the curd will separate from the liquid below. In the morning, pull the jar out. Strain the mixture through cheesecloth and a metal strainer into a new jar. Don't squeeze the curd during this process. Let it drip out.\n4. Refrigerate and separate the oil one more time. Leave the mixture in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours. When it looks separated, pull the jar out. The hard part on top will be the oil. Use a knife or spoon to pull it out into a new jar, and you're finished with the oil. It's best to refrigerate this kind of oil, as it's hard to get all of the water out. Water can spoil the oil.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual who is interested in DIY projects, cooking, or alternative sources of oil.

{"conversations": ["How to prevent your teen from joining a gang?", "Gangs can be a very bad influence on a teen.  Teens often want to join a gang because of certain issues such as racism, poverty, loneliness, and media influences. You can prevent your teen from joining a gang by education about the appeal of gangs for teens, talking and listening to your teen, and getting involved in your own community.\n\n## Educate yourself\n\n1. Learn the appeal of gangs. There are many reasons why a teen might join a gang. Learning the potential draw of gangs for teens can help you identify if your teen is at risk. Teens might seek out gangs for a feeling of belonging. If your teen feels like an outsider for any reason, he or she may seek out a gang for a sense of community. Peer pressure is also a major factor in teens joining gangs. If your teen has friends who are in a gang or associated with one, your teen may consider joining as well. Teens also don't always realize the danger of gangs. The idea of being part of a gang might be exciting, especially if your teen has been exposed to video games and other media that glorifies gang violence. If your teen has an underlying mental illness, such as a personality disorder, he or she might seek thrills through joining a gang.\n2. Investigate gang activity in your area. Location is a big risk factor when it comes to your teen joining a gang. Be aware of any gang activity in your area so you know what your teen might be exposed to at school or in the community. You can research gang activity in your area by browsing police reports and police data online. Most areas have a police blotter website where you can enter your zip code and see of any recent arrests or disturbances in your area. Talk to officials at your teen's school. Principals and superintendents should be aware if there is any gang activity occurring in their jurisdiction. Make an appointment with an official at the school and ask him or her about gang activity. Many people feel certain locations make them immune to gangs. If you live in the suburbs, for example, you might think your teen is immune to gang violence. However, in a lot of big cities gangs eventually move into the suburbs. In the Chicago suburb Evanston, for example, gang activity has been on the rise in the last few years. Be vigilant about potential gang activity regardless of your location.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the warning signs your teen is involved with a gang. Make sure you know the warnings signs regarding gang activity in teens. You should be concerned if your teen is displaying any of the following signs:\n\t* Wearing a certain color or color scheme suddenly\n\t* An increased interest in gangs, gangster music, and gangster movies\n\t* Bragging about having friends in gangs\n\t* Coming home with expensive items\n\t* Using hand gestures and signs to communicate with friends\n\t* Aggressive or withdrawn behavior\n\n\n## Work with your teen\n\n1. Talk to your teen about gangs. Education is key to keeping your teen from joining a gang. Take time to sit down and talk to your teen about the dangers of gangs. Be as frank as possible when discussing gangs with your teens. Explain that, short term, gang activity can lead to trouble with police, trouble with school, and poor relationships with family members. Longterm, make sure your teen knows gang activity can prevent them having access to education and employment options, time in jail, and a risk to their personal safety and the personal safety of their family and friends. Listen as well. Your teen may be compelled to argue or even disregard what you're saying. Try to understand why your teen is resisting. Is he or she being intimidated by a gang? Is a person your teen looks up to in a gang? Understanding the reasons gang membership is appealing to teens can help you better address the problem.\n2. Keep your teen engaged in other activities. Teens often join gangs for a sense of community or for some excitement. Keeping your teen as engaged in other activities as possible can lessen the draw of gangs. Encourage your teen to engage in activities that appeal to his or her interest. Is your teen always sketching or drawing? Enroll him or her in art classes. Is your teen athletic? Encourage him or her to join a school sports team. Is your teen interested in music? Invest in a piano, guitar, or other musical instrument. Push your teen to find an after school job. While some teens might resist the notion of working, emphasize how building a work ethic can help later on. Talk about what your teen could do with all the extra spending money. Allow your teen to have friends over at your house. You want your teen to feel most comfortable at home, where it's safe. This also gives you an opportunity to get to know your teen and his or her peers. You can encourage wholesome activities, like board games and age appropriate movies, over the kinds of activities that might land your teen in trouble.\n3. Learn how to best communicate with a teen. Communicating with teenager can be difficult. Most teens feel an increased need for autonomy and independence, which means they may pull away and rebel against you. However, learning the means to effectively communicate with a teen can help. Always listen without judgment. If your teen is willing to share something with you, let him or her. Try to stay calm and listen, even if your concerned by what your teen is saying. Remember, as a parent you're better off hearing bad news than not hearing it. Being reactionary and harsh can discourage your teen from reaching out when in need. Respect your teen's sense of privacy and autonomy. Unless you suspect a serious problem, allow your teen his or her own space. Let them have a bedroom to themselves. Do not always ask who your teen is calling or texting on the phone. Do not touch your teen's belonging without permission. Schedule times to talk. You do not need to schedule a weekly conversation, but having a family dinner night or board game night gives your teen the opportunity to share. Strive to keep communication open and keep yourself available when your teen is in need.\n4. Identify positive role models for your teen. Teens often join gangs because they feel lost. Lacking positive role models, a teen might turn to the allure of a gang. Identify positive roll models for your teen. Get your teen involved in the community. Encourage him or her to volunteer. Take him or her to church, town hall meetings, and other places and meetings you attend. Teach your teen about people you admire. This can be someone you know personally, like your great-grandmother who supported her family during the Great Depression. It can also be a public figure, like a politician or activist. Showing your teen what you believe admirable qualities constitute can lessen the appeal of gang members.\n\n\n## Improve your community\n\n1. Remove gang related graffiti. Graffiti is often a way for gangs to advertise and recruit new members. If you notice new or unusual graffiti in your area, google the images to see if they're gang affiliated. If they are, talk to the local police about having them removed as soon as possible. Depending on regulations in your area, you may be able to remove the images yourself or schedule a community cleanup. Stop by the local courthouse and ask what your options are in terms of arranging a cleanup.\n2. Team up with other parents. The phrase \"It takes a village to raise a child\" exists for a reason. You cannot do this alone. Work with other parents to build a stronger community and to keep out gangs. Schedule a meeting with other parents in town to discuss gang activity in your area. Brainstorm ideas about how to keep your teens out of gangs. Working together, you and other parents can create regular community events and activities for teens to engage in in order to discourage them from joining gangs. You can also go, as a group, to a PTA to raise any concerns you have about gang activity in the school system. Look into starting a neighborhood watch to keep on the lookout for gang activity.\n3. Take political action. In order to address gang activity, political action may be necessary. Increasing law enforcement presence in your are and providing community outreach to at-risk teens may be needed in your area. Start letter writing and phone campaigns to local members of Congress. Explain why your area needs help addressing gang violence and gang activity. Demand community outreach in your area. Raise awareness. Buy an ad on the local radio. Hand out pamphlets at community centers, schools, churches, grocery stores, and other areas. A single call to local police about gang activity has little effect. A collective group effort is necessary to stomping out gang activity in your area. Make sure other parents on board with talking to the police together.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned parent or guardian who is seeking advice and guidance on how to help their teen avoid the negative influences of gang culture.

Inspecting your chain with your bike's wheels facing upwards will make it more comfortable for you to inspect and work on. If you don't have a rack, simply lean your bike upright against a wall.\n2. Take a picture of the chain. To make the reinstallation process easier, take a picture of the chain so you can refer to it later. Make sure your picture shows how the chain feeds through the gear mechanism.\n3. Check for a master link. A master link is a special link in your bike chain that has a pin/slot configuration that will allow you to easily remove your chain from the bike. Two popular kinds of master links are Connex and SRAM Powerlink. Knowing where your master link is ahead of time will make chain replacement go smoother. The master link for a bike is specific to the chain size and brand. If your bike does not have a master link, you can install one yourself or have it done at your local bike shop. This installation is usually inexpensive, costing about $15 in most cases. If your bike does not have a master link and you prefer not to have one installed, order a chain-tool to remove the chain. They're inexpensive and essential pieces of equipment.\n4. Position your chain. This is especially important if you have a master link. Removing a master link that's positioned on the teeth of the chain ring or a gear can be very difficult. Positioning the master link so it is suspended at the midpoint between the crankset and the rear wheel will be easiest. If you are using a chain tool, you can still benefit from proper chain positioning. Some parts of your chain will be dirtier or have more wear than others. A clear segment of chain positioned at the midpoint between the wheels will be easiest to remove with your chain tool.\n5. Remove the chain. Now that the chain is in position, you can remove it. If you have a master link, use master-link pliers or your hands to squeeze both ends of the master link inwards so the pin comes out of its slot and the link comes apart, freeing your chain. If you're using a chain tool:\n\t* Set the chain tool on the link you are trying to remove so it aligns with one of the round holes to either side of the link. Screw the chain tool so it moves through the hole. This will push out the pin that is keeping that link together. Try not to push the pin completely free of the link. This will make it difficult, or in some cases impossible, to reassemble that link of the chain. You'll often feel a popping or snapping when the pin pushes free of the link. This is a good indicator that the link has been disengaged. Some chain tools are only intended for certain sized links, though some can be used on several different sizes of chain. Check the instructions on your chain tool before using it.\n\n\n## Attach your new chain\n\n1. Avoid using failed chains as replacements. Chains generally fail because they have reached their limit or been put under too much stress. Replacing a failed chain on your bike could result in an even more severe failure down the road. To prevent injury to yourself or your mountain bike, you should buy a new chain instead of reusing old ones. Bike chains can be bought at your local bike shop or, in some cases, your local hardware store.\n2. Measure your replacement chain. It's important that you only use the kind of chain intended for your bike. For example, an 11-speed bike will use an 11-speed chain. Hang your old bike chain so it dangles freely and do the same with your new chain beside the old one. Count the number of links if your new chain is longer than the old. This will be the number of links you need to remove. If your chain has snapped and it is unreliable to measure your new chain, you can remove links after feeding the chain into the drivetrain of your bike.\n3. Insert your chain into the gear mechanism. For more complex mountain bike, you may need to consult the picture you took of how the old chain feeds through the gear mechanism to do this properly. Simple mechanisms may be more intuitive. Pull the chain through the entire drivetrain until both ends terminate at the bottom midpoint between your wheels. Positioning the ends of your chain at the bottom midpoint between the wheels of your bike will make it more accessible and allow gravity to keep the chain on the bike until you can secure it.\n4. Remove extra links from the chain, if necessary. If your chain is loose, you'll need to remove some links. This is likely the case if you were not able to measure your chain. Shift your bike to its lowest gear, and then use your chain tool to remove links one at a time to shorten the chain until it is taut in the drivetrain. When removing extra links, avoid popping the pin holding them together completely free of the link. This will make it difficult to reattach the link if you shorten it too much. For the best ride, you'll need the chain to be strung tautly between the wheels in its lowest gear.\n5. Attach the loose ends of your chain. With a master link, all you need to do is slip the pin of the link into its slot to complete the link. If you removed your chain with a chain tool, you'll have to re-couple the split link by lining up its halves together and using a pair of pliers to force the pin back through the hole to complete the link. You should feel a click or a pop when the pin of a master link slides into place. You can also pull on the chain to either side of the link to securely seat the pin of the master link in place.\n6. Test your chain. Reposition your bike back on its rack and move the pedals manually with your hands to run the chain through the drivetrain of your bicycle. The chain should move smoothly. If you notice stiff links, these are often caused by a protruding link pin, and can be fixed by resetting the pin with your chain tool and pliers. Cycle the suspension by sitting on the saddle and bouncing up and down a few times to test your chain length. To protect your chain from the elements and to help it run smoothly in your drive train, you should lubricate your chain with a suitable bicycle chain lubricant.\n\n\n## Inspect your chain for wear\n\n1. Use a chain wear indicator to evaluate your chain for best results. You can find a chain wear indicator at your local bike shop or maybe even at a hardware store. You'll have to attach the indicator between the links of your chain and follow the directions on it to interpret its reading. Most chain wear indicators will have a sticker that establishes the values for a worn chain and an unworn chain. If your wear indicator does not, check the box it came in for these values. If you do not have a wear indicator, you can perform a hand check of the chain. Use moderate pressure to lift a section of your chain from the chainring of your bike with your fingers. A small gap should form between the chain and the ring. If you can clearly see through the gap over three or four teeth, your chain is worn.\n2. Try to join the ends of your chain to test for wear as a simpler alternative. If inspecting your chain with a wear indicator or a physical gap check aren't an option, or if your chain is already off the bike, you can also check for wear by trying to touch the ends of the bike chain. Lay your chain on a clean surface so that the holes in the chain are oriented up and down. Then:\n\t* Try to touch the ends of the chain together while keeping the holes facing up and down. Over time, chains are bent by the action of your bikes derailleur. Note the amount of sideways flex in your chain. A worn chain will have a great deal flexion. Newer chains resist touching and only arc slightly.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the drivetrain. The drivetrain of your bike is the part that transfers the energy you put into the pedals through the chain to your gears to move the wheels. You'll want to pay extra close attention to how the chain feeds into the gears. Knowing how the chain fits in the mechanism will allow you to replace it with greater ease.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An enthusiastic mountain biker who has recently encountered a problem with their bike's chain.

{"conversations": ["How to deal with a bipolar person?", "## Help someone with bipolar disorder\n\n1. Watch for symptoms. If the person has already been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, then you may know all about the symptoms of this condition already. Bipolar disorder is characterized by periods of mania and depression. During manic phases, someone may seem to have boundless energy and during depressive phases, that same person might not get out of bed for days. Manic phases may be characterized by high levels of optimism or irritability, unrealistic ideas about one\u2019s abilities, feeling energetic despite getting little sleep, speaking rapidly and going quickly from one idea to the next, not being able to concentrate, making impulsive or poor decisions, and even hallucinating. Depressive phases are characterized by hopelessness, sadness, emptiness, irritability, losing interest in things, fatigue, lack of concentration, appetite changes, weight changes, difficulty sleeping, feeling worthless or guilty, and considering suicide.\n2. Consider the differences in bipolar disorder types. Bipolar disorder is divided into four subtypes. These definitions can help mental health practitioners to identify the disorder whether the symptoms are mild or severe. The four subtypes are:\n\t* \n\t* Bipolar I Disorder. This subtype is characterized by manic episodes that last for seven days or that are severe enough that the person needs hospitalization. These episodes are followed by depressive episodes that last at least two weeks. Bipolar II Disorder. This subtype is characterized by depressive episodes followed by mild manic episodes, but these episodes are not severe enough to warrant hospitalization. Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (BP-NOS). This subtype is when someone has symptoms of bipolar disorder, but they do not meet the criteria for a bipolar I or II diagnosis. Cyclothymia. This subtype is when someone has had symptoms of bipolar disorder for two years, but the symptoms are mild.\n3. Communicate your concerns. If you think that someone may be suffering from bipolar disorder, then you should say something. When you approach the person, make sure that you do so from a standpoint of concern and not judgment. Remember that bipolar disorder is a mental illness and the person cannot control their behaviors. Try saying something like, \u201cI care about you and I have noticed that you have been struggling lately. I want to you to know that I am here for you and I want to help.\u201d\n4. Offer to listen. Someone with bipolar disorder may feel comforted by having someone who is willing to listen to how they are feeling. Make sure that the person knows that you are happy to listen if they want to talk. When you listen, do not judge the person or try to solve their problems. Just listen and offer some genuine encouragement. For example, you might say something like, \u201cIt sounds like you have been having a really hard time. I don\u2019t know how you feel, but I care about you and I want to help you.\u201d\n5. Make a doctor\u2019s appointment. The person may be incapable of making an appointment for themselves due to the symptoms of bipolar disorder, so one way that you can help is by offering to make a doctor\u2019s appointment. If the person is resistant to the idea of seeking help for the disorder, then do not try to force them. Instead, you may consider making an appointment for your the person to have a general health check-up and see if the person feels compelled to ask the doctor about the symptoms they have been having.\n6. Encourage the person to take prescribed medications. If the person has been prescribed medications to help control their bipolar symptoms, then make sure that they take those medications. It is common for people with bipolar disorder to stop taking their medications because they feel better or because they miss having manic phases. Remind the person that the medications are necessary and that stopping them may make things worse.\n7. Try to be patient. Even though there may be some improvement in the person\u2019s bipolar disorder after a few months of treatment, recovering from bipolar disorder can take years. There may also be setbacks along the way, so try to be patient with your the person as they recover.\n8. Take time for yourself. Supporting someone who has bipolar disorder can take a large toll on you, so make sure that you take time for yourself. Make sure that you have some time away from the person every day. For example, you might go to an exercise class, meet a friend for coffee, or read a book. You may also consider seeking counseling to help you deal with the stress and emotional strain of supporting someone with bipolar disorder.\n\n\n## Deal with mania\n\n1. Be a calming presence. During a manic episode, a person with bipolar disorder may become over stimulated or irritated by long conversations or certain topics. Try to talk to the person in a calming way and avoid engaging in an argument or lengthy discussion about something. Try not to bring up anything that might trigger the person\u2019s mania. For example, you might want to avoid asking about something that is stressful for the individual or a goal that the person has been trying to accomplish. Instead, talk about the weather, a TV show, or something else that is unlikely to stress the person.\n2. Encourage the person to get lots of rest. During a manic phase, the person may feel like they only need a few hours of sleep to feel rested. However, not getting enough sleep may make matters worse. Try to encourage the person to sleep as much as possible at night and to take naps during the day if needed.\n3. Go for walks. Taking walks with your the person during manic episodes can be a good way to help them use excess energy and provide a good opportunity for the two of you to talk as well. Try to invite the person to go on a walk with you once per day or at least a few times per week. Regular exercise can also help when someone is having symptoms of depression, so try to encourage exercise no matter what the person\u2019s mood is like.\n4. Watch for impulsive behavior. During manic episodes, the person may be prone to impulsive behavior such as drug use, shopping in excess, or going on a long trip. Try to encourage the person to think a bit longer before making any major purchases or starting a new project when they are in the midst of a manic episode. If overspending is often an issue, then you might encourage the person to leave credit cards and extra cash at home when these episodes strike. If drinking or using drugs seems to intensify the situation, then you might encourage the person to avoid using alcohol or other substances.\n5. Try not to take comments personally. When someone is in the middle of a manic period, they may say hurtful things or try to start arguments with you. Try not to take these comments personally and do not engage in arguments with the person. Remind yourself that these comments are due to the illness and do not represent how the person really feels.\n\n\n## Deal with depression\n\n1. Suggest working towards a small goal. During a depressive episode, it may be hard for the person to accomplish large goals, so setting small manageable goals may help. Accomplishing a small goal may also help the person feel better. For example, if the person is complaining that she needs to clean her whole house, then you might suggest just tackling something small like a coat closet or bathroom.\n2. Encourage positive strategies for dealing with depression. When someone is depressed, it may be tempting to turn to negative coping mechanisms, such as alcohol, isolating oneself, or not taking medications. Instead, try to encourage the person to use positive coping mechanisms. For example, you can suggest calling their therapist, doing a little exercise, or engaging in a hobby when a depressive mood strikes.\n3. Provide genuine encouragement. Encouraging the person during depressive phases will help them to know that someone there cares. Make sure that you avoid making promises or relying on clich\u00e9s when you encourage your friend or the person. For example, don\u2019t say, \u201cEverything will be fine,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all in your head,\u201d or \u201cWhen life give you lemons, make lemonade!\u201d\n\t* Instead, say things like, \u201cI care about you,\u201d \u201cI am here for you,\u201d \u201cYou are a good person and I am happy that you are in my life.\u201d\n4. Try to establish a routine. During depressive phases, the person may prefer to stay in bed, isolate themselves, or just watch TV all day. Do your best to help the person establish a daily routine so that they always have something to do. For example, you might establish a time for your the person to get up and shower, a time to go get the mail, a time to take a walk, and time to do something fun, like reading a book or playing a game.\n5. Watch for signs that the person may be suicidal. During depressive phases, people are more prone to thoughts of suicide. Make sure that you take any comments about suicide seriously. If the person is acting suicidal or indicating that they have plans to kill themselves and/or harm others, then call emergency services for help. Do not try to deal with someone who is suicidal or violent on your own.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned individual seeking advice on how to support and care for someone with bipolar disorder.

{"conversations": ["How to treat arthritis in horses?", "Arthritis is a painful joint problem that affects horses as well as humans. If your four-legged friend is suffering from the problem, supplements and medications can provide some relief from painful inflammation. Making lifestyle changes, like light exercise and farrier work, can also increase your horse\u2019s comfort and quality of life. Since arthritis is almost impossible to stop, it is important to keep in touch with a veterinarian for advice on continued treatment.\n\n## Make lifestyle change\n\n1. Consult your veterinarian. A vet will need to examine your horse and assess the factors that might be contributing to its arthritis, including age, diet, and activity level. This will help them determine the right medication and lifestyle changes to prescribe your horse. Your vet may take x-rays to assess the severity of your horse\u2019s arthritis and make further suggestions for treatment.\n2. Control the horse\u2019s weight. If your horse is overweight, this will put additional strain on its joints, worsening pain and discomfort. Help your horse lower its weight, if necessary, then feed it a nutritious but lean diet to keep its weight down. Keeping an older horse nourished can be difficult because their nutritional needs and ability to digest food may change. Always ask your vet for advice before making major changes in your horse\u2019s diet.\n3. Don\u2019t keep your horse confined to the stable. Arthritic horses will probably be reluctant or unable to move like they once did. Keeping them indoors, however, will actually make the problem worse. Provide a large pasture for them to roam and graze about to keep the joints moving and prevent the horse from getting too stiff.Regular light exercise, such as trail riding, will be good for your horse, and limit the effects of arthritis.\n4. Talk to your farrier. The condition of a horse\u2019s hooves and shoes are critical to its movement and comfort, and this is especially the case for one suffering from arthritis. Let your farrier know that the horse is having problems with arthritis, and they may make recommendations that will keep its hooves in good condition and make it more comfortable.\n\n\n## Try supplement and medications\n\n1. Give your horse feed supplements. A number of nutritional supplements are available, including glucosamine and hyaluronic acid. These can be given to your horse along with its food to help alleviate some of the symptoms of arthritis, like pain and stiffness. Look for feed supplements at a supply store, or ask your vet. Feed supplements are a simple option to try at first. However, they are not regulated, and they are not guaranteed to be effective. Ask your vet what they recommend for your horse based on the severity of your horse's issues\n2. Try injectable joint products. Some products, including polysulfated glycosaminoglycans (Adequan) and sodium hyaluronate (Legend) can be injected directly into the affected joint to give your horse some relief. A vet may also recommend injecting the joint with steroids or hyaluronic acid. These products can give immediate relief. In some cases, their benefits can last for months or years. Your vet will sterilize the area to be injected and inject the correct steroid and acid combination. Once you go down the road of injecting a joint, you will likely have to inject the same joint again in the future to keep your horse comfortable.\n3. Ask about joint projectants. Arthritis is caused by a combination of inflammation and degeneration (breaking down) at affected joints. In addition to the products that provide relief from painful inflammation, ones like glucosamine and chondroitin can help protect the joint itself from damage. Your vet can prescribe the right product for your horse.\n4. Supply pain relievers. Some products, including phenylbutazone and firocoxib, won\u2019t treat the joint itself, but will provide your horse with some general pain relief. Your vet will prescribe these for your horse if they believe the medicine will improve the horse\u2019s quality of life. Use painkillers as directed by your veterinarian. Giving pain medication more frequently than recommended or in too large a quantity can damage your horse\u2019s gastrointestinal tract and cause kidney or liver failure.\n5. Expect the issue to progress over time. Medications can definitely help a horse be more comfortable, and caring well for your horse can increase its quality of life. However, it is almost impossible to repair the damage caused by arthritis. Over time, problems caused by arthritis will increase, so it is important to stay in touch with your vet about continued treatment.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A veterinarian, horse owner, or equine enthusiast with a keen interest in equine health and wellness.

{"conversations": ["How to help make cellulite less visible?", "Have cellulite? Don't worry: Almost all women have it. However, few if any women want it. There are ways you can reduce the orange peel-like dimpling that occurs on the skin, usually on the legs, thighs and butt. It\u2019s a myth that cellulite is always tied to obesity. Some thin people still have cellulite. However, your chances of cellulite grow with obesity, so exercise and choosing a healthier diet matters.\n\n## Make cellulite less obvious\n\n1. Get a tan. Whether it\u2019s a spray tan or a natural one, tanned butts and legs don\u2019t show cellulite as much. If you already have a dark complexion, you\u2019re lucky because darker skin doesn\u2019t show cellulite as much as pale skin does. Always take caution when tanning, though. The sun\u2019s rays can lead to skin cancer, so it's usually a better choice to get an authentic looking fake tan. There are many ways to do this: airbrush or booth spray tanning at a salon and home products such as foam, lotion, or spray. When applying tanning lotion, start by exfoliating the skin with a body scrub, as well as shaving any areas where you don't want hair. Then, using gloves, apply the lotion all over your body, starting with the head area, and taking care not to get it into your eyes. Apply petroleum jelly to your eyebrows to prevent them from becoming discolored. When spray tanning, it\u2019s very important that you wear recommended protective gear (over eyes, nose, and other body openings) so you don\u2019t ingest the tanning particles during the process. If using a booth, you will be instructed to turn inside the booth as a nozzle sprays you with the solution.\n2. Start toning your legs. While genetics might make you more susceptible to cellulite, toned legs with strong muscle definition tend to show cellulite less. Run up a staircase, go for a long walk or jog, and use a stair master or elliptical trainer. All of these exercises and equipment target the leg and butt areas where cellulite resides. Contrary to popular myth, cellulite is not caused by toxins in the body. It\u2019s caused by a lack of exercise and muscle tone, excess fat, poor circulation, genetics and hormones. Leg lifts and squats are among the exercises that can help you tone your legs.\n3. Strength train. Although running and other cardio can reduce your weight, which can make cellulite less obvious, strength training will be best at getting rid of the dimpled look. Yoga routines help tone the body and reduce the appearance of cellulite, as do strength-training routines that build muscle. Studies have shown that people who combine cardio with strength training (weight lifting, some circuit training routines) added muscle in addition to losing fat, and improved the overall look of their bodies. As little as 15 minutes of cardio (such as running) and 15 minutes of strength training (such as weight lifting) three times a week can make a difference over time (at least eight weeks).\n4. Try anti-cellulite clothing. It doesn\u2019t work for everyone, but some clothing manufacturers make clothing marketed to reduce the look of cellulite. These pieces of clothing, such as capri leggings, are designed to generate heat that in turn helps break down cellulite cells. Elastic underwear has the opposite effect; it can make cellulite look worse. Wear non-elastic undergarments made of smooth fabric. Loose fitting clothing helps reduce cellulite because tighter clothing impairs blood flow throughout the day.\n\n\n## Improve the diet to reduce cellulite\n\n1. Drink a lot of green tea. Green tea has many health benefits. Some people drink it as part of weight reduction efforts, but it can also reduce the sight of cellulite. Green tea is a good choice for people who find it boring to drink plain water all day long. You can drink it cold or hot. Green tea doesn\u2019t add many calories to your daily intake, but it\u2019s very rich in antioxidants. The tea will increase your metabolism. Cellulite can occur with age because it\u2019s associated with lower production of estrogen in the body. Drinking a lot of green tea can help reduce this effect. A faster metabolism means that your body should be able to expel toxins faster, which will reduce the look of cellulite.\n2. Drink a lot of water. There are many, many proven benefits to guzzling water. You should drink water all day long. Stay hydrated. Hydrated bodies won\u2019t have cellulite that looks so obvious. Other health benefits include shinier hair and younger looking skin. If you find drinking plain water too boring, add a lemon slice into it. It\u2019s a good idea to drink two liters of water every day and to drink water constantly throughout the day. Drinking a lot of water can also help with weight loss, which can further reduce cellulite. That\u2019s because when people feel hungry, sometimes it just means they are dehydrated.\n3. Avoid sugary beverages. Drinking beverages loaded with sugar will probably make cellulite worse (not to mention it can increase your weight). That means you should avoid carbonated sodas but also be aware of drinks that have hidden sugars, such as fruit juices. Study labels. Some beverage companies are experts at packaging and marketing and they might make you think that energy or fruit drink is healthy \u2013 until you read the label and see that it\u2019s loaded with sugar and carbs. It\u2019s always better to choose water than sugary beverages. Even diet sodas aren\u2019t great for the body because they have carbonation and chemicals.\n4. Try natural remedies. There are many natural remedies that some people swear help with cellulite. Give one of them a try and see if they work for you. Refrigerate the residue from your coffee grinds (black coffee). Mix them with olive oil to create a scrub that you apply to the cellulite-impacted area. Use circular motions to apply the rub for about 15 minutes. Then, leave the grinds on your body for about 15-20 minutes more before washing them away. Cover and warm the region with shrink wrap. Instead of coffee grounds, you could use salt and grapefruit juice to create a similar rub that some people say helps with cellulite.\n5. Eat healthier foods. Reducing the amount of toxins in your diet is good for many reasons. You will likely lose weight, be healthier, and your cellulite will reduce. Consume alkaline forming foods. Alkaline is found in fresh fruit and vegetables, which should make up the majority of your diet if you want to eat healthier. Sprinkle flaxseed on your breakfast to boost collagen growth. Sprinkle two tablespoons of it on oatmeal or yogurt. Fresh vegetable juicing is one way you can flood your body with healthy juice. Avoid eating processed foods as much as possible, especially foods that come in boxes and that are loaded with carbohydrates or sugar. Drink lemon juice and cayenne pepper three times a day.\n6. Eat kelp. Kelp can help you lose weight as well as improve the appearance of cellulite. It contains a chemical found in green plants that helps the body burn fat. Purchase dried kelp and add it to stir fries, soup or salad. You can also ingest kelp vitamins. Consider kelp \"sea vegetables.\" The kelp retains the minerals that are found in the ocean, making it very healthy for you. Kelp, sometimes called seaweed, also balances out the thyroid gland, improving your health. It's often found in Asian cooking.\n7. Stay away from too much salt or sugar. Salt and sugar can lead to serious health problems, as well as obesity, which makes cellulite more obvious. Avoid eating too much refined salt. Crystal and sea salt are healthier. Refined salt dehydrates the body and leaches minerals out of it. Sodium also causes the body to retain fluids, making cellulite look worse. Sodium can harm your health. Try to limit your sugar consumption to 6 teaspoons a day and your salt consumption to 200 mg of sodium.\n\n\n## Use chemical and other tool to reduce cellulite\n\n1. Try lasers. Some beauty salons and plastic surgeons offer treatments for cellulite that use lasers and other mechanical devices. There are downsides to these methods. They are often expensive, they need to be repeated regularly, they have to be done by a trained professional and can be painful. One example: Cellulaze is a procedure approved by the FDA for cellulite. A small laser is inserted under the skin to break down the cellulite\u2019s structure. Research carefully any such interventions and check into the licensing and ratings of the salon performing the functions, as well as the credentials and training of the person administering it. Laser toning and cold-laser massage are also techniques that are said to reduce the appearance of cellulite. The tri-active laser was approved by the FDA and claims to temporarily reduce cellulite\u2019s appearance. Fillers are sometimes used to treat cellulite dimples.\n2. Try a lotion. Many products advertise that they can help improve cellulite. Not all are that successful, but you could give them a try. You might find temporary help from ingredients that dilate blood and lymph vessels. Black pepper, green tea, ginger, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and ginkgo fall into this category, and some anti-cellulite creams contain them. Ointments containing forskolin (which comes from the herb coleus forskohlii) were found in one study to help women lose excess skin from their thighs. Skin firming cream can help build up collagen and diminish wrinkles. Some cellulite creams contain retinol, coenzyme Q10, and vitamin C. Major brands like Lancome, L\u2019Oreal, and Nivea offer gels and lotions that are said to firm up the skin.\n3. Massage the affected area. Not only do massages feel great, but they are also known to reduce the look of unsightly cellulite dimples. Use a body brush with boar or just stiff bristles in a circular motion while you take a shower. Or use a hand-held massagers. Apply the massage head to the areas with cellulite. Add a skin firming serum, body lotion or anti-cellulite gel before you apply the massaging motions. Cellulite is caused by fat deposits that push through the skin\u2019s connective tissue, usually in the buttocks and thighs. Massaging the skin stimulates the lymphatic system that lies right underneath the skin\u2019s surface. This circulates toxins and causes the body to release them more quickly. Add a few drops of olive and juniper oil to the skin before massaging it.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A woman in her late 30s or early 40s who is concerned about her physical appearance, particularly cellulite on her body.

{"conversations": ["How to make your linkedin profile stand out?", "LinkedIn has become a key tool for many recruiters to search for qualified candidates and for job seekers to make the right connections when seeking a job. The site allows each person to create a profile that can serve at as an online resume and minimal portfolio. You can make your LinkedIn profile stand out by ensuring that the basics of your profile are rock solid, and then going the extra mile to make it exemplary.\n\n## Start with the basics\n\n1. Add a professional profile picture to catch the eye of recruiters. Your profile picture must be professional in order to give a good first impression. If you have use a profile picture that is inappropriate or silly, recruiters will probably remove you from their candidate list immediately. When choosing a profile picture, remember to choose one that:\n\t* Does not include anyone else but you. This reduces confusion regarding who the profile is about and draws all the focus to you. Is just of your head and shoulders. Your profile picture is a small picture and will show your face better if you limit it's scope to just your head and shoulders. Shows you wearing professional business attire. LinkedIn is a professional site. Wearing business attire in your picture is highly recommended. This includes a nice collared shirt and a suit jacket if you wish (for both men and women) or an unrevealing blouse for women. Is in front of a solid background. Solid backgrounds allow the focus to be on you and not what is going on behind you. Has a smile. A smile can make you seem more approachable to those who don't know you. Is preferably taken by someone else. It is OK if it is not done by a professional, but definitely no selfies.\n2. Write an eye-catching headline to draw readers in. Headlines are automatically filled with your most recent job title after you add your experience. These can be boring, and you should consider changing your headline to something more unique. To make yourself stand out, edit your headline to tell the reader who you are and what you are an expert in. For example, \u201cOperations Executive\", \"Performance Driven, Airline Industry Expert\u201d.\n3. Customize your URL to brand yourself. Customizing your URL allows you to reference your LinkedIn page easily in your resume or on business cards and other documents. It should remain simple, with the best kind of URL including just your first and last name with no spaces or special characters. For example, www.linkedin.com/in/firstlastname.\n4. Provide an outstanding summary to highlight your talents. Writing a LinkedIn summary is much like writing a professional biography. It should be brief, yet comprehensive enough to give the reader an overview of your career thus far. Also, it should be well-written and engaging to entice them to read through your profile further and accept or request to connect with you. While writing a summary, remember to include the following:\n\t* Tell your story in the first person. This means using the words I, my and mine to make your summary more conversational and easy to read. Explain your expertise and interests. Use examples to show your value to potential clients and future employers. Highlight your key accomplishments. If you have made some great achievements in your career, take the time to list these in your summary. For example, Top Sales Award Winner. State a call to action. Explain what you are looking for while making connections on LinkedIn. For example, \u201copen to new opportunities\u201d, \u201clooking to make mutually beneficial connections\u201d or \u201ccontact me if I can be assistance to you\u201d.\n5. List each job you have held with a summary of tasks to provide detail. As with your resume, list all the jobs you have held. The difference between a LinkedIn profile and a resume is that it is acceptable to add any and all jobs to your experience section, rather than limiting yourself to what is most relevant to the particular job you are applying for, as with a resume. Also, you are also not limited to the 10 year rule as you would be on a resume. Therefore, feel free to list any job you have ever held in your career. Add a brief summary of the purpose of your job and the major tasks you have completed. Bullet key accomplishments. As with a resume, you want to highlight your strengths and accomplishments to show you were successful at your job. For example, \u201cNegotiated a $1.5M sale to increase profit margins by 25%\u201d.\n6. Add all relevant skills to your profile. The skills section of a LinkedIn profile can hold up to 50 skills. It is recommended for you to use all 50 of these slots to provide a full look at what you are capable of. This section is very easy to use because it populates suggestions as you are typing and allows you to click on these for a quick listing. For example, while typing \u201cCoaching\u201d it may also populate \u201cBusiness Coaching, Job Coaching and Staff Coaching\u201d.\n\n\n## Add support material\n\n1. Know your audience to target your profile's contents. Given your career path and the type of people you are trying to attract with your LinkedIn profile, you should know what readers will be looking for and you can give the audience what they want. For example, if you are a writer, your audience will be looking for your creativity and to remain engaged throughout your profile by your choice of words and correct grammar. If, however, you are a sales representative, your audience will be looking for your stats and your ability to sell yourself throughout your profile.\n2. Use concise and effective wording to create impact. Just as in a resume, you must keep your sentences concise (brief) and powerful by using effective wording to get your point across. This means using action words such as: drove, reduced, increased, created, initiated, trained, developed, won, and acquired.\n3. Use keywords to enhance your ranking in search results. Using keywords in your profile is extremely important because these keywords will be used by others who are looking to make connections. The more keywords you add that are related to your experience and field of interest, the higher your profile will rank when searched. For example if a recruiter is looking for someone with \u201csales and lead generation\u201d experience they will add these keywords to the search field. To find the best keywords for you to use, browse job openings for various companies and pick out common words and phrases. If you have experience in these areas, use these keywords in your profile. If you have the experience but do not use the keywords, your profile will not appear in the proper search results.\n4. Add relevant presentations, videos and other files to show your expertise. LinkedIn allows you to get creative with your profile. For each job or education listed, you have the option to upload a document or file to further illustrate your experience. Adding these types of files is great for someone who produces work of a visual nature. For example, professional presentations, photographs, videos, ads and graphics. Be sure to add only files that are relevant to your personal experience and accomplishments, and not something about your company or school. For example, do not add a recruiting video about the company you work for.\n5. Ask for recommendations. Having recommendations in your LinkedIn profile is important, because instead of you telling the reader how great you are, they get a chance to hear it from someone else who has worked with you. Once you have made connections with those who you believe will write you a good recommendation, send them a message by clicking on the \u201cAsk to be recommended\u201d link under your profile edit page.\n6. Use special characters. You can use special characters to make your profile stand out by creating bullet points or breaking up a section and creating lines. However, not all symbols are accepted and translated into LinkedIn.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A young professional seeking to enhance their online presence and career opportunities.

{"conversations": ["How to physically flirt with a girl?", "Flirting builds attraction and tension, but it has to be done in the right way. Done in the wrong way, the girl you like might scurry off and never look back. Like all flirting, body language attraction is a fun process, but don\u2019t rush it. Slowly position yourself so that you can flirt with your crush with confidence, and most importantly, have fun with it.\n\n## Get her to warm up to you\n\n1. Get to know her. Think about what she likes and her interests. Ask her if you're not sure. Understanding her interests helps you find common ground so that you have a reason to see and talk to her, which brings you one step closer to physically flirting with her. As you get to know her, be kind and considerate or she might not let you get much closer. Go slow. If you walk up and put your arm around a girl without knowing her well or flirting first, she might get offended and think you\u2019re too forward. Flirting gradually over a period of time -- even if it is a short period of time -- is the best way to get a girl to go out with you.\n2. Compliment her. Compliments give you the ability to let her warm up to you so that you can get close to her physically. When you talk to her, give her a compliment that sounds genuine. Otherwise, she might think you\u2019re trying to \"game\" her. Girls like compliments as long as it doesn\u2019t sound like a pick-up line. Superficial compliments might make her shut down and not want to talk to you. Give compliments that are unique to her and be specific. For instance, compliment her cute ears, freckles or eyes. Remember that a lot of girls -- even the pretty ones -- are very insecure. When you try to compliment her, she might not take you seriously because she thinks you are joking. So, reassure her that you\u2019re not. Don\u2019t neg her or give her a backhanded compliment. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty for a brunette\u201d is not a compliment. Never make her the object of a joke, and if people say something rude -- even if they're teasing -- tell them to stop. Then, quickly glance at her. If her eyes get bigger or if she smiles slightly, then she is impressed and thankful.\n3. Make eye contact when you speak to her. It not only lets her know that you\u2019re listening, but it also gives her the feeling that she is worth your undivided attention. Eye contact creates tension and attraction. Try to hold her gaze for a while without breaking it -- even if there are distractions around. Ignore them. She will be impressed that you didn\u2019t let the chaos around you distract you from her. Then, she\u2019ll be more likely to open up to you.\n4. Mimic her body language. If she leans forward, you lean forward. If she steps to the side, you step to the side. Mimicking her body language is a subtle way of letting her know that you are into her. Even if she is consciously unaware of this, subconsciously she may start to pick up the signal. Watch her body language as well to see if she mimics you. Mimicry is a sign that she is warming up to you even if she is not quite ready for flirtatious touching just yet.\n5. Give her attention in a crowd. Sometimes girls can feel lost when they are standing in a large crowd or even if she is standing amongst friends -- especially if her friends are attractive. She might think that some of her friends get more attention than she does because they are prettier or more outgoing, which means it can be difficult for her to feel like she is being seen and heard. So, make her feel like she is standing out from the others by giving her more attention. When she speaks, pay special attention. Make a point to talk to her directly instead of speaking to others. When the group is making a decision about where to go or what to do, ask her what she thinks the group should do.\n6. Call her just to talk. Make sure that she knows that you really want to get to know her better. Calling her just to chat -- especially since texting is far more popular -- lets her know that you really are interested in getting to know her better. Chat about her interests or current events. Or, just give her a hello and a short chat to let her know you\u2019re thinking about her. You don\u2019t need to be some extreme version of yourself that doesn\u2019t really exist. Just be \u201cnormal.\"\n7. Bring her something. Nothing major. It can be something small like a snack item that you see her eating often. Make sure that you come off like an observant person and not a creepy stalker who likes to watch her. Don't be put off if she refuses your gift. She may not want to immediately accept something from you. She doesn\u2019t want to feel as if she is indebted to you because you gave her something. If you ask a couple of times, she may eventually give in and accept it.\n8. Text her to ask you to meet you somewhere. If she agrees to meet you, don't comment on any other girls or talk about subjects that would make her think you aren't interested-- unless you know she likes those subjects. You don\u2019t want her to think you only like her as a friend. You want to make her feel special, not like just another member of your group\n\n\n## Sneak to touch her\n\n1. Touch her knee against yours. Slowly move your knee toward hers until they touch lightly. Make sure that you touch her knee gently and then linger, so she doesn't think that you are bumping her leg because you need more room for your legs. Flirting by accidental touch helps build attraction because it creates tension. Small touches here and there leaves her wanting more. But remember to keep your eyes open for mutual signals. If it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s enjoying it, stop.\n2. Touch her hand or arm when you laugh. Say something funny, or laugh at her jokes and then laugh. While you\u2019re laughing, gently touch the top of her hand or forearm as if to say \u201c you jokester.\u201d This should look casual and natural. It should look as is if you do this to everyone when you laugh. If you are sitting down when this happens, take this opportunity to casually slide your chair closer to hers.\n3. Tuck her hair behind her ear. This works best if she has a strand of hair out of place or a strand hanging in her face. Gently, tuck the hair behind her ear so that it is out of her face.\n4. Put your hand close to hers. When you are sitting next to her at a table, always place your hand so that it is really close to hers. A finger length apart or a little more is a good distance. To take it a step further, place your hands on hers for just a second as if it is accidental.\n5. Play footsie. If you're sitting at a table/desk across from her, gently put your feet on top of hers. It may seem like playing footsie is a little childish, but it is a way to get a girl\u2019s attention in a playful manner while also letting her know that you\u2019re interested. If she looks under the table and smiles, then she is happy that the person gently kicking her is you.\n\n\n## Flirt with her overtly\n\n1. Hug her. It\u2019s a reason to touch her in a non-sexual way. It\u2019s also a legitimate reason to touch her without seeming too flirty especially if you greet her with a hug. If you do this every time you see her, she will begin to understand that hugging is the way that you greet her.You could possibly get a hug every time you see her. If you want to take it a step further, hug her more frequently. Give her hugs for no reason if you know her fairly well. With time, this may escalate and she might start giving you hugs. However, also keep in mind that some people just don't like hugging. So, it is important to pay attention to her body language and facial expressions. If she doesn't like it, stop; and of course, if she tells you to stop, you should stop immediately.\n2. Play with her hair. Some girls like this. Focus on the hair at the nape of the neck because playing with her hair in this area will probably give her chills -- in a good way. If she is comfortable with you, play with the hair close to her torso or bustline. (Be respectful though.) From there if the girl is still comfortable, take it a little further. With the back of your hand, gently push the hair hanging in front of her shoulders behind her shoulders. (Please don't do this if it looks like the girl worked a long time to style her hair. Even if you are just trying to flirt with her, she will get mad at you for ruining her hair.) If all is well, start to rub her neck like you\u2019re giving her a neck massage.\n3. Put your hands around her waist from behind. If she likes you, she'll most likely lean back on you. Touch her gently so you don't startle her. If you two get really comfortable she might even let you slide your hand down a little lower. Once she\u2019s comfortable with you putting your hands on her waist, grab her and swing her around. Then, she\u2019ll be facing you. Lean in and whisper something in her ear, or just say it outright. You\u2019ll be able to tell if she liked it by the expression on her face. (Beware: Some girls are extremely ticklish and tend to involuntarily squeal or giggle when someone touches their waists).\n4. Push her playfully. When you're walking next to her on a sidewalk or path, gently push her off the path. She'll probably push you back, which will start some playful flirting. Because even childishly pushing each other is a way of flirting. (Don't do this on a busy road though. Someone might get hurt.)\n5. Put your head in her lap. If you're already friends and you're watching a movie, reading, or just talking with friends, go over and lie your head in her lap. Let her play with your hair. If she pushes you off, just laugh. This only works well if you\u2019ve flirted with this girl many times before.\n6. Tickle her. Good areas for tickling are under her ribs or the sides or her stomach. If she likes you, she'll tickle you back -- probably while smiling or laughing. Watch her signals though, if she doesn't like it or if she pulls away, stop.

If she pulls away, revert back to the physical touching that she seems to be comfortable with and do that for a while.\n7. Be respectful.

Overt touching should be consensual, and some people are uncomfortable with public displays of affection or being touched at all. Everyone is different, so it is very important to pay attention to her verbal and non-verbal cues. If she says, \"stop\" at any point, then stop. If she looks uncomfortable, stop.

{"conversations": ["How to handle a dramatic sister in law?", "## Tone down the drama queen\n\n1. Realize that you may be dealing with a drama queen. The dynamics of a sister-in-law (S-I-L) are complex at the best of times but no more so if she has spent much of her life causing her immediate family to run to her beck and call. The drama queen thrives off drama and having everyone pay attention to her as a result. Sit back at your next family occasion and simply watch. Notice how she interacts with her family members, and how they in turn react back. If you witness a lot of step-toeing around her and acquiescing to her, she is clearly used to getting her own way. Consider what happens when she raises a drama-filled topic. Do other family members rush to agree with her about how \"outrageous\" the price of child care/electricity/shampoo/dog grooming/car maintenance/etc. is? Do they confirm her quibbles as quickly as possible, thereby engendering even more complaints? This shows that they enable her complaint-filled view of the world and sadly, have long been used to pandering to it. You can't change them but you can set a new role model by not complaining yourself. Notice what happens when you disagree with her. Does she pout, throw an adult-style tantrum or try and put you down? While it's important to stand your ground on things that matter to you, if she does react childishly, you'll need to learn how to manage this carefully. Learn not so much to disagree as to fail to agree\u2013\u2013there is a fine line but it's about acknowledging her underlying need (notice me, care about me, help me, etc.) without buying into her view of the world.\n2. Do not get involved with the drama. Your S-I-L can let off steam, vent away and curse all she wants but there is no need to join the negativity. Avoid taking any of what is said personally\u2013\u2013the crazier the reactions and actions, the more your S-I-L is grasping at straws to try and provoke you and restore the limelight back onto her. Let her have the limelight in her own home but don't hang around to be vented upon. If it gets really bad, simply announce that you will come back when she is feeling calmer and leave. Equally, if it's happening in your own home, tell it's time to leave. (You can even make up a fake appointment or an early bedtime if you really need a polite excuse.)\n\n\n## Deal with your hot button\n\n1. Look to yourself first. It can be hard when to do this when someone else pushes your buttons. But it is important because it is your reaction that defines whether or not she feels she can keep going in the same direction with you. Some of the things to consider include:\n\t* Stay silent and there's a risk she just thinks you're dumb, awed by her or chewed up with resentment. Take your pick, she's probably happy to think you're feeling all three. And she'll use your silence to keep putting across her point of view at the expense of yours. If you're grinning and bearing it, you're likely turning into a doormat. Argue and she probably thinks her brother/sister has married an angry, resentful and bitter so-and-so who hates her and will do anything to come between her and her brother/sister. You may feel as if you're defending yourself but to her, it's about you not caring what she thinks and possibly even about putting her down. This doesn't mean there isn't room for disagreement; it just means that the manner in which you realign her understanding must be done with care.\n2. Create boundaries. State the facts about matters that she pressures you about, firmly but politely, and avoid being emotional into the bargain. If you state things simply, stick to the facts and avoid making it into an issue about her, she has few places to run. Be aware that she may continue to resent you for speaking your mind in an assertive and self-effective way but this shouldn't stop you from clarifying your position. Ultimately, she has to respect someone who doesn't argue, lose their temper or bite their tongue but instead makes it absolutely clear where the boundaries exist. And even if she doesn't everyone else will plainly see that you are the cooler head in the room. For example, let's say your daughter Sheila has been running outside and has fallen over. Your S-I-L insists that she needs to see a doctor or something terrible might happen. You are quite sure nothing of the sort will occur and you know you're a good parent but S-I-L keeps badgering you, upping the intensity of all the bad things that will happen if you fail to follow her advice. Offer your S-I-L a calmly spoken \"That's very kind of you to notice that Sheila has a bruised knee but I am thoroughly satisfied that Sheila is going to be all right; this happens all the time and is a part of the way she learns to cope with the great outdoors. She does not need to see the doctor.\" And that's the end of it, no need to enter into any further discussion. If S-I-L keeps trying, smile and change the subject; refuse to re-engage on the matter.\n\n\n## You and your spouse\n\n1. Talk to your spouse about your feelings. Avoid name-calling, insulting or insinuating anything about your sister-in-law. Instead, explain how you feel when the proverbial dung hits the fan whenever you're in her presence. Your spouse cannot fault your feelings, so be clear and thoughtful in stating them. This puts your spouse on notice that you've recognized the behavior of your S-I-L for what it is and that you have chosen to no longer accept being at the receiving end of it. For example, \"Georgia, when your sister talks a lot about how hard it is to fund her children's private schooling, I feel claustrophobic because she doesn't know when to stop discussing it. Given that we can barely afford our mortgage, I feel a little distressed at this kind of talk all night. I'd like to stop putting myself in this position from now on by simply acknowledging her problem but not letting her continue discussing it all night and I'd like you to help me do this by finding other subjects to talk about that don't involve money. Do you think that this is something you can get on board with? \".\n2. Ask your spouse to think carefully about the way in which he or she relays information about family issues. Tell your spouse that you love to hear about how your sister-in-law is doing but that you don't appreciate hearing about the embellished drama that often comes with it. Help your spouse to recognize what you consider to be \"drama\" from what you consider to be \"real news\" and in time, both of you will learn to speak about family matters in a less dramatic and more emotionally healthy way. Remind your spouse gently whenever you feel that your S-I-L's drama is being repeated in your house. You could even have a special signal rather than having to spell it out each time. Place a ban on gossip at home (or anywhere). Remind one another whenever it veers anywhere near close to gossip and shut it down. It doesn't matter if you feel you are being gossiped about; you're the bigger person for not engaging in the same behavior.\n\n\n## Cop with your s-i-l's call and message\n\n1. Avoid answering what isn't worthy of a response. Don't respond to any text messages that do not directly relate to a family get-together, positive messages or something else perfectly normal. If you are getting texts that spell out her outrage about things that have happened to her, her annoyance at something you've apparently done or to send you gossip about family or friends, let it slide and leave her wondering. If you feel angry and want to send back a retort, reprimand or justification straight away, don't do it. Treat your anger or irritation as a warning sign to sleep on the matter. Furious texting or messaging can only end in more angst on both sides.\n2. Keep social media networking to a minimum with your sister-in-law if she sets off your buttons. If your S-I-L is truly a pain and a bit of a drama queen, it's possible that her social networking reflects her attention-seeking ways. You can be all too easily drawn into a web of her anger and drama venting if you can see her Facebook updates or her latest tweets. If she friends you, you can do one of several things. One, simply ignore the request. When she asks you about it, tell her that you don't use social media much to exchange important things (or at all); or\n\t* Two, reply to her with a \"Thanks but no thanks, I am not accepting new requests at the moment due to busyness/privacy/overloading, etc.\" You might also add something like, \"Besides, we see each other often and I prefer we talk face-to-face\"; or\n\t* Three, turn all of your settings to private so that she can't see who you are friends with. Either say nothing or tell her either that you stopped using social media or that you only have a tight knit circle of followers and don't wish to extend it at the moment. If you say you didn't receive any request, she'll only resend it, but it might buy enough time to throw her off the whole idea if you offer to \"look into it\" but let the \"looking into it\" drag on and refuse to raise the matter again); or\n\t* Four, offer her a more neutral alternative. Offer to friend her on Pinterest and focus solely on a shared craft or cooking board. Nothing racy or mean spirited, of course. Try to avoid using the terminology of \"friends\" when discussing any refusal to accept her request. Unfortunately, the usage of this term by social media sites has caused many people to take it at face value; many people are simply followers or fans, not friends. She might feel devalued if you make any suggestion that she is being rejected as a \"friend\". If she is already a follower of one or more of your networking sites, you might consider blocking her and turning your pages private on some sites. Most probably you will need to explain what has happened (with a sound excuse); if she's a drama queen, she'll not only notice but she'll take offense too.\n3. Take care if you do soldier on and try to be her friend online and/or through the phone. If she acts abusively, it is recommended that you keep records to show your spouse and other family members if needed. Save messages, emails, voice-mails, etc. Some drama queens like to \"attack\" when nobody else can see, thinking you won't have the courage to out them. This isn't about deliberately looking for dirt but it is a way of protecting yourself if anything should get out of hand. However, this is truly the stuff of last resort\u2013\u2013if you handle yourself deftly in public situations around your S-I-L, everyone will know for real who is behaving and who is stirring the pot.\n\n\n## A kinder future together\n\n1. Get on with your lives together. You married your spouse, not your family. While his or her family members are part of the package, they are not a part of your intimacy and they do not share the same journey with the two of you. If you make it very obvious that you're not bothered by jealousy, insinuations, rumors or gossip, it will soon become clear to your S-I-L that her barbs, attitude and meanness aren't pricking you in the way that they used to. Eventually, it ceases to be profitable or enjoyable for her to keep bothering and most likely she'll begrudgingly go and find someone else to taunt and hassle. Spend less time around your S-I-L. In what ways are you putting yourself in her pathway? While it may feel like you have to put up with her, you can find ways to reduce the time spent together. For example, ask other family members to meet you at different times than when she is around, more often than not. Don't always do this, or she will have a legitimate cause for complaining, but time spent with other family members shouldn't always involve her presence. If you live far away and have to visit once a year, stay in your own accommodation to give yourself respite. Take walks, get outside and don't overstay any welcome when it comes to drawn-out family events that press your buttons. Families know the pressure points better than anyone and unfortunately, some like to press them. At such events, your S-I-L probably has alliances that she can set in train to be even more effective, so the less time spent near such complaint-prone cliques, the better.\n2. Listen for real. When you are around your S-I-L, try active listening and acknowledgment in place of letting your fog of self-defensiveness take control. When she gets on top of her complaining mountain, instead of trying to topple her off with \"if you think that's bad, you should live in my shoes\" replies, actually focus on her and try to discern what is really driving her jibes, whining and gossip. By not making this about you, you may be truly surprised at what you unearth.As for responding to her, acknowledge her pain with neutral comments like: \"I'm sorry you have had to go through that to pay an electricity bill. It must be hard having four kids chewing through the power each month.\" Don't offer advice, don't offer how you would deal with it and don't ever offer to pay or pave the way to see her problem resolved. She owns it, you simply acknowledge it.\n3. Be compassionate. If your S-I-L has been a pain more than once and has even done things to show you up or drag you down, the chances are that she will try to do it again, even when you don't bite. But if you're ready for it and if you're understanding as to where she is coming from (insecurity, loneliness, feeling left out, needing to be in control, etc. ), you can be compassionate about her actions and detach yourself from her drama. If you don't carry her load, she'll be forced to do it for herself and will stop seeing you as a viable target.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned family member or close friend who is seeking advice on managing a challenging relationship with a family member, specifically a sister-in-law, who tends to be emotional and unpredictable.

{"conversations": ["How to do a simple number mind trick?", "Amaze your friends and relatives with these number-based mind tricks. These three tricks are arranged from easiest to hardest (smallest numbers to biggest). Even young kids can do the simple number prediction trick.\n\n## Simple number prediction\n\n1. Set the trick up. Tell a friend that you are performing a math trick. You will ask her to do some calculations secretly, then read her mind for their answer.\n2. Write down your prediction. Pretend to think hard for a moment, then write down the number 3 on a piece of paper. Fold the paper in half, without letting anyone see the number.\n3. Ask your friend to write down a number between 1 and 20. She should pick this secretly and keep the piece of paper. We'll go through an example, where your friend secretly picks the number 4. This trick works with any number, but keeping it between 1 and 20 makes it less likely that your friend will make a mistake.\n4. Instruct her to add 1 to her number. Warn her not to give you any sign, not even moving her lips. All you need is your mental powers. For example, if she chose 4, her new number is 4 + 1 = 5.\n5. Tell your friend to double the new number. Have her take the last number she had, and multiply it by 2. 5 x 2 = 10.\n6. Have her add 4 more. Put your hands to your head and concentrate, then tell her to add 4 to her last answer. 10 + 4 = 14.\n7. Divide by 2. Tell her you almost have it, but the number is too big for you to see. Ask her to divide it by 2 to make it easier. 14 \u00f7 2 = 7.\n8. Subtract the original number. Ask your friend to look at the piece of paper she used to remind herself what the original number was. Take the last answer she had and subtract that original number. 7 - 4 = 3.\n9. Show her your prediction. Tell her you've finally read her mind. Ask her to announce the last number she ended up with. Once she has, unfold your piece of paper and reveal the 3 you wrote down. No matter which number she started with, her answer will be 3.\n\n\n## Guess someone's age\n\n1. Tell someone you're going to find his age. Let him know you'll be using your mathematical mind-reading abilities. Give him a calculator if he doesn't want to do the calculations in his head. This trick won't be too impressive with close friends or classmates, since you probably already know their age. Pick someone at least 10 years old and no more than 99 years old.\n2. Ask him to multiply the first digit in his age by five. Remind him to do the math silently, to keep his age secret from you. For example, if he is 32 years old, he should take the 3 and multiply it by 5. The answer is 3 x 5 = 15.\n3. Add 4 to his answer. Tell him to add 4 to the answer he found. In our example, he would silently add 15 + 4 = 19.\n4. Tell him to double his answer. Now your subject should multiply his last answer by 2, and let you know when he's finished. If he's doing the math in his head, ask him \"Are you sure?\" since people are most likely to make a mistake on this step. 19 x 2 = 38.\n5. Have him add the second digit of his age. Next, the person you're \"mind reading\" adds the last number in his age. Tell him this is the last calculation he needs to do. Since the subject of our example is 32 years old, he would add 2 to his last answer. His last answer was 38, so he calculates 38 + 2 = 40.\n6. Ask for his last answer. Have him say the final number out loud, so you and everyone in the room can hear it.\n7. Subtract 8 and tell him his real age. Silently subtract 8 from the number he gave you. The answer is his age, which you should announce to the room. In our example, 40 - 8 = 32.\n8. Try some variations. If you perform this trick more than once, people might figure out how it works. Here are a couple variations to keep it mysterious:\n\t* Instead of adding 4 and later (secretly) subtracting 8, you can add 3 and subtract 6, or add 2 and subtract 4, or even add 25 and subtract 50. Just remember you'll need to subtract twice as much as the original number, because it got doubled in one of the later steps. To really switch it up, try this: double your age, add 2, multiply by 5, and subtract 10. You need both the doubling and multiplication by five to move the first digit of his age (3 in our example) to the tens place where it belongs (3 x 2 x 5 = 30).\n\n\n## Magical 37\n\n1. Hand a volunteer a pencil and paper. This one involves some three digit numbers, so most people will not want to do the math in their head. Warn the volunteer that he will need to do long division.\n2. Ask him to write the same digit 3 times. Tell him to hide the paper from you to prove you're not cheating. Ask him to write a 3-digit number that repeats the same digit three times. For example, he could write 222.\n3. Instruct him to add each digit together. Now your volunteer should treat each of the three digits as a separate number, and find their sum. For example, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n4. Tell him to divide the larger number by the smaller one. He should now take the 3-digit number, and divide it by the\\ smaller one. Give him some time to work this out. 222 / 6 = 37,\n5. Announce that his number is 37. As long as your volunteer followed the instructions correctly, his answer will always be 37.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A curious and creative individual who enjoys mental challenges and is interested in learning new cognitive skills.

All you need is a sturdy rubber band a little bit of patience. Once you get a single star down, try making a star within a star to up the ante a bit.\n\n## Create a single star\n\n1. Place a sturdy rubber band over your left thumb and index finger. Put the rubber band near the end of your fingers and stretch your fingers out slightly so the rubber band stays taut. Turn your hand so that your palm is facing you. Choose a rubber band that's not too wide, as wide rubber bands are more difficult to stretch. Also, pick a slightly longer rubber band than normal. There's not a set width and length, but if you're having trouble stretching it around your fingers, it probably won't work.\n2. Lift the band closest to you over the top band and pull the top band out. When holding your palm toward you, you'll see 2 bands. Push your right index finger underneath the first one and hook your finger over the second band, pulling it out. It should go underneath the first band and out toward your palm.\n3. Twist the loop over itself and hook it on your pinkie. Use your right hand to twist the band you just pulled out to the right over itself. It should make a little teardrop-shaped loop that you can hook over your pinkie. You should now have a triangle shape stretched between your index finger, thumb, and pinkie. The rubber band should twist around each finger to make a teardrop-shaped loop, and the triangle should be on the inside edges of your fingers, not the outside.\n4. Reach into your thumb loop to grab the top band with your index finger. Insert your right index finger near the inside of your left thumb in the loop made by the rubber band, going down as you do. Go up through the middle triangle (with the thumb loop over your finger) to grab the band that's between your left index finger and your pinkie. Draw the band out the way you came in, through the thumb loop. You should now have a square in the middle. Keep holding on to the loop you pulled out with your right index finger.\n5. Grab the right side of the band between your 2 index fingers. Insert your right middle finger up through the loop that's over your pinkie. Grab the band that's just to the left and pull it out below. Stretch out your fingers to make the final star! Your right index finger and right middle finger will be holding on to 2 points of the star.\n\n\n## Move to a double star\n\n1. Begin with a single star. To move to a double star, you need to be able to make the single star first. The double star is a continuation of the single star, so get your hands in position with your left index finger, left thumb, left pinkie, right index finger, and right middle finger each holding a point of the star. You will need a long rubber band that's not too wide. You should easily be able to stretch it between 2 hands. However, it should be small enough to maintain tension over 3 fingers on one hand.\n2. Release your pinkie and your left thumb and stretch the triangle over them. Let the loops just pop over the edges of these fingers. As you do, you'll have a triangle shape with a loop over the right index finger and a loop over the middle index finger. Place the right index finger loop over your left thumb and the right middle finger loop over the left pinkie. Pull your right fingers out of the loops.\n3. Grab the bottom of the loop near your index finger. Use your right index finger and middle finger and grab the band the runs directly in front of your left index finger. It's technically the bottom part of the loop going over the index finger. Insert your fingers in it from the top but with your finger pads pointing up.\n4. Pull the bottom loop down and twist it. The loop should end up below the other parts of the rubber band. Twist it over itself to the left, forming a new loop. The loop should currently be over your right index finger and middle finger.\n5. Place your right fingers through the bottom loops. Put your right index finger through the inside of the loop that goes over your thumb. Place your right middle finger through the inside of the loop that goes over your pinkie, going from the top each time.\n6. Lift the loop off with your thumb. Grab the loop that you pulled down from the top with your right thumb and pull it over the ends of your fingers while keeping them in the loops of the star. Pull down on the 2 loops at the bottom, and you have a star within a star!\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A curious and creative individual, possibly a parent or an educator, who is seeking fun and educational activities for children.

{"conversations": ["How to be a lazy college student?", "In college, unlike in high school, you are expected to take responsibility for your own learning.  It is ultimately up to you to determine how much time and effort you want to put into your schoolwork. Experts suggest that college students today work considerably fewer hours than their counterparts did in 1961.  But there is also evidence that working more hours is not necessarily the best way to be productive. A little laziness may even be good for us.\n\n## Part 1 of 3: prioritize what's important\n\n1. Ask yourself what you want from college. There are many reasons why a college degree is desirable, not least that it is still considered highly valuable by many employers. Your own reasons for pursuing a college degree may be more personal, but spend some time working out exactly what these reasons are. Consider why college is important to you. Do you want to learn important skills like critical thinking and problem-solving? Do you want to make friends, network and get to know other people? Do you want to get good grades for further study? Do you want to get a particular job that requires a college degree? Spend some time reflecting on these questions and come up with your own answers. It might even be a good idea to write them down. This will help you to recognize what's important to you so that you can focus on the essential things.\n2. Select your major and your classes carefully. After you have determined what's important to you as a college student, then you can make better decisions about pursuing a major or particular class that will help you achieve your goals. Speak to your academic advisor. It is their job to provide information about what certain majors entail and what courses are necessary. Ask other students for information about the class. Ask questions like, is the course time-consuming? Is the professor fair? What are the assignments like? If you don't know any other students, look online. There are many websites, some more general and others specific to particular schools where students share this kind of information. Be aware that what is on these sites are merely individual opinions, and your own experience of the course may be different.\n3. Complete as much coursework as you can before the semester gets going. Preparation is key and doing what you can before the semester starts will help things run more smoothly later on. For example, ask the professor for a copy of the syllabus ahead of time so that you can order the necessary materials before the semester starts. Familiarize yourself with the course materials. You can even start reading early to get ahead!\n4. Figure out what is actually required to do well in the class. This is key to being a lazy, yet productive, college student. Professors often cut material from the syllabus as the class goes on. Usually, the syllabus contains more material than it is possible to get through in a single semester. Ask your professor what is required reading and what materials or course readings may be more supplementary, i.e. they will not appear on exams or in assignments. Pay attention to what kinds of materials come up most frequently in lectures. For example, there may be a textbook chapter and several articles assigned for each class, yet the professor usually focuses on the textbook chapters in lecture. If you can determine a pattern then you can use this in your own preparation for the class.\n5. Streamline your commitments. Being a college student is not simply about going to class, many students are also part of sports teams, fraternities/ sororities, student associations and take on other voluntary roles. These are obviously important and worthwhile activities, but ask yourself if there are any commitments you could scale back on. Identify particular commitments that are not necessary to the goals that you have chosen to focus on. Accept that you can't do everything.\n\n\n## Part 2 of 3: make the most of your time\n\n1. Get things done at the right time. Timing is essential to being a lazy college student. While procrastination can be appealing, there are some activities that are best done at certain times. Here are some examples. Do your homework straight after class when the content is fresh in your mind. This will save you time as you won't have to re-visit the material at a later date when you might have forgotten it. Write out an essay plan or outline immediately after discussing it with the teaching assistant or professor in office hours. Again, if you spend some time getting your ideas on paper at the right moment then you'll save yourself time in the future because you won't have to worry about all the good ideas you might have forgotten.\n2. Take good notes. At some point, you will have to engage with the course materials. If you take good notes the first time around, then at the end of the semester or when an assignment is due you can use these notes and avoid having to re-visit what you have already read. Write good summaries. Try to distill the argument of a text or the main points in a chapter into a single paragraph. This will serve you well when you come back to look at your notes. Figure out if typing notes works best for you or if you prefer to write them long-hand. Annotate and highlight the text. Use sticky notes to mark important parts.\n3. Learn how to read quickly. Most college courses require you to read a high volume of complex material. Learning to read quickly and effectively is one of the key skills you learn in college. Preview the passage before you start reading it. Take a minute or two to look at the title, the headings or subheadings, any pictures, charts or graphs. Skim over the passage by reading the first and last paragraph, and the first sentence of every paragraph. Researchers suggest that these techniques improves reading comprehension, which will ultimately save you time as you already begin reading with a sense of what's important in the passage. Read in the right environment so that you actually take in what you are reading. This will prevent wasting time by re-reading certain parts that you missed. This requires good lighting, a comfortable upright reading position, minimal distraction and regular breaks.\n4. Utilize \"dead\" time. This refers to the hours in the day spent in routine, non-productive tasks. The idea is that focusing on these key moments can actually give you more free time to relax and be lazy. For example, those 30 minutes spent staring out the bus window during your daily commute could be utilized for productive tasks like reading over your notes or listening to the lecture that you recorded. If you have free time in between classes, go to the library or the nearest cafe and spend the time studying.\n\n\n## Part 3 of 3: learn other ways to work efficiently\n\n1. Take advantage of college resources. Colleges often provide writing centers and tutoring services to their students. It is a good idea to make use of these services as they will help you get the work done faster and prevent you wasting time being stuck on a particular problem or difficult assignment.\n2. Form a study group. Collaborating with other students in study groups can be an excellent way to share the workload. When prepping for the final exam, delegate different topics to different members of the study group to make notes on. This can be a great time saver, although you will obviously still need to make sure that you are familiar with all the course content. Make sure everyone in the study group is on the same page and shares the work equally.\n3. Seek help from your professor. Remember there is no shame in getting help when you need it. Most professors and teaching assistants have weekly office hours. They can help you strategize for success in the class. Get advice on assignments and exam preparation, often this will prevent you wasting time on what isn't essential to the course.\n4. Get the right technology. There is lots of technology that can help you as a college student, a laptop being the most obvious investment. Consider investing in a recording device. This can prove useful especially if you have difficulty concentrating in lecture or are going to miss a key class. Always remember to ask the professor for permission before you record them! Use software to help with referencing and citations. Many college papers, especially research papers, require correctly formatted references and bibliographies. There are many programs available to help with this, which will ultimately save you time and avoid any issues with incorrect citations.\n5. Work on managing stress. College can be stressful, for many students it is the first time living away from home and there are increasing financial pressures on students, many of whom work to sustain themselves throughout college. Acknowledge that stress is normal, but be aware that too much time spent worrying or stressing can be unhealthy and stop you from succeeding. Engage with your college's resources for managing stress. Many colleges provide programming for students to help with stress management, especially during finals period. Some key ways to manage stress are to engage in physical exercise, make time for relaxing activities, and try to get enough sleep. When it comes to managing stress, being lazy sometimes can be a good thing!\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A college student who is struggling to manage their time effectively and is seeking unconventional advice to improve their productivity without putting in much effort.

{"conversations": ["How to set up an aquarium?", "Setting up an aquarium can be quite difficult that involves a lot of patience, maintenance, and testing before you can even add any tank inhabitants. Despite this, setting up your aquarium correctly is vital for your pets' health and longevity. There are different ways to set up different types of aquariums.\n\n## Choose an aquarium type\n\n1. Decide if you want a freshwater aquarium or saltwater aquarium. There are many differences between having a freshwater aquarium versus having a saltwater aquarium. These differences include how you initially set up the aquarium and all ongoing care, maintenance, everyday chores, and costs requirements. There are several key issues you will need to consider while you choose:\n2. Think about the size of tank you\u2019d like. A small fish tank set up is generally more economical than a large fish tank. There are several issues you should consider when choosing the size of your tank:\n3. Choose what type of saltwater aquarium you\u2019d like to set up. There are three main saltwater aquarium types: Fish Only, Fish Only with Live Rock (FOWLR), and the Reef Tank. Fish Only Tanks: As the name suggests, this tank only houses saltwater fish. It is the least expensive way to set up a saltwater aquarium. However, it does have its disadvantages. Fish Only tanks take longer to set up, require more frequent tank maintenance and testing, and have a shorter shelf life than the other types of saltwater aquariums. Fish Only with Live Rock: FOWLR tanks are set up like Fish Only tanks but with the addition of live rock and better aquarium lighting. The live rock acts as a natural biological filter for saltwater and keeps your tank healthier than a Fish Only tank. A live rock has hundreds of tiny creatures and biological organisms living inside and on the surface of the rock. Reef Tank: If you choose this type of saltwater aquarium, you are most likely looking towards having invertebrates, corals, or anemones as the main focus of your aquarium and fish are just an afterthought. Reef tanks require daily water quality checks, high lighting levels, extra water supplements, heavy duty filtration systems and are generally the most expensive to maintain. Reef Tanks are recommended for more experienced aquarium hobbyists.\n4. Determine what the correct lighting and heating for your fish is. The kind of lighting and the temperature of your aquarium depend on what kind of aquarium you have and who your tank inhabitants are. The type of light you choose also affects the overall temperature of your tank. Aquariums that are Fish Only: This means your freshwater tank will not have real or live plants in it. In this case, you will most likely be using fluorescent lights that are between 18 and 40 watts. Freshwater aquariums with plants: The type of lighting you\u2019ll need will depend on the depth of your tank, the plant species you have, and the desired growth rate of the plant. Usually, you should provide 2 to 5 watts of light per gallon in a planted freshwater aquarium. Always research and consult with your aquarium expert when you plan to have plants in your tank. Saltwater Reef Tanks: These tanks need high levels of light that are characteristic of high output fluorescent and metal halide lamps. Some corals may even need more intense levels of light that can be achieved with T5-HO, Very High Output (VHO), and metal halide lights.\n5. Choose the appropriate type of filter or filters for your tank. All filters have three functions to them, which include mechanically filtering the water by trapping or removing free floating particles, biologically filtering the water by growing good bacteria, and chemically filtering the water by dissolving wastes. There are various types of filter:\n\n\n## Set up a freshwater aquarium\n\n1. Gather all the equipment needed for your aquarium. Before buying your fish, you need to prepare the aquarium. A typical freshwater aquarium needs:\n2. Clean your tank, gravel, decorations, and filters. Never use soap or detergents to clean your tank. Using soaps or detergents can seriously injure and damage your tank inhabitants. Simply wash your tank and equipment with hot water. Use a sponge or clean washcloth and scrub the inside of your tank. Then hose it down to rid your tank of any impurities. Wash and soak your aquarium gravel or sand in a bucket. Use a pasta strainer to separate the dirtied water from the gravel. Wash and massage your filter\u2019s cartridges under the tap or in a bucket. This is very important, especially if you\u2019re using a carbon filter. Massaging or rubbing the filter activates the carbon inside the cartridge. Wash all decorations in clean water.\n3. Set up your aquarium. This means putting your tank on its stand, filling the tank with gravel, arranging your decorations and airstones, and setting up the lighting and heating for your aquarium. If you are using an undergravel filter, place the bottom plates into your tank and attach all necessary tubes, airline, gang valves, and air pumps before adding your gravel. Don\u2019t plug in your filter. Set it up and place it in the correct position but don\u2019t turn it on until you have water in the tank. Having it on without water can damage your filter.\n4. Add water to your freshwater aquarium. It\u2019s vital you treat your water with conditioner to remove chlorine and chloramine. You can find water conditioners at your local pet store with instructions on how much to add depending on how big of a tank you have. Don\u2019t fill the tank with water until you are sure of your aquarium\u2019s layout. It can get quite messy if you stick your hand in a full tank to move things around. Place a plate over your gravel to avoid messing up your tank layout. Pour water directly onto the plate so the pressure of a stream of water won\u2019t make a hole in your gravel or move your decorations around. Remove the place once your tank is full.\n5. Turn on your aquarium\u2019s filter, lights, and heater. This will begin your tank\u2019s nitrogen cycle. Ensure your tank is safe electrically before turning or plugging everything in. A power cord in the wrong place can cause serious injury to you.\n6. Wait a few days before adding fish to your tank. The nitrogen cycle takes a few days for it to completely stabilize. You might notice your tank becoming cloudy which means the cycle is kicking in. You can add some hardy fish like feeder goldfish to your tank to speed up the nitrogen cycle. However, don\u2019t expect the fish to survive, as the harsh conditions of a new aquarium can be quite stressful and inhospitable. Use a nitrate testing kit to ensure your aquarium is at its best quality before adding your fish.\n\n\n## Set up a saltwater aquarium\n\n1. Gather all the equipment needed for your aquarium. Before buying your fish, you need to prepare the aquarium. A typical saltwater aquarium needs:\n2. Clean your tank, decorations, and filters. Never use soap or detergents to clean your tank. Using soaps or detergents can seriously injure and damage your tank inhabitants. Simply wash your tank and equipment with hot water. Use a sponge or clean washcloth and scrub the inside of your tank. Then hose it down to rid your tank of any impurities. Wash and massage your filter\u2019s cartridges under the tap or in a bucket. This is very important, especially if you\u2019re using a carbon filter. Massaging or rubbing the filter activates the carbon inside the cartridge. Wash all decorations in clean water. Your substrate will be cleaned after your aquarium is set up.\n3. Set up your aquarium. This means putting your tank on its stand, arranging your power heads, and setting up the lighting and heating for your aquarium. If you are adding a live rock, do not add substrate or decorations to your tank. You must cure your live rock before you can do this. Don\u2019t plug in your filter. Set it up and place it in the correct position but don\u2019t turn it on until you have water in the tank. Having it on without water can damage your filter.\n4. Add saltwater to your aquarium. The saltwater mix you purchased should have detailed instructions on how to prepare your saltwater. Generally, you will be mixing room temperature water with the salt mix in a bucket or several buckets. If you don\u2019t have enough buckets, you will need to prepare your water in parts or mix the salt right in the tank. Check your salt levels with your refractometer. Typically, the specific gravity reading should be between 1.021 and 1.024 depending on the temperature of your water. Measuring the specific gravity of your saltwater means measuring the density of your water since adding salt to water increases the density of water.\n5. Cure your live rock. If you have FOWLR tank, you will need to start the process of curing your live rock, which could take up to 2 months to complete. To begin the process:\n6. Prepare your substrate before adding it to your tank. Before adding any substrate to your tank, you will need to prepare a bucket of saltwater to help clean it. Add your substrate into the bucket and stir. This allows the dust and dirt from your substrate to rise for you to siphon out with your aquarium vacuum.

Cut small squares out and be sure to make each piece the same size. Since this is a memory game, it is important that each card looks the same so you are unable to differentiate one card from the next.\n2. Write out information on game pieces. Work in pairs when writing out your review information on these cards. Write down a vocabulary word on the first card in the pair and its definition on the second. Continue writing on your cards until each review item has been covered. This game words best when reviewing things like definitions, spelling, examples, etc.\n3. Organize your cards. Flip over all your cards so that the writing is underneath. Place your cards face down and organize them into rows and columns until every game piece is situated.\n4. Flip over one card. Begin the game by choosing just one card to turn over. Read the definition or vocabulary word and choose one more card to turn over. If you flipped over the correct card, you should have a pair in which both cards are a match. When first starting out, this game is sheer luck, but after a few tries you will be able to remember where each card lies and can do your best to find its correct match.\n5. Set aside pairs. When you have found two cards that are a match, set that pair aside so that your game board becomes smaller. Continue playing until every card has been turned over and you have created matches for each game piece. When you are finished playing, you can simply shuffle your cards and redistribute them to create your game board and play again.\n\n\n## Play with card\n\n1. Obtain a deck of cards. The first thing you need to do is get an entire deck of cards. Be sure you aren\u2019t missing any because it will affect how you play the game.\n2. Create a list of review items. Using your study materials, create a list of items you want to review. This list must be numbered and can be anything from definitions to vocabulary.\n3. Pull out face cards from your deck. You want to eliminate any face cards from your deck because the only cards needed are those with numbers. You may set the face cards aside until you have finished playing. An alternative to pulling out face cards is using them to play the game. Treat these cards like wild cards and whenever you draw one you can choose to review any item from your list that you wish to review.\n4. Shuffle your cards. It is very important to shuffle your deck. By doing this, you will ensure that each review item gets chosen by mixing up the numbers within the deck.\n5. Draw cards. Place your cards in a pile after shuffling them and draw the first card off the top. You may set aside all the cards you have already drawn.\n6. Review information corresponding to the number on each card. Look at the number on the card you drew and find the corresponding number on your list of review items. Review the information for that particular number. Continue to draw cards and review the information corresponding to those cards until you have gone through the entire deck.\n\n\n## Play a guess game\n\n1. Create a list of questions. Before generating a list of game questions, you must first go through all of your study materials and review critical information. While reviewing, form questions and produce a list.\n2. Cut small pieces of paper. Once your list is created you are ready to craft several pieces of small paper. These pieces of paper will serve as the main game pieces. Use card stock or heavy-duty paper for sturdy game pieces. Use sticky notes as another option to quickly create piece.\n3. Number papers. You created your main game pieces so now you must number them according to how many questions you developed.\n4. Put papers in container. Place all of your numbered game pieces into the container and be careful not to forget any. Be sure to shake the container once you\u2019ve put all your game pieces inside to ensure the pieces are mixed sufficiently.\n5. Draw paper from container. Keep your list of questions next to you as you pull pieces out of the container. Choose randomly from the container and read the number on the piece of paper.\n6. Answer corresponding questions. Find the number on your question list that corresponds to the number on your game piece and read that question.\n7. Set aside used pieces. After answering each question, put the used game pieces aside so as not to repeat any. If you are unable to recall the correct answers to any questions you can make two piles designating one for challenging questions and one for easy questions. When you play the game for again, you can just put the challenging questions inside the container and spend less time reviewing the questions you already know.\n8. Repeat steps until container is empty. Continue draw the papers from the container until you\u2019ve used them all.

{"conversations": ["How to walk a slackline?", "## The basics\n\n1. Start with a short slackline. The shorter the distance between the two anchor points, the more stable the slackline. As the slackline gets longer, a few things happen:\n\t* The tension in the line increases, making dismounts more dangerous due to the extra force;\n\t* The height of the line off the ground increases to allow for greater sag when weighted;\n\t* It requires more force to tighten it, which can be difficult with some tightening systems.\n2. Place one foot lengthwise in the middle of the slackline. Starting barefoot is a good idea. Using bare feet will allow you to feel the line better and find your balance more quickly. Step on the line so that it runs from between your big toe and second toe back to the middle of the heel. As you improve, practice turning your feet and standing sideways, with your shoulders parallel to the line. Once you improve (or if the landing is not safe for bare feet), you may want to switch to shoes since they provide greater protection when attempting tricks and landing.\n3. You can mount the slackline at any point, but starting in the middle is generally safer, since it is usually away from obstacles you might hit when falling. The line is also lower to the ground in the middle once weighted, reducing the height of the falls. Practice from the same place each time since the slackline oscillates differently at different distances from the anchors. The wobbles are faster and smaller near the anchors and slower and larger near the middle. But wherever you start, it is going to wobble a lot. This is natural; everyone wobbles the first time.\n4. Take a couple deep breaths and settle yourself. If you are relaxed, your foot will be less shaky on the line.\n5. Focus intently on a single point, such as the anchor. This will help you find and keep your balance. Resist the temptation to look straight down at your feet on the line. Looking down at the wobbling line will simply make you wobble as well. Look ahead instead of down at the line.\n6. Put your arms out wide, slightly bent and keep an upright posture.\n7. Center your weight directly over the foot on the line. With one smooth, balanced motion stand up on that leg.\n8. Balance on one foot, while using your arms and other leg to help maintain your balance.\n9. Bend the leg that is on the slackline. Bending your leg lowers your center of gravity slightly, and allows you to more easily find your balance and absorb the movements of the line.\n10. Continue to wave your free arms and legs around to help you balance. Sometimes you will twist and turn your body into all sorts of positions to keep your balance. Once you have caught your balance slowly move your body back to center with your arms up and out, knee(s) bent, head up, and eyes focused on a single point.\n11. Repeat these steps until you can balance for at least 15 seconds.\n12. Practice with the other foot. Once you can keep your balance, attempt taking a step.\n13. Once you've successfully taken your first step, keep practicing!\n\n\n## Sample skill progression for beginners\n\n1. These are small steps you can take to improve your slack lining effectively, by slowly taking on harder and harder tasks. Mount the line on one foot with a friend sitting on the line. Increase the distance between you and the person sitting on the line. Balance on one foot by yourself. Balance on the other foot. Balance with both feet, one behind the other, on the line. Take small steps forward. Take small steps backwards. Mount the line sideways (shoulders parallel to the line) with both feet, one at a time. Turn on the line.\n2. Additionally, learn how to fall safely. As a beginner you will likely be on a short, low-to-the-ground slackline. Most of the time you can land on your feet. As you try new tricks, the slackline can \"throw\" you as you lose your balance. The best solution is to use the \"throw\" of the slackline to help you get away from the line and land on your feet. If you are thrown off-balance from the line consider rolling through the fall to limit the impact.\n3. You can also try starting with \"training wheels.\" One way to do so is to have a friend sit on the line a few feet away from you. This takes much of the sway and bounce out of the line. As you get better, have your friend move further away on the line to allow for more wobble. When starting out, you can aid each other while learning to balance--have a spotter stand/walk next to the line. If you practice walking back and forth with a shoulder to lean on, you\u2019ll soon find that you don\u2019t need training wheels any more!\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An individual with an interest in extreme sports, adventure, or balance activities.

{"conversations": ["Why is digital photography so expensive?", "Digital photography is not expensive but buying into it is.\n\nWith film photography camera and lenses were a moderate investment but these lasted quite long. Even a battery in a film camera would last several years. Cameras and lenses were mechanical and much simpler than today's models. This made them require less expertise to manufacture and also made them incredibly sturdy. A lifespan of a decade for a camera and several decades for lenses was not uncommon.\n\nHowever, the real cost of film photography is film and development. Each roll of film costs several dollars and gives up to 36 images. Specialized rolls were more expensive and had fewer exposures. Then, if you did not do development yourself, you had to pay for development. Also prints. Even if you did your own, chemicals and papers were recurring costs. And there was the added expensive of creating a wet darkroom. In the end, the hobby was quite costly.\n\nWith digital photography, you pay nearly all costs up-front and it comes out much cheaper for anyone who is into the art and shoots regularly. A mid-range DSLR with good lens and memory can easily be obtained for less than $2500. Many entry level ones exist for under $1000. If you were to shoot 10,000 frames before both your camera and lens dies, it would cost you between 2.5&cent; to 10&cent; per frame. It is far far less than even just the film for each frame. Still most cameras have shutters rated to at least 100,000 frames and lenses last much longer than cameras. Even if you only captured 1000 images, you would have a better deal than with film photography. All digital cameras come with rechargeable batteries, good for 500-1000 shots-per-charge (for DSLRs) and can be charged at least 50-100 times before needing to be replaced. That means you actually will not use up the battery before you have taken full advantage of the better value of digital photography.\n\nMarket conditions are forcing the price of digital photography to increase. The loss of market share of compact and ultra-compact digital cameras to cellphones forced manufacturers to discontinue such products and concentrate on higher-end offering.

{"conversations": ["How to love your body?", "## Develop the right mind set\n\n1. Do not compare yourself to others. Our standards for beauty are majorly influenced by media, Hollywood, and popular culture. Through these outlets, we develop negative judgements of our bodies by comparing ourselves to photoshopped pictures and glamorized movie stars. These images are created and altered by computers and are not realistic goals to achieve. Popular media can be hard to ignore, but you can loosen the grip of majority rule by deciding to love your body because your body is real. Whenever you see an image in a magazine, commercial ad, or some other media outlet, remind yourself that the image is false. The person you are looking at has most likely been air brushed and altered to look like that. You should not compare yourself to computerized images.\n2. Give yourself compliments. Having love in your life starts with loving yourself. You should view and treat yourself with the same kindness and admiration you would with someone you love. You probably wouldn't critique another person's body for the same things you critique on yourself. Don't hesitate to give yourself a compliment, go easy on your mistakes, and forgive yourself when you mess up. Drop the self-hatred, and replace it with understanding and appreciation. Look in the mirror and say \"I am attractive, confident, and amazing!\" Keep that up and eventually you will see yourself in a more positive light. When you accomplish a goal, let yourself know how proud you are of yourself. Look into a mirror and say, \"Great job, I am so proud of you.\"\n3. Practice gratitude. Appreciate what you have and love your inner-self. Do not let the number on the scale or your pant size define who you are or of what you are capable. Nothing good will come from being mean to yourself when you look in the mirror. Here are some ways to practice gratitude in your everyday life:\n\t* When a bad situation presents itself, do not let it get you down. Instead, ask yourself what you can learn from it when you look back on it and what you may be grateful for. Make a vow not to be negative or criticize for ten days. If you slip up, forgive yourself and keep going. You will notice how much energy you were wasting on negative thoughts. Keep a gratitude journal to write down the things you are grateful for everyday. Your body is a miracle, and you should celebrate all of the gifts your body has given you. Think about all of your great accomplishments, relationships, and activities you love that your body has allowed you to have and record them everyday.\n4. Make a list of all of the positive things in your life. Everyone has insecurities, but the key is focusing on what you like about yourself and your life. It can be easy to let the negatives outweigh the positives, but making a list can help prevent this. Start off by finding one thing that you like about yourself, no matter how small. Once you are feeling more confident in that thing, identify a second thing and so on. Build up a list of things you love about yourself, and when you hear a negative thought pop into your head, immediately refocus on the list. Eventually, you will see more positive qualities than negative.\n5. Steer clear of negativity. Stay away from people who often rant about their bodies. Their insecurities can rub off onto you and get you thinking about what problems you may have. Life is too precious to waste time self-loathing or knit-picking about your body, especially when your own self perceptions are usually more critical than what anyone else thinks. If someone starts to bash or criticize their own body or life, do not engage in the negativity. Instead, change the subject or make your exit.\n6. Exude confidence. When you act like you have confidence, you will feel good about yourself. Even if you don't feel like you have any, pretend. Pull back your shoulders, tilt your head up, and smile. Smiling is one of the biggest things you can do to improve both your self-image and the way others see you. If you hold yourself confidently, inner confidence will follow.\n\n\n## Practice healthy habit\n\n1. Practice healthy hygiene. To feel good about yourself, and show respect to your body, start every day with a refreshing shower. Use nice smelling soap, wash your face, and put deodorant on after you shower. This will keep you refreshed, confident around people, and help send positive thoughts to your mind.\n2. Wear comfortable clothes that help you feel good. Everything in your closet should complement your current body shape and appeal to you. Don't wear something uncomfortable just to impress others if it makes you feel self-conscious. Remember, you always look better being yourself. Wear clean clothes free of tears or rips to dress your body the way it deserves. Buy matching underwear and bras even if you are the only one who will see them. This tells your inner-self that you are doing this for you and only you.\n3. Commit to daily affirmations. Affirmations are positive statements that are meant to be repeated until the mind starts to believe them as true. Verbalizing what you like about yourself helps your brain to remember more easily than just thinking thoughts silently. You can personalize your daily affirmations however you see fit, just make sure they are positive statements. Here is a great statement to start with:\n\t* Everyday, look into a mirror, and say, \"I am beautiful; I am loved; I love myself as I am.\"\n4. Eat a well-balanced diet. Make a goal to eat fruits and vegetables each day to nourish your body and thank it for all that it gives you. This will not only give you a glow and long-lasting health benefits, but it will teach you how to respect your body. This does not mean that you have to stick to a strict dietary plan, but do make an effort to eliminate junk food and eat healthier to fuel your body.\n5. Get regular exercise. The best way to love your body is to partake in physical activities that are good for you and help you feel good. Don't just exercise to lose weight, but do it to take care of your heart and overall health. For example, yoga is good for relaxation, core strength and general well being, whereas sports are an excellent way to release energy productively and has been shown to improve mood.\n\n\n## Find support\n\n1. Ask others what they love about you. Although it may be scary and intimidating, ask your friends and loved ones what they think your best qualities are. This will help boost your confidence and remind you that your body has given you so many gifts. You will most likely be surprised at the wonderful things they see in you that you often miss. Here is a way you can ask:\n\t* Start off by giving your friend or loved one a great compliment, and then ask, \"What do you think is my best quality?\"\n2. Surround yourself with people who love themselves. People develop the attitude and behaviors of the people who surround them. If you keep positive influences in your life, you will adopt those attitudes which will help you love yourself, inside and out. Look for people who are optimistic, work hard toward their goals, and respect themselves.\n3. Follow after your role models. Think about all of the people either directly in your life, or those who have accomplished amazing things that you admire. Those individuals are most likely renowned and respected for their accomplishments outside of their bodies. Use this to help you remember that your body does not stand in the way of your life or happiness. Your body can help you pursue all of your dreams and desires. Think about your family members, close friends, or someone you have never met but always admired, and make a list of their best qualities. Then, ask yourself if their self-image or body made the list, or kept them from achieving their accomplishments.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A mental health professional, life coach, or self-help author who specializes in promoting body positivity, self-love, and personal growth.

{"conversations": ["How to clean plant leaves?", "Clean plants are a beautiful addition to your home and garden, and do a wonderful job of purifying the air. Choose a cleaning method that is safe for your plant, especially if your plant is sensitive to water. Experiment with different shine agents to add a beautiful glow to your plant leaves. Each of these strategies will leave your plants looking clean and shiny.\n\n## Remove dust and grime\n\n1. Wipe large, shiny leaves with a damp cloth. This is the best way to clean large plants, such as rubber plants, that are difficult to move. Dunk your cloth in water and then squeeze out any excess liquid. Gently wipe both sides of all of the leaves to remove any dust and grime. Microfiber cloths or cheesecloths work well for cleaning plants. Clean the leaves each time that you notice dust or dirt building up. This works well for both indoor and outdoor plants such as Gunnera, Plantain Lillies, and Elephant Ears. Place a drop of dishwashing liquid on the cloth if you notice insects eating or landing on your plant.\n2. Use a soft paintbrush to remove dust from plants with fuzzy leaves. Plants with fluffy leaves, such as African Violets, are quite delicate and shouldn\u2019t be wiped. Instead, gently brush any dust or insects off the leaves with a clean, soft paintbrush. If you don\u2019t have a soft paintbrush on-hand, use a pipe cleaner or soft toothbrush instead. Avoid wetting the leaves of fuzzy plants, as this can cause water spots to appear.\n3. Rinse indoor plant leaves with warm water to remove insects and dust. Place your indoor plant in the sink or shower and use the pressure of the water stream to remove any dust and dirt from the plant. The mist from the shower will also help to hydrate the plant\u2019s leaves. Leave the plants to drip-dry and then take them outside to dry in the sunshine. Always use warm water, as cold water can leave spots on the leaves. Don\u2019t wash plants, such as cacti and African Violets, that are sensitive to water. This method works well for Peace Lilies, Sword Ferns, and Devils Ivy.\n4. Dunk small plants into water to quickly get rid of dust. Place your hand over the soil to keep it in place and then turn the plant upside down and submerge the plant in room temperature water. This is a great option for small houseplants and outdoor plants. Allow the plants to drip-dry out of direct light.\n5. Spray compressed air onto cacti to avoid getting them wet. Cacti are used to desert conditions and will often wilt and die if they are over-watered. Spray air from an air compressor can over the spikes to dislodge any dust or dirt from the cacti. Hold the can 10 centimetres (3.9 in) away from the cacti to avoid damaging the spikes. Purchase an air-compressor can from a hardware store or a plant nursery. This works well for both spiky and smooth cacti.\n\n\n## Add shine\n\n1. Rub a thin coat of mayonnaise over the leaves to keep them shiny. Squeeze a little mayonnaise onto a paper towel and wipe it over the leaves. Cover the entire leave with a light enough coat that it cannot be seen. Remove any excess mayonnaise with a clean paper towel. This shiny coating will last for approximately 2 weeks. Simply reapply the mayonnaise to restore the shine of the leaves. This method works for all types of plants.\n2. Cover the leaves in a thin layer of mineral oil for a long-lasting glow. Mineral oil provides a shiny coating for the leaves and helps to prevent dust from accumulating quickly. Simply place a drop of mineral oil onto each leaf and use your fingers to evenly spread it over the top side of the leaf. Use this method on any type of plant. Avoid using coconut or olive oil on the leaves, as this can block the pores of the plant. Keep plants with mineral oil on them out of the direct sun to avoid the leaves from getting burnt. Reapply the mineral oil once or twice per year.\n3. Spray a commercial plant shining product onto the leaves to add sheen. These sprays are specially formulated to keep your plant leaves looking shiny. Liberally spray the product over all the leaves on your plants. If you are spraying outdoor plants, choose a product that is designed for outdoor plants. Purchase a plant shining spray from a plant store. Follow the application instructions on the packet. This is a great option for cacti, as you don\u2019t have to touch the plant.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A software development manager or team lead who is seeking to improve the efficiency and adaptability of their team.

Keep the cutting board on a flat, stable surface. Make sure it can't slide around while you're coring the apple. Since you're going to be using a knife, it's easy to slip and nick your fingers if you're not careful. Try putting something underneath the cutting board to help hold it in place. A damp towel or paper towel works well in a pinch when dealing with wobbly cutting boards. There are also non-stick cutting board mats you can get online and at kitchen supply stores.\n2. Poke the tip of a paring knife into the top of the apple. While holding the apple steady, push the knife into it about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from its stem. You are aiming for the spot where the core ends. Cutting any closer to the stem could puncture the core and leave you with more of a mess to clean up later. If you don't have a paring knife handy, another thin blade will do. Choose the thinnest one you have in order to limit damage to the apple's flesh while you go after the core.\n3. Push the blade all the way through the apple. Hold the knife steady as you push it straight down so it doesn't cut into the core. Watch out for the sharp tip of the knife coming through the bottom's end! Tip the apple over on its side for a moment so you are able to see where the knife emerges. Coring is easiest with a knife that is longer than the apple. That way, you can remove the entire core in one go. If you don't have a knife like that, stick with a paring knife and scrape away any parts of the core left behind after the initial cut.\n4. Cut all the way around the core to separate it from the apple. Hold the apple steady and carefully cut in a circle without slicing into the core. Keep the blade \u20444 in (0.64 cm) from the stem the entire time. This can be a little tricky to do at first, but it becomes much easier with practice. It leaves the core loose inside the apple, making it easy to remove by hand. If you're having trouble keeping the cut consistent all the way around the stem, try making more incisions. Place the knife on another side of the stem and push it all the way through the bottom again. Do this 4 times on all sides of the stem, then cut in a circle to connect the incisions.\n5. Remove the knife and push out the core with your thumbs. Raise the knife slowly so you don't lose control of it. Set it aside, then give the stem a good, hard push. The core will pop out through the bottom of the apple. If it is stuck, cut around the core again to separate it from the rest of the apple. Another option is to use the tip of the knife to pry the core up toward you. Once you are able to get a firm grip on it, pull it up to remove it. Knife control is important when doing this, so raise it with patience rather than yanking it toward you.\n6. Cut around the inside of the apple if you notice any seeds remaining. Sometimes these parts break off the core and get left behind. Put the knife back in the hole and scrape around the outside edge. Push the inedible bits out through the holes in the apple to throw them away. Once you're sure you got all of the black seeds and stringy bits of the core, you're ready to cook the apple.You could also use a melon baller to scoop out the insides. Twist the melon baller around to clear out the cut, leaving it clean and consistent.\n\n\n## Use an apple corer\n\n1. Place the apple on a flat surface with the stem face up. Set it up on something stable and damage-resistant like a cutting board. Coring tools are pretty sharp, so don't sacrifice your countertop for the sake of an apple core. Make sure you have plenty of room to hold the apple steady while coring it. Test the cutting board or surface by attempting to move or shake it. If it seems unsteady, expect it to move at the worst time. Try putting a wet towel or a non-slip mat underneath a cutting board to steady it.\n2. Place the apple corer on the center of the apple. If you have a tube-shaped corer, position it so the apple's stem is in the middle of the tube. Push the corer down until it begins cutting into the apple. If you have a combination corer and peeler, position it \u20444 in (0.64 cm) from the core with the serrated edge facing inward. Push the tip down into the apple to begin separating its flesh from the core. The easiest type of corer to use is one with a long handle and a circular tube with a serrated bottom edge. The tube fits over the core, holding it together while you pull it out. When using the vegetable peeler type of corer, you have to twist the blade around in a circle to cut out the core. The motion is the same as when using a tube-shaped corer, but it takes a little more work to rotate the corer by hand. You could also use a flat, ring-shaped corer. This type slices up the apple while removing the core. It's great for cutting an apple into wedges with one fell swoop.\n3. Twist the corer as you push it toward the bottom of the apple. This takes a little bit of force, so keep a firm grip on both the apple and the handle of the corer. Rotate the corer back and forth while pushing down on it. As long as you keep the apple still, the corer will go straight down toward the opposite end of the core. If you're using the blade-type corer, push it down into the apple and begin rotating it around the core. It will separate the core from the rest of the apple.\n4. Pull the corer out to remove the center membrane and seeds. What happens next depends on what kind of corer you have. With many tube-shaped corers, all you have to do is pull the handle back to take the core out with it. For blade-like corers, lift the blade out and then push the core out with your fingers. Check the inside of the apple for leftover seeds. Corers are better at cleaning out an apple than knives, but a loose seed or core fragment can fall out of the tool and get left behind.\n\n\n## Scoop the core out of a halve apple\n\n1. Set the apple on a stable cutting surface. Use a cutting board to prevent your countertop from getting damaged. Start by standing the apple up on the board with the stem face up. Make sure the cutting board can't move at all while you're working. Stabilize the cutting board by placing a towel or mat underneath it if needed.\n2. Cut the apple in half to expose the core. Use a sharp knife to split the apple. Hold it steady and cut vertically through it to the bottom. Try to slice through the center in a single, clean motion. You will end up going straight through the core, but that is okay. If you wish to quarter the apple, you could turn the halves over onto their cut sides. Slice them top to bottom down the middle. Whether you do this before or after removing the core doesn't make much of a difference.\n3. Scoop out the core using a spoon or melon baller. Keep the apple halves flat against the cutting board with the skin side down. This will give you a clear view of the seeds and the fibrous sheaths in the center of each slice. They are pretty easy to remove by digging into the apple's flesh right where it meets the hard, stringy core. Clean out both halves to leave the juicy part of the apple intact. If you quartered the apples, an alternative way to remove the core is by cutting underneath it. Use a paring knife to cut diagonally down to the center point underneath the core. Turn the apple slice around and cut from the other side to cleanly lift away the core.\n4. Slice away the stem and bud on each half with a paring knife. Keep the apple halves skin side down on the cutting board. The stem and bud are on the ends of each half, right above the removed center. Hold your knife parallel to these parts and cut diagonally down underneath them. Slice diagonally down from the opposite side to complete the cut and remove the inedible parts. There are pieces of the stem and bud on both halves, so remember to get them all. You will need to make a total of 4 cuts on each half, 2 apiece for each stem and bud. Another way to do this is by scooping out the stem and bud with a melon baller or spoon. It is less precise than cutting, so it takes away more of the juicy flesh.\n\n\n## Separate the core from a peel apple\n\n1. Peel the apple using a paring knife or vegetable peeler. If you have a good vegetable peeler handy, use it for an easy way to remove the apple's skin. Drag it from the top of the apple to the bottom to remove a layer of skin. After setting aside the peel, rotate the apple and use the peeler again and again to expose the juicy flesh.If you're using a knife, slip the tip of the blade underneath the skin. Peel from side to side across the apple, moving slowly to keep the blade as close to the skin as possible. Although using a knife gets easier with practice, you could slip and cut into the good part of the apple if you're not careful.\n2. Set the apple down on a flat surface with the stem side up. Stand the apple on a safe, stable cutting board. Make sure the board won't slide out of place while you attempt to cut the apple. As long as the board is secure, cutting the stem out is a quick and safe process.For your own safety and the sake of the apple, slip a damp towel or non-stick mat underneath a cutting board to prevent it from moving while you work.\n3. Slice across the apple to separate part of it from the stem. Pick up a sharp chef's knife and position it about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from the stem. Hold onto the apple with your other hand to stop it from moving. When you're ready, slice straight down, all the way to the bottom of the apple. This will separate part of the apple, leaving the core untouched and standing on your cutting board.Cut as close to the stem as you can to save the edible portions of the apple. If you cut too close to the stem, you might end up taking out some of the core. Cut the hard, stringy core chunks off the apple slices before using them.\n4. Turn the apple and cut away the other sides to remove the core. Rotate the apple so an uncut side faces you. Cut across it again and then all the way down to the bottom. Keep the knife \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from the stem at all times so all the cut parts are even. When you're done, you will have 4 apple chunks that are clean and easy to slice up into whatever size you need.For example, lay the portions flat on the cutting board and cut them from top to bottom to create slices. Cut the slices from side to side to create smaller apple chunks.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A home cook or baking enthusiast who is looking for a practical guide on how to prepare apples for various recipes.

{"conversations": ["How to buy school supplies?", "Shopping for school supplies can be stressful for both the seasoned shopper and the beginner. Working parents or guardians have to fight the crowds that gather on weekends or after the end of the workday. Even worse, the cost of school supplies steadily increases every year, costing families an average of just under $100 in 2015. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to stress out or go bankrupt. By spacing out your purchases and practicing a few money-saving hacks, you can survive the back-to-school madness.\n\n## Buy basic supply\n\n1. Get a list from your child\u2019s school. Don\u2019t rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isn\u2019t available on the school\u2019s website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites.\n2. Know the difference between requests and requirements. Before you panic over the long supply list on the school\u2019s website, realize that many of the items are merely requests. One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.\n3. Purchase writing supplies. Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper. Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art. Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but it\u2019s always a good idea to check the supply list in case your child\u2019s teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners. Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.\n4. Buy folders. Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc. ).\n5. Purchase a day planner. Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.\n6. Buy art supplies. Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.\n7. Purchase personal supplies. Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack. Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.\n8. Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag. Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time. However, textbooks haven\u2019t gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.\n\n\n## Shop for electronics\n\n1. Buy a calculator. High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:\n\t* Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30. Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.\n2. Purchase a computer. High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list. Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget.\n3. Buy external storage. Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.\n\n\n## Save money\n\n1. Sort out what you already have. Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldn\u2019t mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s). Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt. Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.\n2. Stick to basics and generics. Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Don\u2019t worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs.\n3. Take advantage of discounts. Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back. Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.\n4. Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks. Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.\n5. Buy refurbished. Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost. However, you should do your homework first. Only buy refurbished products from trusted retailers like Apple or Best Buy, which offer warranties and free repairs on known issues.\n6. Buy a little at a time throughout the year. There\u2019s no rule that you have to buy school supplies in July and August. Each time you\u2019re shopping for groceries or picking up a prescription, stop by the school supply aisle to look for unannounced discounts on common required supplies.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A marine biologist, environmental scientist, or researcher who is passionate about conservation and the preservation of marine life.

{"conversations": ["How to freeze lasagna?", "Freezing homemade lasagna is a great way to have ready-made meals on hand for nights when it's all you can do to turn the oven on and heat up dinner. When you make lasagna and freeze it for later, you'll have a homemade, healthy meal on hand whenever you need it. You can freeze lasagna baked or unbaked, but you'll need to thaw it overnight before cooking it to serve. See Step 1 to learn how to freeze lasagna so that it stays fresh-tasting.\n\n## Prepare the lasagna\n\n1. Make a freezer-friendly lasagna recipe. Some ingredients taste better than others when they're reheated after being frozen. Most lasagna recipes that call for fresh ingredients will be just fine after freezing, whether you freeze them unbaked or baked. However, if the recipe uses items that have already been frozen and thawed once, it's best not to freeze and thaw them twice. This increases the chance that the food could be contaminated by bacteria. For example, don't plan on freezing lasagna made with sausage or ground beef that was previously frozen. Instead, use fresh meat or leave it out completely. Food that is frozen and thawed more than once also suffers when it comes to flavor and texture. Choosing a recipe that calls for fresh ingredients will result in the best-tasting lasagna. If your favorite lasagna recipe calls for a frozen ingredient, the final dish usually won't be too affected by substituting the fresh version instead. For example, instead of using frozen mushrooms, just use fresh. In most cases you will have needed to thaw them anyway.\n2. Assemble the lasagna in a dish that can be frozen. Look for a \"freezer-proof\" label or be certain that the dish can be frozen as well as used for baking. Most glass or ceramic casserole dishes are fine for this purpose. Avoid using an aluminum pan for long-term storage of lasagna. The food might end up picking up a tinny taste. If you don't have a dish that can be used to both bake and freeze lasagna, you can bake it one dish and freeze it in a freezer-safe food storage container.\n3. Decide whether to bake it first. Lasagna that has been baked before freezing will still taste great after it has been reheated. Lasagna that has been assembled and frozen before baking is delicious, too. Use whichever method is most convenient for you, since the final texture and taste of the dish won't be too affected either way. You might decide to freeze pre-baked lasagna if you have leftovers after making a big batch. If you'd rather freeze it before baking, consider making two lasagnas next time you're having lasagna for dinner. You can bake one and freeze the other to eat later.\n4. Bring the lasagna to room temperature. If you want to freeze baked lasagna, it's necessary to make sure it has cooled entirely before you freeze it. Otherwise, the texture of the dish won't be as pleasant when it's time to eat it. After making the lasagna, set it aside for one hour to cool. You can also place it into the refrigerator to chill. Before placing it in the fridge, cover the lasagna with two layers of plastic wrap and one layer of kitchen foil.\n5. Cover the lasagna with freezer-safe plastic wrap. Don't use aluminum foil, since it might affect the taste of the lasagna. Cover it with several layers of plastic wrap to keep it fresh in the freezer. You may want to wrap the plastic around the entire dish, rather than just over the top. That way, you can make sure there are no gaps in the wrap where air could get in and cause freezer burn. Consider cutting the lasagna into individual portions and freezing them in bags. This way you won't have to reheat the entire thing if you only need a meal for one or two people. Cut the lasagna into serving sized-portions after it has chilled. This will help the pieces hold together better instead of falling apart. Put each piece in its own freezer-safe storage bag. No matter what, make sure it is double wrapped to prevent the lasagna from drying out.\n6. Freeze the lasagna. Label it and place it in the freezer. It can be frozen for up to three months, whether it has a meat or vegetable filling.\n\n\n## Thaw and reheat lasagna\n\n1. Thaw it overnight. The night before you intend to have the lasagna for dinner, thaw it overnight. If you try to bake it while it's still partially frozen, it will cook unevenly and the taste and texture will be affected. It will also be more difficult to determine whether it's done or not. You can thaw either the entire lasagna or portions in the refrigerator overnight.\n2. Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC/350\u00baF. This is the standard cooking temperature for lasagna. No matter what recipe you used, this is a good temperature for baking your lasagna to perfection.\n3. Ready the lasagna for baking. Unwrap all of the plastic wrap, and cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. This will keep the top from getting too brown while the rest of the lasagna cooks. If you're cooking an individual portion of lasagna, take the piece you want to bake out of its storage bag and place it on a suitable baking dish, then cover with foil.\n4. Bake the lasagna. Put it in the oven and cook it half an hour to 40 minutes, or until heated through. You may need to test a small piece from the center to make sure it isn't still cold in the middle. During the last 10 minutes of baking, you can remove the foil to allow the heat to reach the top if you want a brown, crispy crust on your lasagna. If you're just reheating an individual piece of lasagna, you can do it in the microwave instead of in the oven. Place it on a microwave-safe dish and microwave on high for 2 - 3 minutes, or until it's hot and bubbly. Do not use aluminum foil in the microwave.\n5. Serve the lasagna. Since it has been in the freezer for awhile, you might want to freshen it up by sprinkling some chipped basil or oregano on top.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A culinary professional, restaurant owner, or chef with a strong commitment to sustainability and efficient kitchen operations.

{"conversations": ["How to address a queen?", "Queens are typically addressed as \"Your Majesty,\" but in modern times there is rarely any enforcement or punishment for getting it wrong. Queen Elizabeth II, the most famous living monarch, has been winked at by a U.S. president, among many other gaffes she's witnessed over the years. The royal family lives on, and the correct etiquette to use remains, at least in the British case, a suggested tradition rather than a requirement.\n\n## Address queen elizabeth ii in a letter\n\n1. Decide whether to use traditional forms. According to the Royal Family's official policy, you should be free to write in whatever style you like. Politeness and respect will make any letter more kindly received, but that does not necessarily equate to using formal terms. Stay sincere, and do not use the formal terms below if they make you uncomfortable.\n2. Begin the letter with \"Madam.\" At the top of your letter, write \"Madam,\" skip a line, and start writing your letter on the line below it. This is the formal and traditional term of address when writing a letter to the Queen of the United Kingdom.\n3. Conclude the letter with a respectful term. The traditional written conclusion is I have the honour to be, Madam, Your Majesty's most humble and obedient servant, followed by your name. If you find this conclusion distasteful due to the declaration of servitude, or the insertion of the letter u in honour, consider one of the following respectful conclusions instead:\n\t* With greatest respect,\n\t* Yours faithfully,\n\t* Yours sincerely,\n4. Mail the letter. On the envelope, write the following postal address, using the last line only if you are mailing the letter from outside the UK:\n\t* The Queen\n\t* Buckingham Palace\n\t* London SW1A 1AA\n\t* United Kingdom\n\n\n## Address queen elizabeth ii in person\n\n1. Make a small curtsy, bow, or nod. Traditionally, women do a discreet curtsy and men bow from the neck when they meet the Queen of the United Kingdom. This is no longer required, but citizens of the Commonwealth usually choose to use this greeting. People who are not subjects of the Queen often prefer to use a slight nod instead. Do not bow from the waist.\n2. Politely shake the Queen's hand if offered. The Queen may or may not offer her hand, although there is no special significance to one decision or the other. If she does offer her hand, take it in a brief, gentle handshake. Do not offer your hand first.\n3. Wait for Her Majesty to address you. A good general rule, in fact, is not to initiate an action or conversation until the Queen has addressed you directly. Needless to say, wait until the Queen finishes speaking before you reply.\n4. Address her as \"Your Majesty\" the first time in the conversation. If you are stuck for words, say \"Hello, Your Majesty. I am delighted to meet you.\" Any polite greeting is acceptable, however.\n5. Address her as \"Ma'am\" for the rest of the conversation. For the rest of the conversation, say, \"Ma'am,\" pronounced to rhyme with \"jam.\" You may use the term \"Your Majesty\" again if you are asking her a question or introducing someone, but \"Ma'am\" will do most of the time.\n6. Don't ask personal questions. Most likely, the Queen will be guiding the conversation. But if you contribute your own small talk, avoid asking her about her family or personal life.\n7. Don't turn your back on the Queen until the conversation is over. Remain facing her or standing to the side throughout the conversation. Turn away or leave only when the conversation is over. And of course, don't forget to give her a proper good-bye and thank Her Majesty for the unexpected opportunity.\n\n\n## Address queen of other nations\n\n1. Try to find the specific form of address. Monarchies often have specific terms of address borne of their countries' traditions. Search online or in etiquette books for the terms of address for the specific monarchy.\n2. When in doubt, use \"Your Majesty.\" The term \"Your Majesty\" is common and unlikely to cause offense. This term is the proper way to address most queens, from Queen Pengiran Anak Saleha of Brunei, to Queen Mathilde of Belgium. Use \"Her Majesty\" instead of \"her\" when writing or speaking about these queens in the third person.\n3. Address Empresses as \"Her Imperial Majesty.\" If a monarch's title includes \"Empress,\" or if the nation she heads traditionally considers itself an empire, she should be addressed as \"Her Imperial Majesty.\"\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an urban designer, landscape architect, or city planner with a focus on sustainable and inclusive urban development.

{"conversations": ["How to clean slate?", "Slate is a stone that brings natural beauty into the home, and can be expensive to install. Regular maintenance cleaning can help preserve slate. But sometimes, it needs a deep clean or stain removal. A combination of regular cleaning and an occasional deep clean can help keep your slate in good condition.\n\n## Maintain a regular clean routine\n\n1. Sweep or remove dust and debris regularly. If you have slate floors, it is important to sweep daily or several times a week. Dust can damage slate over time by wearing away the surface. Keeping a regular cleaning schedule can prevent this damage. Use a dry broom or cloth for this step.\n2. Mix a solution of mild soap and water. For this, you will need a large bucket full of warm water. Mix in a little bit of soap. Dish soap works well for this.\n3. Mop or wipe the surface. Gently wipe the surface of the slate using small circular motions. This motion will loosen and lift dried-on dust and dirt. Use a soft mop, made from materials such as a microfiber. Stiff bristles can damage the stone. For vertical surfaces, clean from the bottom up. Slate should be cleaned with soap every 2-3 months.\n4. Rinse the slate with water. Rinse out your bucket and mop first, and then use them to rinse the slate with water. Soap buildup can attract more dirt, meaning you will have to clean your slate again.\n5. Dry the slate with a fresh, dry, soft cloth. This will remove any streaks from forming on the slate that may occur from air drying and prevent slipping on floor surfaces.\n\n\n## Clean deeply\n\n1. Sweep and mop the slate. Start with removing dry dust and debris by sweeping. Then mop or wipe the slate surface with a soft cloth or microfiber mop in soapy water. Allow the surface to dry.\n2. Apply teak oil to the slate. After the surface is completely dry, apply teak oil to a clean, dry cloth. Using small, circular motions, apply cloth to the slate to cover it in a thin layer of teak oil. Designated slate oil is also available to buy at some hardware stores. However, it tends to be more expensive. Teak oil will achieve the same results.\n3. Clean grout between slate tiles. Mix a solution in a spray bottle that is 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water. You can find hydrogen peroxide at hardware stores or pharmacies. Spray the solution onto the grout. Avoid direct contact with the eyes when using hydrogen peroxide. Repeat this step as needed if the grout doesn't look clean after the first round.\n4. Reapply sealant as needed. Sealant protects slate from some everyday wear and tear, and is used on interior surfaces. Each sealant is different, so be sure to follow the specific instructions that come with it. In general, apply at least two layers and allow the sealant to dry completely between coats. Each sealant will come with instructions about how often to reapply it.\n\n\n## Remove a stain\n\n1. Mix a solution in a spray bottle that is 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water. Allow the mixture to sit for around 10 minutes.\n2. Spray the solution onto the stain and scrub. Using a soft-bristled brush or microfiber cloth, scrub the stain with small, circular motions. If the stain does not come out, a stronger solution may be needed.\n3. Mix a solution of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. Add a few spoonfuls of baking soda to the peroxide until the mixture becomes bubbly. Wait until the bubbles stop.\n4. Apply the solution to the stain. Once the peroxide and baking soda mix has set, you can wipe it away with a clean cloth.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A computer science or data science professional with expertise in machine learning and deep learning.

{"conversations": ["How to speak english?", "English is a language which is spoken all around the world, and learning to speak it can help you meet new people and advance your career. Learning to speak English can be hard, but with practice and patience, you can become fluent in your new language.\n\n## Get the basics down\n\n1. Start simple. Very few people are true beginners when it comes to English. \"Hello,\" \"hi,\" \"How are you?\" and numerals have infiltrated most societies. Odds are you know more English than you think. Take what you know. For example, \"How are you?\" That uses the verb \"to be.\" What are other questions just like this? Take what you know and expand it! How is she?How is your father?How are your children?How is the weather? Start memorizing verbs. The top ten most common verbs in English are the following: \"be,\" \"have,\" \"do,\" \"say,\" \"get,\" \"make,\" \"go,\" \"know,\" \"take,\" and \"see.\" Just knowing these verbs can get you through a lot of basic conversations. English is subject-verb-object, in that order. Your subject pronouns are: \"I,\" \"you,\" \"he\"/\"she\"/\"it,\" \"we,\" \"you,\" \"they.\" Object pronouns in English are: \"me,\" \"you,\" \"him\"/\"her\"/\"it,\" \"us,\" \"you,\" \"them.\" With those verbs and knowing English is SVO, what sentences can you come up with? I know her.She makes it.He takes us.\n2. Practice conversations. Once you have basic subject and object pronouns down and a handful of verbs, you can start asking questions. Questions often open with \"who,\" \"what,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" \"why,\" and \"how.\" \"Who\" indicates a person; \"what\" indicates a thing; \"when\" indicates a time; \"where\" indicates a place; \"why\" indicates a reason; \"how\" indicates a manner. Say you know the subjects, some basic nouns, those ten verbs, and these question starters. What are some things you could ask an English speaker? What is your name?What do you do?When is your birthday?Where is she?Why do you have it?How do you know?\n\n\n## Get familiar with the grammar\n\n1. Start with the present tenses. Let's start with present simple and present continuous:\n\t* Present simple is used for facts and habits. If you are describing something that is true or something that happens often, opt for the present simple. I go to work every day.She eats breakfast at 7.China is a big country. Present continuous is used for things that are happening right now. There are two verbs: a helper and a main verb. The helper is \"am\"/\"is\"/\"are\" (depending on the subject) and the main verb is any verb with -ing:\n\t* You are reading.I am typing.He is watching TV.\n2. Move to the past and future tenses. Once you've mastered the present, get started on the past and future tenses. We're just going to go over the basic ones now:\n\t* Use the past simple for any event that happened in the past at a specific time. I saw that movie last year.She died on a plane.We went to the bank yesterday. For the future, let's keep it simple. Add a future time marker, and just use the present continuous! It can double as a future tense, too. They are making a cake tomorrow.You are leaving in May.I am going at 6 pm.\n3. Put your adjectives before nouns. Always, always, always put the adjective (the word that describes) before the noun. Always! In fact, there's even an order within adjectives:\n\t* There are eight basic types of adjectives: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, and purpose. If you have more than one, they go in that order. So, it's a \"huge, round, metal bowl\" or a \"small, red sleeping bag.\"\n\n\n## Maintain progress\n\n1. Label everything. Take the objects in your house and label them with their English equivalent. The goal is to get your mind thinking in English. When it's right there, it'll be impossible to ignore. When you've labeled everything and find yourself thinking, \"Where is my blanket?\" try to think of the word (or sentence) in English. When you find your blanket, were you right? Don't write on the objects--grab a slip of paper and tape it on sturdily.\n2. Keep an eye on your pronunciation. It's very easy to get caught up in memorizing words when pronunciation can be just as important. Unfortunately, English has exceptions to most rules. But there are still some general guidelines you can abide by:\n\t* Always say the last sounds in the word. Certain Asian dialects find this rather difficult. If you know you're guilty of this, keep it in mind. \"Streets\" is not pronounced stree. The \"ts\" is very important in retaining meaning. Take the sentence \"I project the project will end soon.\" Confusing, huh? Isn't English SVO? Yes, and this sentence is too. The first \"project\" (verb) is pronounced pro-JECT; the second (noun) is pronounced PRO-ject. The same is true for all verb-noun pairs: nouns stress the first syllable, verbs the second. Though there are definite exceptions, most nouns in English have the first syllable stressed. Think of the nouns in your house: \"BED-room,\" \"BATH-room,\" \"KITCH-en,\" \"TA-ble,\" \"WIN-dow,\" \"SO-fa,\" \"WA-ter,\" \"JACK-et,\" \"TOI-let,\" etc.\n3. Pick a dialect. There are meaningful differences between American, British, and Australian English. Before you go about increasing your vocabulary, which one appeals to you? Sometimes it's very important to know who you're speaking to. If you tell an American, Canadian, or Australian you're not wearing pants, they might wonder if you're wearing shorts, a dress, a skirt, or just in your underwear. If you tell a British person you're not wearing pants, you're going commando! In addition to vocabulary differences, the pronunciation differences are huge. Know these variations exist before you get confused with multiple correct pronunciations. Certain dictionaries use British English and certain dictionaries prefer American. Choose the one that's best for you.\n\n\n## Use your resources\n\n1. Get a good dictionary. If you need to, get several. A dictionary to translate between your first language and English is best, in addition to a dictionary in English only. Get a pocket-sized version for when you're on the go and that pesky word you keep forgetting comes up.\n2. Speak in English with native speakers. Though it may be tempting to speak with your other friends who are learning too, you'll see the quickest results if you converse mainly with native speakers. Hire a tutor or private teacher. Make sure they're native and have the accent you want. Choose someone with teaching experience--just because you can speak a language does not mean you can teach it. If a teacher isn't up your alley, get a penpal!\n3. Use the internet. There are literally hundreds upon hundreds of sites you can use to your benefit. Anything to make grammar more exciting is welcome--there are games and videos galore. Such resources can be found at Simple English Wikipedia, the British Council, and English Club, among many others. YouTube doesn't have to be about funny animals and popular music. Tap into its educational resources as well.\n4. Watch TV, listen to songs, and read books. Though your goal is to speak English, you have to be able to understand it, too! Even when you're alone and not stuck in a grammar exercise you can keep your mind primed. Start with children's books and TV shows. The language is simpler and will go slower. Eventually, move to channels catered to your interests. If you enjoy cooking, graduate to the Food Network and see what you can pick up on. Try not to turn on the captions! If you have a DVR, record the shows. That way you can go back and work through the dialogue and conversations at your own pace. Listen to English music! Ballads go quite slowly and the refrains can be rather repetitive. Your vocabulary will naturally expand, too.\n5. Think in English. If you find yourself thinking something simple in you native tongue, what would its equivalent be in English? Make a habit of this for maintenance and memory. Think out loud if helps. Explain to your roommates or family what you're trying to do; maybe they'll want to catch on, too! Eventually, simple phrases will become par for the course.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A dedicated English teacher, instructional designer, or educational researcher with expertise in teaching English as a foreign language, particularly to young learners.

{"conversations": ["Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20\u00b0C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.", "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp. Perparing food outside in the cold takes a lot longer than in a heated kitchen, severly limits what you can do, and may also risk predator encounters depending on what is around your area in the winter."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A young, adventurous, and resourceful individual embarking on an unconventional living experiment in Stockholm.

You can produce fatal errors, too (```E_USER_ERROR```) but those aren't recoverable. If you trigger one of those, program execution stops at that point. This is why, for fatal errors, Exceptions should be used.

We don't hear about all the cases where everything is fine. It is unclear why math advisors should inherently be better people than in any other field, and there is no empirical evidence that warrants this. However, a few of the specific issues you mention are perhaps less likely to arise in mathematics, due to cultural and structural reasons.\n\n>\"my advisor has stopped funding me\"\n\nIn the US, at least, the main avenue of funding for math graduate students is through teaching assistantships, since math departments teach a large number of service courses. Faculty who have grants can sometimes offer their students a research assistantship instead, so that the student doesn't have to teach. But a student really isn't completely reliant on their advisor for funding. Moreover, there typically aren't major expenses for the research itself (no expensive equipment, etc), so as long as the student is getting paid, research can continue.\n(This is not necessarily the case in other countries.)\n\n>\"my advisor wants to be 1st author, when I did the majority of the work!\"\n\nThe general practice in mathematics is that all authors are listed alphabetically, and the concept of \"first authorship\" does not exist. As such, people don't bother to keep track of who did the \"majority\" of the work. Thus this particular issue doesn't arise in mathematics.\n\n>\"my advisor is stealing my ideas!\"\n\nWhile individual departments may vary, I think there's a general sense in mathematics that a joint paper \"counts\" about the same as a solo paper. As such, if a student has contributed to a project, the advisor has no particular incentive not to include them as an author on the paper.\n\n>\"my advisor wants to add another student to the paper and this is unfair!\"\n\nAs above, it isn't any particular disadvantageous to a student if another student is added.", "I agree with most of this, except that in mathematics I think a joint paper *published by a student with their thesis advisor* is usually worth distinctly less than a solo paper by the student -- within the standard culture of mathematics, the former indicates an unusual amount of help.

{"conversations": ["In this Creation magazine reprint of a 1994 article titled Exploding stars point to a young universe,  Young-Earth Creationist, Jonathan Sarfati argues that the scarcity of Supernova remnants (SNRs) in the sky suggests the Milky Way galaxy is less than billions of years old.\n\nOn average, a galaxy like our own, the Milky Way, should produce one supernova every 25 years.\n[...]\nAs can be readily seen above, a young universe model fits the data of the low number of observed SNRs. If the universe was really billions of years old, there are 7000 missing SNRs in our galaxy.\n\nDoes astronomy predict a Milky Way supernova every 25 years? Are there missing SNRs that undermine these predictions?", "There are many reasons why this is wrong. The first one is the assumption of 1 supernova per 25 years. That was the value arrived at in Gustav Tammann's article published in 1970. Others got values up to 100 years (Tammann himself changed his value later). All these values are really only good guesses.\n\nWorse errors are made in the percentage of remnants that should be visible. To start with, only a small percentage of them are visible; the others are obscured by dust in the galaxy. This does not happen to the same extent to the supernovas themselves, as they are intrinsically very much brighter. \n\nSarfati also uses an old paper to come up with the number of remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way). However, that figure was considered to be wrong (and much smaller) in later studies. Older remnants are very difficult to distinguish against a background of dust in the galaxy. Many of them disappear completely after about 10,000 years or so.\n\nIt should be noted that, using Sarfati's own reasoning, we should not be able to see any remnants older than 6000 years. Instead, we know of remnants (e.g. G166.2 + 2.5) that are over 100,000 years old. How did those originate in his universe? The same goes for the distance to supernovas. The distance to SN 1987A has been trigonometrically measured at 167,000 light years (the paper says 51,200 parsecs). In other words, its light took more than 30 times longer to reach us than the creationist universe has supposedly existed. \n\nRemember also that a supernova typically becomes either a pulsar or a black hole, both of which are very hard to observe. A black hole can only be \"seen\" through its effects on other matter, and a pulsar is mainly visible if the solar system happens to be in line with its sweeping radio beam (with some pulsars the star itself has also been seen). Hence, all we can see of them long after the event is an expanding cloud of gas that gets dimmer over the millennia.\n\nThere are several other reasons which are covered in a very good article on TalkOrigins.

This doesn't do what you expect.\nWhen the object passed to ```await``` is not a Promise, ```await``` simply returns the value as-is immediately instead of trying to resolve it. So since you passed ```await``` an array (of Promise objects) here instead of a Promise, the value returned by await is simply that array, which is of type ```Promise[]```.\nWhat you probably want to do is call ```Promise.all``` on the array returned by ```map``` in order to convert it to a single Promise before ```await```ing it.\nAccording to the MDN docs for ```Promise.all```:\n\nThe ```Promise.all(iterable)``` method returns a promise that resolves\nwhen all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved, or\nrejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects.\n\nSo in your case:\n```var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nvar results: number[] = await Promise.all(arr.map(async (item): Promise => {\n    await callAsynchronousOperation(item);\n    return item + 1;\n}));\n```\nThis will resolve the specific error you are encountering here.\nDepending on exactly what it is you're trying to do you may also consider using ```Promise.allSettled```, ```Promise.any```, or ```Promise.race``` instead of ```Promise.all```, though in most situations (almost certainly including this one) ```Promise.all``` will be the one you want."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "a software developer or programmer with experience in TypeScript and JavaScript, who is looking for solutions to resolve issues with asynchronous programming and type compatibility in TypeScript.

{"conversations": ["I have a new SPA with a stateless authentication model using JWT. I am often asked to refer OAuth for authentication flows like asking me to send 'Bearer tokens' for every request instead of a simple token header but I do think that OAuth is a lot more complex than a simple JWT based authentication. What are the main differences, should I make the JWT authentication behave like OAuth?\nI am also using the JWT as my XSRF-TOKEN to prevent XSRF but I am being asked to keep them separate? Should I keep them separate? Any help here will be appreciated and might lead to a set of guidelines for the community.", "TL;DR If you have very simple scenarios, like a single client application, a single API then it might not pay off to go OAuth 2.0. On the other hand, if there are lots of different clients (browser-based, native mobile, server-side, etc) then sticking to OAuth 2.0 rules might make it more manageable than trying to roll your own system.\n\n## Detailed Answer\n\nJWT (Learn JSON Web Tokens) is just a token format. It defines a compact and self-contained mechanism for transmitting data between parties in a way that can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. Additionally, the encoding rules of a JWT also make these tokens very easy to use within the context of HTTP.\n\nBeing self-contained (the actual token contains information about a given subject), they are also a good choice for implementing stateless authentication mechanisms (aka Look mum, no sessions!). When going this route, the only thing a party must present to be granted access to a protected resource is the token itself, and the token in question can be called a bearer token.\n\nIn practice, what you're doing can already be classified as bearer token -based. However, do consider you're not using bearer tokens as specified by the OAuth 2.0 related specs (see RFC 6750). That would imply relying on the Authorization HTTP header and using the Bearer authentication scheme.\n\nRegarding the use of the JWT to prevent CSRF: Without knowing exact details it's difficult to ascertain the validity of that practice. To be honest, it does not seem correct and/or worthwhile. The following article (Cookies vs Tokens: The Definitive Guide) may be a useful read on this subject, particularly the XSS and XSRF Protection section.\n\nOne final piece of advice. Even if you don't need to go full OAuth 2.0, I would strongly recommend on passing your access token within the Authorization header instead of going with custom headers. If they are really bearer tokens, follow the rules of RFC 6750. If not, you can always create a custom authentication scheme and still use that header."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A developer or software engineer specializing in web application development, specifically Single Page Applications (SPAs).
