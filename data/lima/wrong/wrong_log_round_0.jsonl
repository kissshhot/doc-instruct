{"conversations": ["Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20\u00b0C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.", "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp. Perparing food outside in the cold takes a lot longer than in a heated kitchen, severly limits what you can do, and may also risk predator encounters depending on what is around your area in the winter."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A young, adventurous, and environmentally conscious individual embarking on an unconventional living experiment in Stockholm.

{"conversations": ["How to respond to unsolicited advice?", "When someone gives you unsolicited advice, it can be tricky to know how to respond, no matter how well-intentioned it is. You don't want to hurt their feelings, but you also may not want to leave room for further advice. Sometimes, all you can do is politely acknowledge the advice and move forward. In other cases, however, you may need to shut the advice-giver down for crossing a boundary, or even leave the conversation.\n\n## Keep your cool\n\n1. Try to remember that the person is probably just trying to be helpful. They may not realize when they overstep their bounds, and they might hope that you will genuinely benefit from their advice. Sometimes, unsolicited advice just means that the person cares about you and wants to make your life easier. It is easy to take unsolicited advice as criticism. While this can be true, take their perspective into account and try to see if they are offering genuine, yet misguided support.\n2. Take a moment to put yourself in the other person's shoes. While it does not excuse their rude behavior, keep in mind that people often give unsolicited advice because they feel the need to be heard, or because it's what they're used to receiving from other people. Think about what may have led this person to share a piece of advice you did not need. Some examples of experiences that might lead someone to give unsolicited advice are feeling unheard while growing up, going through a difficult time and projecting their own problems onto you, or they feel undermined in other areas of their life and give advice to feel more competent. In other cases, the person may feel more powerful by giving advice that no one asked for, or they may be overconfident in their abilities. Gender is another factor, as men tend to give women more unsolicited advice, often as a result of undervaluing their skills.\n3. Maintain a sense of humor. It\u2019s often easiest to smile or laugh off unsolicited advice. By having a sense of humor about the situation, you can put yourself in the right frame of mind to shrug off the comment. For small, harmless suggestions, especially from strangers, put the situation in perspective and let your humor guide your response. Think about how the situation will make a funny story to tell your friends later, or how absurd it is for someone to think you might not know how to do a simple task. You can convey good-natured humor in your response out of politeness, even when you find the suggestion silly or ignorant. By saying something like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a great idea! Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d you may be enabling them to continue to offer unprompted advice, but it can help you avoid conflict.\n4. Avoid the impulse to lash out. It is easy to feel defensive when you receive unsolicited advice, in part because it can feel like the other person doesn\u2019t trust you to handle things themselves. Sarcasm and criticism can make the person who gave you advice feel victimized, however, as they most likely won\u2019t see what they did wrong. Think about your relationship with the person. Especially if they are a friend or family member, you may not want to upset them. When interacting with a stranger, it can be easy to be dismissive or rude, but try responding in a firm, yet polite way if laughing off the advice doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\n## Move on with the conversation\n\n1. Hear the advice-giver out. In many cases, the person just wants to feel heard or contribute to the conversation. Let them say their piece, even if it's unhelpful or completely wrong. They'll probably feel better once they finish talking and often just stop. Once they have finished, the conversation can move on.\n2. Acknowledge the advice and move on. Sometimes the easiest thing to do is nod, smile, say okay, and go ahead with your plans anyway. Particularly if the person is in a position of power, you might feel obligated to thank them before moving forward or changing the subject. \"Thank you. I'll consider that.\" \"Let me write that down so I can think it over.\" \"I already have a plan for handling this, but thank you for your perspective. I'll take it into consideration.\"\n3. Turn it into a joke about yourself. A little humor can turn around an awkward situation. If you think of something silly to say, try saying it out loud. The two of you might be able to have a good laugh and move on. \"If you think my desk is messy, you should see my bedroom. Some of my clothes have probably fossilized by now.\" \"You know me. I love carbs far too much to change my diet.\" \"I would, but my husband banned me from the kitchen after the second time I set myself on fire.\"\n4. Address their motive, if they have one. Sometimes people who give advice have an ulterior motive (for better or for worse). If you can tell that an advice-giver is hoping you'll do something that makes them happy, try offering an alternative or addressing it directly. \"Are you trying to make an excuse to spend more time with me? Because you don't need one! Are you free this weekend?\" \"I know that it's been a big change since I moved away from home. I enjoy living in the city, so I plan to stay there. Why don't we set some dates for you to come visit?\"\n5. Ask a question to switch to a new topic. Changing the subject by asking a question can be a good way to distract a person who was piling on advice. Try asking about them, or about something you know they're interested in. This way, they're likely to stay engaged in the new topic. \"I'll keep that in mind. But enough about me. How was your day?\" \"My partner and I are going to make all our birthing decisions together. Do you know of any good parent and me classes?\" \"Thanks for the advice! You mentioned having two dogs. What are their names?\"\n6. Turn down the advice politely if the person doesn't get the hint.. Try to keep it positive by saying that it isn't right for you personally, while acknowledging that it could be right for them or someone else. This will help the other person realize that they gave advice you didn\u2019t ask for. \"Thank you for trying to help, but I may have given the wrong impression. I'm not looking for advice right now.\" \"I've tried that, but I found that it doesn't help me personally.\" \"I'll make treatment decisions with my doctor.\" \"That's not in line with my personal values.\"\n\n\n## Confront the advice-giver\n\n1. Express your discomfort if the advice-giver crosses a line. Sometimes, people say things that are downright rude, mean, or overly familiar. In that case, you may want to tell them that they've offended you or hurt your feelings. Try to make \"I\" statements (e.g. \"I'm upset\") instead of a \"you\" statement (e.g. \"you're rude\") so that you don't put them on the defensive. One way to shut down a piece of unwanted advice would be to say, \"I feel upset about this line of conversation. Let's please change the subject.\"\n2. Set a boundary with a regular advice-giver. If someone is repeatedly trying to give advice when it's not what you want, you may want to express your frustration in a constructive way. You can set a boundary in the conversation, or in general, if the person has a track record of offering unsolicited advice. For a specific instance of needing to set a boundary you could say, \"I know you're trying to help, but I really just need a listening ear right now,\" or simply \"I'm not looking for advice at the moment.\" If someone has been giving you unsolicited advice for weeks, months, or years, try saying something like, \u201cI often feel like you try to help in ways that show you don\u2019t trust me to help myself,\u201d or \u201cI will ask for advice if I need to, but I need you to let me talk about this without trying to help.\u201d\n3. Exit the conversation if needed. Sometimes people pile on unsolicited advice despite your attempts to redirect the conversation or set a boundary. In these situations, it may be easier to leave the conversation for a minute or end the conversation altogether. \"Please excuse me. I remembered\u2026 \"\n\t* \"I need to get going now so I'm not late.\" \"I need to get to an appointment. It was nice talking to you!\"\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A professional seeking to improve their interpersonal skills and navigate workplace dynamics, particularly in situations where they receive unsolicited advice.

{"conversations": ["How to treat a hernia at home?", "## Reduce and manage pain\n\n1. Take over-the-counter pain meds to help relieve your discomfort. Aspirin and ibuprofen may work well to alleviate some pain and swelling. Follow the recommended dosage on the bottle and don\u2019t exceed the daily limit. If you find your pain doesn\u2019t get better or if you keep taking more and more medication, it may be time to call your doctor. If you take a blood thinner, always check with your doctor before using pain medication. They may want you to take something different so it doesn\u2019t interfere with the blood thinner. Types of Hernias: Almost all hernias will eventually need to be treated through surgery, especially if they\u2019re bulging or causing you a lot of pain. Some of the more common types of hernias include:\n\t* Inguinal hernia: This type of hernia is in the groin area; it most often affects men, though women can experience it, too. Femoral hernia: This hernia is located around the top of your inner thigh, caused by part of your intestines pushing through your groin. These are most common among older women. Hiatal hernia: This hernia appears on your abdomen as part of your stomach protrudes into your chest cavity. Umbilical hernia: This occurs when tissue pushes through your abdomen near your belly button. It can affect both infants and adults.\n2. Avoid heartburn-causing foods and large meals if you have a hiatal hernia. This is the one type of hernia that sometimes doesn\u2019t need surgery, especially if its symptoms can be managed through diet and over-the-counter antacids. If your symptoms increase over time, though, surgery may become the best solution.Enjoy multiple small meals throughout the day instead of 3 larger ones. This will put less pressure on your stomach so you\u2019re more comfortable all day long. Avoid caffeine, chocolate, garlic, tomatoes, and other fatty or fried foods that can cause heartburn. Don\u2019t lay down after you eat for several hours.\n3. Relieve discomfort from an inguinal hernia with a truss. A truss is a supportive undergarment that helps keep your hernia in place\u2014it\u2019s a temporary solution to help relieve pain until you can have surgery. You can buy a truss online, but it\u2019s best to visit your doctor so they can make sure it\u2019s properly fitted. Most inguinal hernias do need surgery to be repaired, but if your hernia is really small and not causing you pain, your doctor may be okay with waiting and keeping an eye on it. Surgery may sound scary, but these procedures usually take less than an hour and should quickly help relieve your pain.\n4. Eat a fiber-rich diet to make bowel movements softer and easier to pass. Straining your muscles can aggravate your hernia, and constipation can make things worse. Add lots of fruits and vegetables to your daily diet, and consider taking a fiber supplement to help things move smoothly.Oatmeal, nuts, beans, popcorn, chia seeds, and whole grains are also great high-fiber food choices.\n5. Lose weight to take pressure off of your abdomen. This can be helpful for all types of hernias; the less weight you\u2019re carrying around, the less strain your muscles will be under. Try modifying your diet by eating leaner proteins and more fruits and vegetables, and try adding in some gentle exercise every day to lose weight.Hernias can be really uncomfortable and it may be hard for you to imagine exercising. Try going for short 15-minute walks when you can, or go to the pool and slowly swim laps. Be gentle on yourself, though, so you don\u2019t aggravate the hernia more.\n\n\n## Prevent further damage\n\n1. Avoid lifting bulky or heavy objects that may strain your muscles. Instead of bending over at the waist to pick up heavy items, bend your knees so you\u2019re squatting. Bring the object close to you and then straighten your legs and stand up. Keep the heavy object at chest level and try not to twist and turn too much.For heavy items you can\u2019t lift yourself, consider using a dolly. You wedge the bottom of the dolly under the item, then use your weight to pull on the dolly\u2019s handle to lift the object. From there, you can wheel it wherever it needs to go.\n2. Relax while going to the bathroom so you don\u2019t strain your groin area. This is a little counterintuitive, but try to not strain when you have a bowel movement. Take your time and don\u2019t push too hard; instead, let your body slowly work things out\u2014it may take longer than usual, but it\u2019s gentler on your body and can prevent further damage.A high-fiber diet can help prevent hernias as well as manage discomfort if you already have one. Putting your feet up on a short stool may also make those muscles relax and help you go to the bathroom more easily. Add a hot cup of coffee to your morning routine. The heat and caffeine can help things get moving.\n3. Strengthen your abdominal muscles to prevent additional hernias. Weak muscles make it easier for your internal organs to break through your abdominal walls. The key to strengthening your core is to do so gently\u2014too much pressure or exertion could actually cause a hernia, so start slow and stop any exercises that cause you pain. Try doing 3 sets of 10 mini crunches every day. Lay on your back with your knees bent and put your hands behind your head. Use your ab muscles to bring your shoulders up off the ground 3 to 4 inches (76 to 102 mm) before carefully lowering yourself back to the ground. Workout at the pool for low-resistance strength training. The support of the water will make it easier for you to exercise without having to strain your abdominals as much. Start slow if you\u2019re new to swimming or doing water exercises, and enjoy your time in the water! Take a beginner\u2019s yoga class to gently stretch and tone your core.\n4. Quit smoking to improve lung health and eliminate excessive coughing. There are lots of reasons to quit smoking, and doing so can also help prevent hernias. Chronic coughing strains your muscles in both your abdomen and groin, so start curbing your smoking habit or quit cold turkey. It can be extremely hard to stop smoking. If you\u2019re having a hard time, talk to your doctor. They may be able to provide you with some kind of aid to help make the transition easier.\n\n\n## Seek medical care\n\n1. See your doctor for an official diagnosis before treating yourself. You will likely recognize the signs and symptoms of a hernia on your own, especially if it\u2019s large. However, it\u2019s easy to misdiagnose yourself, so see your doctor to make sure what you have is a hernia. Your doctor will make a proper diagnosis so you can be sure you\u2019re getting the right treatment.Your doctor will do a physical examination to check for a hernia. They\u2019ll look at the area and may press into it with their hands. In some cases, your doctor may do imaging tests to view the hernia.\n2. Talk with your child\u2019s pediatrician if they develop an umbilical hernia. For infants and children under 5, always check with your pediatrician to see what they recommend. Many times, an infant\u2019s hernia will close all on its own over time, but if it hasn\u2019t gone away by the time your child is 5 years old, they may need a small procedure to have it fixed.Umbilical hernias are common with infants, and they usually don\u2019t cause your child any pain or discomfort.\n3. Let your doctor know if you have a hernia while you\u2019re pregnant. Because of the extra strain on your body, hernias are fairly common among pregnant women. If you suspect you have a hernia, talk to your doctor so they can check it out. Your doctor will most likely want to wait until after birth and recovery before treating the hernia if you need surgery, but you and your baby should be safe in the meantime.As much as you can, avoid heavy lifting and make sure to eat a high-fiber diet to prevent constipation.\n4. Visit your doctor as soon as possible if your hernia looks dark red or purple. This can be a sign that your hernia is strangulated. When this happens, your hernia is cutting off the blood flow to part of your intestine and requires medical treatment. Go to the doctor to make sure you\u2019re okay because you may need emergency treatment.Try your best to not worry or panic\u2014your doctor will be able to fix your hernia.\n5. Seek emergency care if you have pain, nausea, vomiting, or blocked bowels. Sometimes a hernia can block off part of your intestines. This means your bowel movements can get caught behind the hernia, causing pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloating. You will likely not be able to pass gas or have a bowel movement. See your doctor or go to the emergency room if this happens because you likely need medical treatment.This is a treatable condition, though it can be really scary at the moment. As soon as you suspect a problem, get medical attention so you can get back to normal as soon as possible.\n6. Have a surgical procedure done to correct your hernia and prevent future ones. These procedures are generally pretty quick and you should get to go home that same day. The surgeon will usually make a small incision near the hernia and push it back into place. From there, they will sew and reinforce the tear so that the hernia will be less likely to protrude again.Make sure to follow all recovery instructions after your surgery. You\u2019ll need to take it easy and avoid heavy lifting for a while, and you\u2019ll probably also have pain medication to take.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A cybersecurity professional or IT manager working in the healthcare sector.

{"conversations": ["You are asleep on your boat on open sea. When you wake up you discover you have been robbed. A quick inspection of security cam footage reveals that the pirates who robbed you left your ship exactly an hour ago. The sea is flat, extends indefinitely, and is fully covered in a thick persistent fog. You have no idea in which direction the pirates fled. But you do know that these pirates always continue in a straight line at full speed away from their victim. Their maximum speed on open water is 20 nautical miles per hour. Your boat can reach 21 nautical miles per hour. \nHow do you catch the pirates?", "If we assume the ocean is flat and extends indefinitely in all directions, there is a strategy that guarantees we can catch the pirates in at most 800,000 years.\n\nPut our current location as the origin of a coordinate system. We will describe our position in polar coordinates, as a function of time: $(r(t),\\theta(t))$ (where we have arbitrarily chosen a direction to be $\\theta=0$, and $t=0$ is when we realized we had been robbed).\n\nWe begin by traveling in the $\\theta=0$ direction for 20 hours, putting our position at $(420, 0)$. We are then the same distance from the origin as the pirates. Next, we will travel in a spiral, in a manner so that $r'(t)=20$ at all times. This guarantees we will always be the same distance from the origin as the pirates. For $t\\geq 20$, we will have $r(t)=420+20(t-20)=20t+20$.\n\nOur speed is\n$$\n\\sqrt{(r')^2+r^2(\\theta')^2} = 21\\text{ mph},\n$$\nand $r'(t)=20$ for $t>20$, so\n$$\n\\theta'(t)=\\sqrt{\\frac{41}{r^2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{20+20t}.\n$$\nIf there is a $t\\geq 20$ for which $\\theta(t)$ is the angle in which the pirates fled, we will catch them. This means we will certainly catch the pirates by the time $\\theta$ has increased from $0$ to $2\\pi$. If $t_0$ is the time this happens, we have\n$$\n2\\pi=\\int_{20}^{t_0}\\theta'(t)\\,dt=\\int_{20}^{t_0}\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{20+20t}dt.\n$$\nSolving for $t_0$ gives\n$$\nt_0=21\\mathrm{exp}\\left(\\frac{40\\pi}{\\sqrt{41}}\\right)-1\\approx 7,005,043,026.\n$$\nThis means we can catch the pirates in at most 7,005,043,026 hours, or about 800 millennia.

{"conversations": ["How to core apples?", "Instead of buying pre-sliced apples, take advantage of whole ones while they are fresh. Whether you're baking apples or slicing one up for a snack, removing the inedible core isn't as hard as it looks. Use a paring knife or an apple corer to keep apples whole. For apples you need to cut first, scoop the core out with a melon baller. If you're looking for a quick way to prepare apples for cooking, peel them and slice off useable parts. Then, enjoy cleaned apples as is or use them as a component in another recipe.\n\n## Core whole apples with a knife\n\n1. Set the apple on a cutting board with the stem side up. Keep the cutting board on a flat, stable surface. Make sure it can't slide around while you're coring the apple. Since you're going to be using a knife, it's easy to slip and nick your fingers if you're not careful. Try putting something underneath the cutting board to help hold it in place. A damp towel or paper towel works well in a pinch when dealing with wobbly cutting boards. There are also non-stick cutting board mats you can get online and at kitchen supply stores.\n2. Poke the tip of a paring knife into the top of the apple. While holding the apple steady, push the knife into it about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from its stem. You are aiming for the spot where the core ends. Cutting any closer to the stem could puncture the core and leave you with more of a mess to clean up later. If you don't have a paring knife handy, another thin blade will do. Choose the thinnest one you have in order to limit damage to the apple's flesh while you go after the core.\n3. Push the blade all the way through the apple. Hold the knife steady as you push it straight down so it doesn't cut into the core. Watch out for the sharp tip of the knife coming through the bottom's end! Tip the apple over on its side for a moment so you are able to see where the knife emerges. Coring is easiest with a knife that is longer than the apple. That way, you can remove the entire core in one go. If you don't have a knife like that, stick with a paring knife and scrape away any parts of the core left behind after the initial cut.\n4. Cut all the way around the core to separate it from the apple. Hold the apple steady and carefully cut in a circle without slicing into the core. Keep the blade \u20444 in (0.64 cm) from the stem the entire time. This can be a little tricky to do at first, but it becomes much easier with practice. It leaves the core loose inside the apple, making it easy to remove by hand. If you're having trouble keeping the cut consistent all the way around the stem, try making more incisions. Place the knife on another side of the stem and push it all the way through the bottom again. Do this 4 times on all sides of the stem, then cut in a circle to connect the incisions.\n5. Remove the knife and push out the core with your thumbs. Raise the knife slowly so you don't lose control of it. Set it aside, then give the stem a good, hard push. The core will pop out through the bottom of the apple. If it is stuck, cut around the core again to separate it from the rest of the apple. Another option is to use the tip of the knife to pry the core up toward you. Once you are able to get a firm grip on it, pull it up to remove it. Knife control is important when doing this, so raise it with patience rather than yanking it toward you.\n6. Cut around the inside of the apple if you notice any seeds remaining. Sometimes these parts break off the core and get left behind. Put the knife back in the hole and scrape around the outside edge. Push the inedible bits out through the holes in the apple to throw them away. Once you're sure you got all of the black seeds and stringy bits of the core, you're ready to cook the apple.You could also use a melon baller to scoop out the insides. Twist the melon baller around to clear out the cut, leaving it clean and consistent.\n\n\n## Use an apple corer\n\n1. Place the apple on a flat surface with the stem face up. Set it up on something stable and damage-resistant like a cutting board. Coring tools are pretty sharp, so don't sacrifice your countertop for the sake of an apple core. Make sure you have plenty of room to hold the apple steady while coring it. Test the cutting board or surface by attempting to move or shake it. If it seems unsteady, expect it to move at the worst time. Try putting a wet towel or a non-slip mat underneath a cutting board to steady it.\n2. Place the apple corer on the center of the apple. If you have a tube-shaped corer, position it so the apple's stem is in the middle of the tube. Push the corer down until it begins cutting into the apple. If you have a combination corer and peeler, position it \u20444 in (0.64 cm) from the core with the serrated edge facing inward. Push the tip down into the apple to begin separating its flesh from the core. The easiest type of corer to use is one with a long handle and a circular tube with a serrated bottom edge. The tube fits over the core, holding it together while you pull it out. When using the vegetable peeler type of corer, you have to twist the blade around in a circle to cut out the core. The motion is the same as when using a tube-shaped corer, but it takes a little more work to rotate the corer by hand. You could also use a flat, ring-shaped corer. This type slices up the apple while removing the core. It's great for cutting an apple into wedges with one fell swoop.\n3. Twist the corer as you push it toward the bottom of the apple. This takes a little bit of force, so keep a firm grip on both the apple and the handle of the corer. Rotate the corer back and forth while pushing down on it. As long as you keep the apple still, the corer will go straight down toward the opposite end of the core. If you're using the blade-type corer, push it down into the apple and begin rotating it around the core. It will separate the core from the rest of the apple.\n4. Pull the corer out to remove the center membrane and seeds. What happens next depends on what kind of corer you have. With many tube-shaped corers, all you have to do is pull the handle back to take the core out with it. For blade-like corers, lift the blade out and then push the core out with your fingers. Check the inside of the apple for leftover seeds. Corers are better at cleaning out an apple than knives, but a loose seed or core fragment can fall out of the tool and get left behind.\n\n\n## Scoop the core out of a halve apple\n\n1. Set the apple on a stable cutting surface. Use a cutting board to prevent your countertop from getting damaged. Start by standing the apple up on the board with the stem face up. Make sure the cutting board can't move at all while you're working. Stabilize the cutting board by placing a towel or mat underneath it if needed.\n2. Cut the apple in half to expose the core. Use a sharp knife to split the apple. Hold it steady and cut vertically through it to the bottom. Try to slice through the center in a single, clean motion. You will end up going straight through the core, but that is okay. If you wish to quarter the apple, you could turn the halves over onto their cut sides. Slice them top to bottom down the middle. Whether you do this before or after removing the core doesn't make much of a difference.\n3. Scoop out the core using a spoon or melon baller. Keep the apple halves flat against the cutting board with the skin side down. This will give you a clear view of the seeds and the fibrous sheaths in the center of each slice. They are pretty easy to remove by digging into the apple's flesh right where it meets the hard, stringy core. Clean out both halves to leave the juicy part of the apple intact. If you quartered the apples, an alternative way to remove the core is by cutting underneath it. Use a paring knife to cut diagonally down to the center point underneath the core. Turn the apple slice around and cut from the other side to cleanly lift away the core.\n4. Slice away the stem and bud on each half with a paring knife. Keep the apple halves skin side down on the cutting board. The stem and bud are on the ends of each half, right above the removed center. Hold your knife parallel to these parts and cut diagonally down underneath them. Slice diagonally down from the opposite side to complete the cut and remove the inedible parts. There are pieces of the stem and bud on both halves, so remember to get them all. You will need to make a total of 4 cuts on each half, 2 apiece for each stem and bud. Another way to do this is by scooping out the stem and bud with a melon baller or spoon. It is less precise than cutting, so it takes away more of the juicy flesh.\n\n\n## Separate the core from a peel apple\n\n1. Peel the apple using a paring knife or vegetable peeler. If you have a good vegetable peeler handy, use it for an easy way to remove the apple's skin. Drag it from the top of the apple to the bottom to remove a layer of skin. After setting aside the peel, rotate the apple and use the peeler again and again to expose the juicy flesh.If you're using a knife, slip the tip of the blade underneath the skin. Peel from side to side across the apple, moving slowly to keep the blade as close to the skin as possible. Although using a knife gets easier with practice, you could slip and cut into the good part of the apple if you're not careful.\n2. Set the apple down on a flat surface with the stem side up. Stand the apple on a safe, stable cutting board. Make sure the board won't slide out of place while you attempt to cut the apple. As long as the board is secure, cutting the stem out is a quick and safe process.For your own safety and the sake of the apple, slip a damp towel or non-stick mat underneath a cutting board to prevent it from moving while you work.\n3. Slice across the apple to separate part of it from the stem. Pick up a sharp chef's knife and position it about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from the stem. Hold onto the apple with your other hand to stop it from moving. When you're ready, slice straight down, all the way to the bottom of the apple. This will separate part of the apple, leaving the core untouched and standing on your cutting board.Cut as close to the stem as you can to save the edible portions of the apple. If you cut too close to the stem, you might end up taking out some of the core. Cut the hard, stringy core chunks off the apple slices before using them.\n4. Turn the apple and cut away the other sides to remove the core. Rotate the apple so an uncut side faces you. Cut across it again and then all the way down to the bottom. Keep the knife \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from the stem at all times so all the cut parts are even. When you're done, you will have 4 apple chunks that are clean and easy to slice up into whatever size you need.For example, lay the portions flat on the cutting board and cut them from top to bottom to create slices. Cut the slices from side to side to create smaller apple chunks.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An individual who is new to cooking or baking and is looking for a simple, step-by-step guide on how to prepare apples for recipes that require the apple core to be removed.

Re-write mythology.", "Long before the days of the War of the Gods, Titans reigned over the face of the Earth.  As with any rulers, there were some who ruled fairly and others who did not. Among the more benevolent leaders was Hyperion, the Lord of Light. He was called upon for wisdom and discernment; mortals valued his insight and praised his control of the heavenly bodies.\nYet Hyperion had one great love: Theia, his consort. She was a Titaness of radiance, a mother goddess who shone like the sun on all who sought after her. The two Titans were very much in love, and their love gave vibrancy to the life around them. They were happy - for a time.\nThat time ended when the Gods declared war on the Titans, with Zeus at the forefront of battle. Cronus, Hyperion's brother and Lord over all the Titans, called Hyperion into battle against the upstart Gods. Knowing the war would end in defeat, Hyperion left anyway, answering the call of his brother and king.\nBut before he left, Hyperion gave Theia a gift: a ring of radiant light to wear around her finger. He told her that the ring would tell her if he was safe; that the ring would glow with a silver light when he was in danger. Theia took it gratefully and bid her lover farewell. It was the last time she would see him.\nHyperion fell during the war and was banished with the other Titans to the pits of Tartarus. During the battle, Theia watched in helpless anguish as the ring shone brighter and brighter until it was nearly as luminous as the sun. In her despair, she removed the ring and prayed to the Mother Gaia that she would cause the ring to grow as large as her love for Hyperion. Gaia listened, and so the ring grew.\nNow the ring encircles the Earth, a strip of radiance that gives off silver moonlight every evening.

{"conversations": ["I am a professor of computer science. Help me write an academic research proposal to fund my NLP lab. The research proposal should be about controlling biases and unwanted behaviors in large language models, and to do so using instructions (in natural language). Let's start by drafting an abstract and an introduction.", "Here is the abstract and introduction of a research proposal about controlling biases and unwanted behaviors in large language models:\n\n\n#Controlling Biases in Large Language Models\n\n\n##Abstract\n\nWhile large language models are unlocking previously unimaginable applications, their extensive usage also exacerbates the risk of generating toxic text that amplifies adverse biases in the training data. We propose utilizing the newfound instruction understanding abilities of large language models to identify, explain, and mitigate undesirable biases in text. Our research plan begins with a novel method for eliciting natural language explanations of why a particular text is harmful, without any training data or definition of what constitutes toxic text. We then propose to investigate whether explicitly instructing models to avoid biases using natural language prompts can steer them away from unwanted outputs. Finally, we aim to explore a more permanent solution by fine-tuning the model on anti-harm instructions (behavioral guidelines, codes of conduct, diversity training), and thus informing it on which utterances should be avoided. Successfully tuning large language models to better align with acceptable behavior will dramatically advance the ability to deploy safer, fairer models in real-world settings.\n\n\n##Introduction\n\nLanguage models, the cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP), are known to reflect and even amplify biases in training corpora, often resulting in racist, sexist, and generally toxic outputs. Susceptibility to such harmful biases hinders the deployment of these models and limits their applicability.\n\nA common approach for developing safer models is to try to control the training corpora. [Citations], for example, used a list of banned words to filter potentially harmful text from the C4 corpus. This simple approach fails to remove all adverse biases from the text, as toxic content can be written using words that are, by themselves, benign. Another technique for corpus intervention is data augmentation [Citations], which adds a counterfactual example for each utterance of a potentially biased text. This technique, however, only applies when counterfactual swaps are possible, e.g. gender, and it requires prior knowledge of all potential biases in the training corpus. Data augmentation enlarges an already oversized corpus, and can often create artificial and even unrealistic texts if not done carefully. Finally, various approaches perform post-training debiasing [Citations], but these often result in significant performance degradation on downstream tasks.\n\nWe propose explaining and mitigating adverse biases via natural language instructions. Our plan includes three parts:\n*  Inducing natural language explanations of adverse biases in a given text. We intend to build on our recent work on instruction induction [Citations], and prompt language models to describe \u201cin their own words\u201d whether a given text is problematic and why.\n*  Controlling the manifestation of model biases during generation by prompting language models with explicit instructions. We plan to investigate the use of both model-generated explanations and existing guidelines written for humans (e.g. code of conduct) to reduce and control adverse biases during inference.\n*  Mitigating adverse biases in the model itself by fine-tuning on behavioral guidelines. The goal is to efficiently adapt the model itself so that it (permanently) generates less harmful content. We build on recent work which shows that fine-tuning on task instructions (instruction tuning) improves the zero-shot learning abilities of language models [Citations]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has utilized this framework for teaching models what behaviors should be avoided. The success of instruction tuning suggests that our approach is viable, and we hope it can accelerate the progress towards safer, fairer models."], "source": "authors", "questioner": "A computer science professor with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Which is it really?", "strong/weak can be thought of in relation to how the compiler, if applicable, handles typing.\n\n* Weakly typed means the compiler, if applicable, doesn't enforce correct typing.  Without implicit compiler interjection, the instruction will error during run-time.\n```\"12345\" * 1 === 12345  // string * number => number\n```\nStrongly typed means there is a compiler, and it wants you an explicit cast from string to integer.\n```(int) \"12345\" * 1 === 12345\n```\nIn either case, some compiler's features can implicitly alter the instruction during compile-time to do conversions for you, if it can determine that is the right thing to do.\nThus far, JavaScript can be categorized as Not-Strongly-Typed.  That either means it's weakly-typed or un-typed.\n\ndynamic/static can be thought of in relation to how the language instructions manipulate types.\n\n* Dynamically typed means the value's type is enforced, but the variable simply represents any value of any type.\n```x = 12345;    // number\nx = \"string\"; // string\nx = { key: \"value\" }; // object\ny = 123 + x; // error or implicit conversion must take place.\n```\nStatically typed means the variable type is strongly enforced, and the value type is less-so enforced.\n```int x = 12345; // binds x to the type int\nx = \"string\";  // too late, x is an integer - error\nstring y = 123; // error or implicit conversion must take place.\n```\nThus far, JavaScript can be categorized as Not-Statically-Typed.  Also, it appears to be Dynamically Typed, if typed at all.  So we need to see what Typing means.\n\nTyped means that the language distinguishes between different types such as string, number, boolean, object, array, null, undefined and so on. Also each operation is bound to specific types. So you cannot divide an integer by a string.\n```    2 / \"blah\"  // produces NaN\n```\nUntyped means the operation of dividing integer by string would result in treating the first four bytes of string as integer.  This is because Untyped operations take place directly on bits, there are no types to observe.  The outcome will be something quite unexpected:\n```    2 / \"blah\"  // will be treated as  2 / 1500275048\n```\nSince JavaScript behaves according to the definition of being Typed, it must be.  And therefore it must be Dynamically Typed, and Weakly Typed.\nIf anybody claims JavaScript is Untyped, it is merely for academic theory, not for practical application."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A software developer or computer science student with a strong interest in programming languages, particularly JavaScript.

Dupire equation implies that there exits an unique continuous function $\\sigma_{loc}$ defined by\n$$\\sigma_{loc}^{2}(K,T)=\\frac{\\partial_{T}C(K,T)+rK\\partial_{K}C(K,T)}{\\frac{1}{2}K^{2}\\partial_{KK}C(K,T)}$$ for all $(K,T)\\in(0,\\infty)\\times(0,\\infty)$ such that the solution to the stochastic differential equation $dS_{t}/S_{t}=rdt+\\sigma(t,S_{t})dW_{t}$ exactly generates the European call option prices.\nWhat do the dynamics of the local volatility mean? Are dynamics equivalent to the volatility surface? Why the dynamics of local volatility model is highly unrealistic?", "A general model (with continuous paths) can be written\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r_t dt + \\sigma_t dW_t^S\n$$\nwhere the short rate $r_t$ and spot volatility $\\sigma_t$ are stochastic processes. \nIn the Black-Scholes model both $r$ and $\\sigma$ are deterministic functions of time (even constant in the original model). This produces a flat smile for any expiry $T$. And we have the closed form formula for option prices\n$$\n  C(t,S;T,K) = BS(S,T-t,K;\\Sigma(T,K))\n$$\nwhere $BS$ is the BS formula and $\\Sigma(T,K) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T-t}\\int_t^T \\sigma(s)^2 ds}$. This is not consistent with the smile observed on the market. In order to match market prices, one needs to use a different volatility for each expiry and strike. This is the implied volatility surface $(T,K) \\mapsto \\Sigma(T,K)$. \nIn the local volatility model, rates are deterministic, instant volatility is stochastic but there is only one source of randomness\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r(t) dt + \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) dW_t^S\n$$\nthis is a special case of the general model with\n$$\n  d\\sigma_t = (\\partial_t \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + r(t)S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + \\frac{1}{2}S_t^2\\partial_S^2\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)) dt + \\frac{1}{2}S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)^2 dW_t^S\n$$\nWhat is appealing with this model is that the function $\\sigma_{Dup}$ can be perfectly calibrated to match all market vanilla prices (and quite easily too). \nThe problem is that while correlated to the spot, statistical study show that the volatility also has its own source of randomness independent of that of the spot. Mathematically, this means the instant correlation between the spot and vol is not 1 contrary to what happens in the local volatility model. \nThis can be seen in several ways:\n\n1. The forward smile. Forward implied volatility is implied from prices of forward start options: ignoring interest rates,\n$$\n  C(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K) := E^Q[(\\frac{S_{T+\\theta}}{S_{T}}-K)_+] =: C_{BS}(S=1,\\theta,K;\\Sigma(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K))\n$$\nAlternatively, it is sometimes defined as the expectation of implied volatility at a forward date. In a LV model, as the maturity $T$ increases but $\\theta$ is kept constant, the forward smile gets flatter and higher. This is not what we observe in the markets where the forward smile tends to be similar to the current smile.\n\nThis is because the initial smile you calibrate the model too has decreasing skew:\n$$\n\\partial_K \\Sigma(0,S;T,K) \\xrightarrow[T\\to +\\infty]{} 0\n$$ \n\n2. Smile rolling. In a LV model, smile tends to move in the opposite direction of the spot and get higher independently of the direction of the spot.\nThis is not consistent with what is observed on markets. See Hagan and al. Managing Smile Risk for the derivation. This means that\n$\\partial_S \\Sigma_{LV}(t,S;T,K)$ often has the wrong sign so your Delta will be wrong which can lead to a higher hedging error than using BS. \n3. Barrier options. In FX markets, barrier options like Double No Touch are liquid but a LV model calibrated to vanilla prices does not reproduce these prices. This is a consequence of the previous point.   \n\nThe LV model is a static model. Its whole dynamic comes from the volatility surface at time 0. But the vol surface has a dynamic that is richer than that.\nThere are alternatives using multiple factors like SV models, LSV models (parametric local vol like SABR or fully non parametric local vol), models of the joint dynamic of the spot and vol surface etc... but the LV model remains the default model in many cases due to its simplicity, its ability to calibrate the initial smile perfectly and its numerical efficiency.

{"conversations": ["How to clean plant leaves?", "Clean plants are a beautiful addition to your home and garden, and do a wonderful job of purifying the air. Choose a cleaning method that is safe for your plant, especially if your plant is sensitive to water. Experiment with different shine agents to add a beautiful glow to your plant leaves. Each of these strategies will leave your plants looking clean and shiny.\n\n## Remove dust and grime\n\n1. Wipe large, shiny leaves with a damp cloth. This is the best way to clean large plants, such as rubber plants, that are difficult to move. Dunk your cloth in water and then squeeze out any excess liquid. Gently wipe both sides of all of the leaves to remove any dust and grime. Microfiber cloths or cheesecloths work well for cleaning plants. Clean the leaves each time that you notice dust or dirt building up. This works well for both indoor and outdoor plants such as Gunnera, Plantain Lillies, and Elephant Ears. Place a drop of dishwashing liquid on the cloth if you notice insects eating or landing on your plant.\n2. Use a soft paintbrush to remove dust from plants with fuzzy leaves. Plants with fluffy leaves, such as African Violets, are quite delicate and shouldn\u2019t be wiped. Instead, gently brush any dust or insects off the leaves with a clean, soft paintbrush. If you don\u2019t have a soft paintbrush on-hand, use a pipe cleaner or soft toothbrush instead. Avoid wetting the leaves of fuzzy plants, as this can cause water spots to appear.\n3. Rinse indoor plant leaves with warm water to remove insects and dust. Place your indoor plant in the sink or shower and use the pressure of the water stream to remove any dust and dirt from the plant. The mist from the shower will also help to hydrate the plant\u2019s leaves. Leave the plants to drip-dry and then take them outside to dry in the sunshine. Always use warm water, as cold water can leave spots on the leaves. Don\u2019t wash plants, such as cacti and African Violets, that are sensitive to water. This method works well for Peace Lilies, Sword Ferns, and Devils Ivy.\n4. Dunk small plants into water to quickly get rid of dust. Place your hand over the soil to keep it in place and then turn the plant upside down and submerge the plant in room temperature water. This is a great option for small houseplants and outdoor plants. Allow the plants to drip-dry out of direct light.\n5. Spray compressed air onto cacti to avoid getting them wet. Cacti are used to desert conditions and will often wilt and die if they are over-watered. Spray air from an air compressor can over the spikes to dislodge any dust or dirt from the cacti. Hold the can 10 centimetres (3.9 in) away from the cacti to avoid damaging the spikes. Purchase an air-compressor can from a hardware store or a plant nursery. This works well for both spiky and smooth cacti.\n\n\n## Add shine\n\n1. Rub a thin coat of mayonnaise over the leaves to keep them shiny. Squeeze a little mayonnaise onto a paper towel and wipe it over the leaves. Cover the entire leave with a light enough coat that it cannot be seen. Remove any excess mayonnaise with a clean paper towel. This shiny coating will last for approximately 2 weeks. Simply reapply the mayonnaise to restore the shine of the leaves. This method works for all types of plants.\n2. Cover the leaves in a thin layer of mineral oil for a long-lasting glow. Mineral oil provides a shiny coating for the leaves and helps to prevent dust from accumulating quickly. Simply place a drop of mineral oil onto each leaf and use your fingers to evenly spread it over the top side of the leaf. Use this method on any type of plant. Avoid using coconut or olive oil on the leaves, as this can block the pores of the plant. Keep plants with mineral oil on them out of the direct sun to avoid the leaves from getting burnt. Reapply the mineral oil once or twice per year.\n3. Spray a commercial plant shining product onto the leaves to add sheen. These sprays are specially formulated to keep your plant leaves looking shiny. Liberally spray the product over all the leaves on your plants. If you are spraying outdoor plants, choose a product that is designed for outdoor plants. Purchase a plant shining spray from a plant store. Follow the application instructions on the packet. This is a great option for cacti, as you don\u2019t have to touch the plant.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A plant enthusiast, gardener, or homeowner who is interested in maintaining a clean and healthy garden.

{"conversations": ["How to boost your diet with peanut butter powder?", "Powdered peanut butter is a versatile ingredient that you can use to add some nutty flavor to any dish. Its low caloric count and limited fat content make it an appealing option for those looking to lose a little weight. It is great for supplementing simple dishes like smoothies or oatmeal. You can also use it to make savory sauces, spreads, or peanut-flavored dishes. Finally, you can mix the powder into any baked good, from brownies to cupcakes and cookies, to add some peanut flavor.\n\n## Enhance your diet\n\n1. Reduce your caloric intake. The main appeal of peanut butter powder is its low calorie count. A tablespoon of powdered peanut butter has about 25 calories compared to the 96 calories in the same amount of regular peanut butter. It is a good option for those looking to lose some weight but still enjoy peanut flavor.\n2. Limit your fat intake. Another appealing feature of powdered peanut butter is its low fat content. 1 tablespoon contains less than 1 gram (0.035 oz) of fat, while the same amount of regular peanut butter has about 8 grams (0.3 oz) of fat. Note that the fat content of peanuts is mostly heart-healthy monounsaturated fats. A single serving of peanut butter powder is 2 tablespoons. One serving contains about 1.5 grams of fat.\n3. Add a little protein or fiber. Powdered peanut butter is great for adding protein and fiber nutrients without adding the extra fat \u2014 1 tablespoon offers 3 to 4 grams (0.11 to 0.14 oz) of protein and 1 gram (0.035 oz) of fiber. This is particularly important for things like baking where the extra fat can alter the finished product.\n\n\n## Supplement simple dish\n\n1. Add it to your smoothies. To add peanut flavor while limiting calories and fat, you can add a tablespoon or two of the powder to your favorite smoothie. For most recipes, about 2 tablespoons (12.28 g) of powder can substitute for 1 tablespoon (16 g) of traditional peanut butter. Besides its lower calorie count, powdered peanut butter also makes your smoothies smoother and less gritty. As a rule of thumb, add 1 tablespoon (6.14 g) of powdered peanut butter for every 1 cup (250 ml) of smoothie or shake\n2. Mix it into your oatmeal. Instead of adding a regular peanut butter, mix in a spoonful of powdered peanut butter to your bowl of oatmeal. You can stir it with the oats before you add your milk or water, or you can mix it in after your oats are cooked. Pair it with a banana, some dark chocolate, or some berries for a PB&J oatmeal. You can also add peanut butter powder to muesli, quinoa, and other grain-based dishes.\n3. Pour some into your yogurt or granola. If you are making a parfait, you can mix powdered peanut butter into the either the granola or the yogurt. To add some extra flavor to your yogurt, mix in a spoonful of the powder. You can also sprinkle on top of the granola. If you are making your own granola, you can mix in powdered peanut butter for some additional flavor.\n\n\n## Cook with peanut butter powder\n\n1. Use it to make a peanut sauce. You can add powdered peanut butter to any sauce recipe that calls for peanut butter. Simply rehydrate the powder by mixing it with water and then add it to your sauce. Be sure to follow the directions to get the correct amount of peanut powder for the sauce. As a rule of thumb, mixing 4 tablespoons (24.56 g) of peanut butter powder with 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) of water will give you 2 tablespoons (32 g) of rehydrated peanut butter.\n2. Add it to breading. To add some extra flavor to your breaded meats, try mixing some powdered peanut butter into your breading. Use your traditional breading recipe and simply mix in about 1/3 as much peanut butter powder as flour our breadcrumbs. You could try this breading on chicken cutlets or pork chops. Consider adding crushed red pepper flakes to the breading for a little extra spice.\n3. Get creative. You can use powdered peanut butter to add some extra flavor to snacks like popcorn or trail mixes. You can also sprinkle it on top of bananas, mix it with your cereal, or add it to pancake batter. If you think that a dish might benefit from some peanut flavor, give it a dash of powdered peanut butter. For example, with a little olive oil and a couple spoonfuls of powdered peanut butter, you can make peanut butter popcorn. For a sweeter treat, consider sprinkling peanut butter powder on top of kettle corn.\n\n\n## Add peanut butter powder to desserts\n\n1. Bake it into baked goods. If you want to give your desserts a little extra peanut flavor, consider adding some peanut butter powder. You can add it to any baked good by substituting peanut butter powder for 1/3 the amount of flour called for in the recipe. In addition, you can mix in a couple of tablespoons of the powder to any batter. If a recipe calls for 3 cups (375 g) of flour, use 1 cup (294.7 grams) of peanut butter powder and 2 cups (250 g) of flour. If you are making banana muffins, you might add 3 tablespoons (18.42 g) of peanut butter powder to the batter.\n2. Go gluten-free. If you have a gluten intolerance or suffer from celiac disease, you can use peanut butter powder to make a number of desserts that do not require flour. You can make gluten free peanut butter brownies. You can also make gluten-free peanut butter cookies in a matter of minutes.\n3. Make a peanut butter spread. You can make a peanut butter spread in no time using a little peanut butter powder and cream cheese. Simply mix 1 tablespoon (6.14 g) of powder with an 8-ounce (226.8 g) block of cream cheese. If the spread does not have the peanut flavor you want, add sprinkles of the powder and mix until it tastes the way you would like.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A health-conscious individual who is interested in finding alternative ways to incorporate protein and nutrients into their diet, specifically through innovative food products.

Contrary to popular belief (and outward appearance, from a human perspective), Elves do age; and as they get older, they get less interested in procreation.\n* Having children is exhausting. The Elves believe that their child-bearing process draws a heavier physical and spiritual toll on them, compared to what it does to humans. They're understandable reluctant to have a lot of kids, because what's the point in having a dozen kids if doing so might literally kill you?\n\nFrom &quot;Laws and Customs&quot;:\n\nIt might be thought that, since the Eldar do not (as Men deem) grow old in body, they may bring forth children at any time in the ages of their lives. But this is not so. For the Eldar do indeed grow older, even if slowly: the limit of their lives is the life of Arda, which though long beyond the reckoning of Men is not endless, and ages also. Moreover their body and spirit are not separated but coherent. As the weight of the years, with all their changes of desire and thought, gathers upon the spirit of the Eldar, so do the impulses and moods of their bodies change. [...]\nAlso the Eldar say that in the begetting [conceiving], and still more in the bearing of children, greater share and strength of their being, in mind and in body, goes forth than in the making of mortal children. For these reasons it came to pass that the Eldar brought forth few children; and also that their time of generation was in their youth or earlier life, unless strange and hard fates befell them.\nHistory of Middle-earth X Morgoth's Ring Part 3: &quot;The Later Quenta Silmarillion&quot; Chapter 2: &quot;The Second Phase&quot; Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\n\nThat last point about the toll on their mind and body is worth expanding on, and fortunately Tolkien does this later in the essay:\n\n[A]ll the Eldar, being aware of it in themselves, spoke of the passing of much strength, both of mind and of body, into their children, in bearing and begetting. Therefore they hold that the f\u00eba [soul], though unbegotten, draws nourishment directly from the f\u00eba of the mother while she bears and nourishes the hrondo [body; later changed to the word hro\u00e4], and mediately but equally from the father, whose f\u00eba is bound in union with the mother's and supports it.\nHistory of Middle-earth X Morgoth's Ring Part 3: &quot;The Later Quenta Silmarillion&quot; Chapter 2: &quot;The Second Phase&quot; Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\n"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A dedicated fan of J.R.R.

The following is a steps list detailing how to avoid becoming addicted, and how to un-addict yourself if you are already addicted.\n\n## Step\n\n1. Accept responsibility. The problem lies within the individual, not within the game. No attempt at beating 'addiction' can succeed until the individual accepts its existence. It is not the existence of video games, nor the content of games, but the person who chooses to play them.\n2. Identify the impact. How many hours a day do you spend playing games? Do you normally go out on the weekend? When was the last time you read a book? Identifying the negative impacts of the addiction will help you focus on positive improvements and getting back the things that you really are missing.\n3. Avoid blame. Blaming others for problems that you alone must face does not solve the problems. The 'gaming industry' or manufacturers are not the cause of this problem, and blaming them does not make the problem better. The vast, extreme majority of 'gamers' are healthy individuals, accepting responsibility is the first step.Also , do not make excuses : take responsibility.\n4. Stay positive. While it is important to identify the negative aspects of the problem, it is also important to focus on the goal and progress that you have made.\n5. Set limits. If you decide that you have one hour per day to spend playing games, stick to that. Choose your games correctly! If you are playing a game that requires many hours of gameplay between saves or which is an open-ended game like many MMOs, you likely should consider a different game or different genre of games.\n6. Monitor your child's video game time. You are the parent, and thus you are in control. If your children do not listen to you, removal of the game console or setting of administrative control on the computer may allow you to better handle the problem.\n7. Look in your drawer of CDs. Are there more than 5 games that you have played in the last two months? Are these games open-ended (like Civilization, World of Warcraft, or Evil Genius)? This could be a warning sign.\n8. Add up the total hours played per week. This includes time spent reading walkthroughs and watching videos and discussing games in real life. Always round up! If this number is over 25, then there may be a problem.\n9. Request that your parents put you on a strict time limit for computer playing. There are freeware programs available for download that can help with this. Playing hide-and-go-seek with your parents (hiding your games) is an effective way to minimize gaming overall.\n10. Find something else to do. You know the statement \"my anti-drug...\" This statement is better phrased \"my anti-addiction...\" or \"my anti-bad habit...\" The best way to do this is to develop a variety of other things to do, with others.\n\n\n## Friends\n\n1. Count how many games you play and how long you are playing them.\n2. Fix the problem by finding friends or spending more time with the ones you have.\n3. Step two could be hard for certain people. If you can't, ask a teacher or a parent. If there isn't one available, do it on your own.\n4. Find games to do outside. Play with your friends.\n5. Go get a book at the library. Read together.\n6. Do puzzles that could help your mind. Have contests with your friends.\n7. Come up with new fun games together and stay healthy.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned parent or individual with a personal interest in mental health, technology, and youth development.

{"conversations": ["How to celebrate chuseok?", "\"\ucd94\uc11d\" or \"Chuseok\" is a Korean harvest festival celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar. It is a very popular festival for Koreans as they reunite with their relatives and prepare for a feast. The origin of Chuseok is unsure but it has some traditional rites to be maintained. Thus Chuseok is celebrated in the rich harvest season when fruit and grain are abundant. Using the newly harvested rice, people make steamed rice, rice cakes, and liquor.\n\n## Pray and traditional customs\n\n1. Perform Charye or \ucc28\ub840. This is an ancestral memorial service where the entire family gathers together to perform the memorial service in the morning wearing hanbok. Charye is performed because Koreans believe that their ancestors aren't physically dead; their spirits are still alive. They prepare special food in their honor. Observe the important table arrangement for the Charye feast. Rice and soup are placed on the north side of the table, and fruits and vegetables are on the south. On the west and in the middle, meat dishes are served. On the east, rice cake and some drinks such as makgeolli or soju are placed.\n2. Practice Beolcho \"\ubc8c\ucd08\" and Seongmyo \"\uc131\ubb18\". Visit the ancestral graves and clean the weeds around the graves. This shows respect and devotion to one another. One month prior to the Chuseok, the families visit their ancestors' graves to clean the weeds, a practice which is called Beolcho, often causing congestion in Korea's highways. They again visit and clean the weeds around the graves during Chuseok.\n\n\n## Entertainment\n\n1. Play Ssireum. A Korean folk game similar to wrestling, it is extremely popular during the festival. Two competitors wrestle in the center of a sandpit and try to knock the other person over by using strength, skill and intelligence. It is a one on one tournament and the last person remaining wins the game.\n2. Perform the folk dance Kanggangsullae. This is a folk dance especially performed by women. They usually link arms and dance in a circle under the moonlight.\n3. Perform Sonori or Geobuknori. \"So\" and \"Geobuk\" literally mean \"cow\" and \"turtle\" in Hangeul. This celebration is a ritual performed by two people wearing a cape made of hanji and running around the local area as a cow and turtle, asking for foods from neighbors. The foods are often shared with relatives who can't afford Chuseok meals.\n\n\n## Food\n\n1. Eat songpyeon or \"\uc1a1\ud3b8\". This is a Korean traditional stuffed rice cake served as the Chuseok meal. The stuffings are made of healthy ingredients like sesame seeds, beans, nuts and honey. It is crucial to steam those cakes on pine-needles. It enhances the taste and fragrance along with the meaning of Songpyeon. Songpyeon is also significant because of the meaning contained in its shape. Songpyeon's rice skin itself resembles the shape of a full moon, but once it wraps the stuffing, its shape resembles the half-moon. There's a saying that the prettier you shape your songpyeon, the prettier your future daughter will be.\n2. Enjoy Hangwa. It is made with highly nutritious ingredients, such as rice flour, honey, fruit, and roots. People use edible natural ingredients to express various colors, flavors, and tastes. A few types of Hangwa are Yakgwa, Yugwa and Dasik, which are widely common as Korean confectionery items.\n3. Note that the name \"Hangwa\" is similar to another name for Chuseok, \"Hangawi\".\n4. Drink traditional liquors. These drinks are another significant and traditional side for a Chuseok feast. On Chuseok, families and relatives gather together and hold a memorial service for their ancestors with liquor made of the newly harvest rice. After the memorial service, they sit together and spend some time together as a family, drinking the liquor and eating the food.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual with an interest in Indian culture and traditions, seeking to learn about the customs and practices associated with Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.

{"conversations": ["How to become hot?", "Being hot is more than just a look\u2014it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you\u2019ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don\u2019t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today\u2019s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you\u2019re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you\u2019ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don\u2019t forget how much you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you\u2019ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don\u2019t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that\u2019s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don\u2019t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the \u201cperfect\u201d body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts \u2013 instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You\u2019ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There\u2019s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can\u2019t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you\u2019re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they\u2019re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men\u2019s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you\u2019d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate amount of skin. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it\u2019s not surprising when people can\u2019t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it\u2019s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It\u2019s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer\u2019s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body\u2019s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn\u2019t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren\u2019t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It\u2019s easy to start slumping forward when you\u2019re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they\u2019re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It\u2019s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It\u2019s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don\u2019t try so hard. Or at least look like you\u2019re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you\u2019re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It\u2019s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It\u2019s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you\u2019re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone\u2019s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don\u2019t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they\u2019re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental scientist, sustainability consultant, or eco-conscious individual with a keen interest in climate change mitigation strategies.

{"conversations": ["How to freeze lasagna?", "Freezing homemade lasagna is a great way to have ready-made meals on hand for nights when it's all you can do to turn the oven on and heat up dinner. When you make lasagna and freeze it for later, you'll have a homemade, healthy meal on hand whenever you need it. You can freeze lasagna baked or unbaked, but you'll need to thaw it overnight before cooking it to serve. See Step 1 to learn how to freeze lasagna so that it stays fresh-tasting.\n\n## Prepare the lasagna\n\n1. Make a freezer-friendly lasagna recipe. Some ingredients taste better than others when they're reheated after being frozen. Most lasagna recipes that call for fresh ingredients will be just fine after freezing, whether you freeze them unbaked or baked. However, if the recipe uses items that have already been frozen and thawed once, it's best not to freeze and thaw them twice. This increases the chance that the food could be contaminated by bacteria. For example, don't plan on freezing lasagna made with sausage or ground beef that was previously frozen. Instead, use fresh meat or leave it out completely. Food that is frozen and thawed more than once also suffers when it comes to flavor and texture. Choosing a recipe that calls for fresh ingredients will result in the best-tasting lasagna. If your favorite lasagna recipe calls for a frozen ingredient, the final dish usually won't be too affected by substituting the fresh version instead. For example, instead of using frozen mushrooms, just use fresh. In most cases you will have needed to thaw them anyway.\n2. Assemble the lasagna in a dish that can be frozen. Look for a \"freezer-proof\" label or be certain that the dish can be frozen as well as used for baking. Most glass or ceramic casserole dishes are fine for this purpose. Avoid using an aluminum pan for long-term storage of lasagna. The food might end up picking up a tinny taste. If you don't have a dish that can be used to both bake and freeze lasagna, you can bake it one dish and freeze it in a freezer-safe food storage container.\n3. Decide whether to bake it first. Lasagna that has been baked before freezing will still taste great after it has been reheated. Lasagna that has been assembled and frozen before baking is delicious, too. Use whichever method is most convenient for you, since the final texture and taste of the dish won't be too affected either way. You might decide to freeze pre-baked lasagna if you have leftovers after making a big batch. If you'd rather freeze it before baking, consider making two lasagnas next time you're having lasagna for dinner. You can bake one and freeze the other to eat later.\n4. Bring the lasagna to room temperature. If you want to freeze baked lasagna, it's necessary to make sure it has cooled entirely before you freeze it. Otherwise, the texture of the dish won't be as pleasant when it's time to eat it. After making the lasagna, set it aside for one hour to cool. You can also place it into the refrigerator to chill. Before placing it in the fridge, cover the lasagna with two layers of plastic wrap and one layer of kitchen foil.\n5. Cover the lasagna with freezer-safe plastic wrap. Don't use aluminum foil, since it might affect the taste of the lasagna. Cover it with several layers of plastic wrap to keep it fresh in the freezer. You may want to wrap the plastic around the entire dish, rather than just over the top. That way, you can make sure there are no gaps in the wrap where air could get in and cause freezer burn. Consider cutting the lasagna into individual portions and freezing them in bags. This way you won't have to reheat the entire thing if you only need a meal for one or two people. Cut the lasagna into serving sized-portions after it has chilled. This will help the pieces hold together better instead of falling apart. Put each piece in its own freezer-safe storage bag. No matter what, make sure it is double wrapped to prevent the lasagna from drying out.\n6. Freeze the lasagna. Label it and place it in the freezer. It can be frozen for up to three months, whether it has a meat or vegetable filling.\n\n\n## Thaw and reheat lasagna\n\n1. Thaw it overnight. The night before you intend to have the lasagna for dinner, thaw it overnight. If you try to bake it while it's still partially frozen, it will cook unevenly and the taste and texture will be affected. It will also be more difficult to determine whether it's done or not. You can thaw either the entire lasagna or portions in the refrigerator overnight.\n2. Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC/350\u00baF. This is the standard cooking temperature for lasagna. No matter what recipe you used, this is a good temperature for baking your lasagna to perfection.\n3. Ready the lasagna for baking. Unwrap all of the plastic wrap, and cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. This will keep the top from getting too brown while the rest of the lasagna cooks. If you're cooking an individual portion of lasagna, take the piece you want to bake out of its storage bag and place it on a suitable baking dish, then cover with foil.\n4. Bake the lasagna. Put it in the oven and cook it half an hour to 40 minutes, or until heated through. You may need to test a small piece from the center to make sure it isn't still cold in the middle. During the last 10 minutes of baking, you can remove the foil to allow the heat to reach the top if you want a brown, crispy crust on your lasagna. If you're just reheating an individual piece of lasagna, you can do it in the microwave instead of in the oven. Place it on a microwave-safe dish and microwave on high for 2 - 3 minutes, or until it's hot and bubbly. Do not use aluminum foil in the microwave.\n5. Serve the lasagna. Since it has been in the freezer for awhile, you might want to freshen it up by sprinkling some chipped basil or oregano on top.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A home cook or a food enthusiast who is interested in preserving food for later consumption, seeking practical advice on freezing lasagna to ensure it remains safe and delicious.

{"conversations": ["How to save gift wrapping paper?", "We've all seen promotional material for having \"green\" (environmentally sound) events, conserving paper, and saving trees.  In this article we'll see several alternatives to one time usage of rolls of wrapping paper for gifts.\n\n## Reuse wrap paper\n\n1. Wrap the gift in such a way as to promote reuse: When selecting wrapping paper, select paper which is durable. When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.\n2. Unwrap the gift for reuse, too. When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper. Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.\n3. Share the paper with several guests. If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.\n\n\n## Use gift bag with a gift tag\n\n1. Purchase a nice gift bag (or reusable bag), rather than wrapping paper for each gift.\n2. Make and attach a large gift tag to the bottom of the bag covering the manufacturers name, etc. Include at least 12 rows on the tag. Write your name, email, occasion and date on the first row of the tag.\n3. Place gift item in bag and present to honoree as usual. After honoree removes the gift from the bag, they save the bag for the next occasion.\n4. When the honoree has an occasion to give a gift, they write their name, occasion and date on the first blank line on the tag.\n5. Repeat the re-use and gifting process 12 times.\n6. Have the twelfth person to receive the gift bag send an email to everyone listed on the tag with the bag's history. Assuming the bag remains in usable condition, they can then attach a new tag on top of the original tag and repeat the process.\n7. Keep the reuse and gifting chain going until the back is too worn to continue. Ultimately, recycle the bag.\n\n\n## Make a gift display rather than gift wrap\n\n1. Bring unwrapped gifts to the celebration.\n2. Place the gifts on a display table. Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.\n3. Prepare a one page log for the honoree. It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift. The honoree can then use this log to send Thank You notes. Only one sheet of paper is consumed for the entire event!\n4. When it is time to present the gifts, position the honoree behind the table along with the guests. Take photos of the covered table, uncover the table and photograph the table displaying the gifts. (Optionally, make a video of the table being uncovered.)\n\n\n## Gift wrap (blindfold) the honoree instead of the gift\n\n1. If your honoree is adventuresome, blindfold them with an attractive looking bandana or blindfold prior to displaying or presenting any gifts.\n2. Present each gift to the blindfolded honoree while the people giving the gift stand behind them.\n3. Have the honoree identify the gift by feeling of it. If you want to make the task more challenging have the honoree wear attractive looking gloves or mittens while doing this. Optionally, have the honoree guess who gave them the gift.\n4. Of course, take numerous photos (and possibly video) of the gift giving process.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A budget-conscious individual who enjoys gift-giving and is looking for ways to reduce waste and save money.

{"conversations": ["Relationship between SVD and PCA. How to use SVD to perform PCA?", "Let the real values data matrix $\\mathbf X$ be of $n \\times p$ size, where $n$ is the number of samples and $p$ is the number of variables. Let us assume that it is centered, i.e. column means have been subtracted and are now equal to zero.\n\nThen the $p \\times p$ covariance matrix $\\mathbf C$ is given by $\\mathbf C = \\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf X/(n-1)$. It is a symmetric matrix and so it can be diagonalized: $$\\mathbf C = \\mathbf V \\mathbf L \\mathbf V^\\top,$$ where $\\mathbf V$ is a matrix of eigenvectors (each column is an eigenvector) and $\\mathbf L$ is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ in the decreasing order on the diagonal. The eigenvectors are called principal axes or principal directions of the data. Projections of the data on the principal axes  are called principal components, also known as PC scores; these can be seen as new, transformed, variables. The $j$-th principal component is given by $j$-th column of $\\mathbf {XV}$. The coordinates of the $i$-th data point in the new PC space are given by the $i$-th row of $\\mathbf{XV}$.\n\nIf we now perform singular value decomposition of $\\mathbf X$, we obtain a decomposition $$\\mathbf X = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top,$$ where $\\mathbf U$ is a unitary matrix (with columns called left singular vectors), $\\mathbf S$ is the diagonal matrix of singular values $s_i$ and $\\mathbf V$ columns are called right singular vectors. From here one can easily see that $$\\mathbf C = \\mathbf V \\mathbf S \\mathbf U^\\top \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top /(n-1) = \\mathbf V \\frac{\\mathbf S^2}{n-1}\\mathbf V^\\top,$$ meaning that right singular vectors $\\mathbf V$ are principal directions (eigenvectors) and that singular values are related to the eigenvalues of covariance matrix via $\\lambda_i = s_i^2/(n-1)$. Principal components are given by $\\mathbf X \\mathbf V = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top \\mathbf V = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S$.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. If $\\mathbf X = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top$, then the columns of $\\mathbf V$ are principal directions/axes (eigenvectors).\n2. Columns of $\\mathbf {US}$ are principal components (&quot;scores&quot;).\n3. Singular values are related to the eigenvalues of covariance matrix via $\\lambda_i = s_i^2/(n-1)$. Eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ show variances of the respective PCs.\n4. Standardized scores are given by columns of $\\sqrt{n-1}\\mathbf U$ and loadings are given by columns of $\\mathbf V \\mathbf S/\\sqrt{n-1}$. See e.g. here and here for why &quot;loadings&quot; should not be confused with principal directions.\n5. The above is correct only if $\\mathbf X$ is centered. Only then is covariance matrix equal to $\\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf X/(n-1)$.\n6. The above is correct only for $\\mathbf X$ having samples in rows and variables in columns. If variables are in rows and samples in columns, then $\\mathbf U$ and $\\mathbf V$ exchange interpretations.\n7. If one wants to perform PCA on a correlation matrix (instead of a covariance matrix), then columns of $\\mathbf X$ should not only be centered, but standardized as well, i.e. divided by their standard deviations.\n8. To reduce the dimensionality of the data from $p$ to $k&lt;p$, select $k$ first columns of $\\mathbf U$, and $k\\times k$ upper-left part of $\\mathbf S$. Their product $\\mathbf U_k \\mathbf S_k$ is the required $n \\times k$ matrix containing first $k$ PCs.\n9. Further multiplying the first $k$ PCs by the corresponding principal axes $\\mathbf V_k^\\top$ yields $\\mathbf X_k = \\mathbf U_k^\\vphantom \\top \\mathbf S_k^\\vphantom \\top \\mathbf V_k^\\top$ matrix that has the original $n \\times p$ size but is of lower rank (of rank $k$). This matrix $\\mathbf X_k$ provides a reconstruction of the original data from the first $k$ PCs. It has the lowest possible reconstruction error, see my answer here.\n10. Strictly speaking, $\\mathbf U$ is of $n\\times n$ size and $\\mathbf V$ is of $p \\times p$ size. However, if $n&gt;p$ then the last $n-p$ columns of $\\mathbf U$ are arbitrary (and corresponding rows of $\\mathbf S$ are constant zero); one should therefore use an economy size (or thin) SVD that returns $\\mathbf U$ of $n\\times p$ size, dropping the useless columns. For large $n\\gg p$ the matrix $\\mathbf U$ would otherwise be unnecessarily huge.

How can I mount this image?", "You can't mount the image as a whole because it actually contains two partitions and a boot sector.  However, you can mount the individual partitions in the image if you know their offset inside the file.  To find them, examine the image as a block device with ```fdisk -l whatever.img```.  The output should include a table like this:\n```Device         Boot     Start       End  Blocks  Id System\nwhatever.img1            8192    122879   57344   c W95 FAT32 (LBA)\nwhatever.img2          122880   5785599 2831360  83 Linux\n```\nThese are the two partitions.

Above this table, there's some other information about the device as a whole, including:\n```Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\n```\nWe can find the offset in bytes by multiplying this unit size by the ```Start``` block of the partition:\n\n* 1st partition 512 * 8192 = 4194304\n* 2nd partition 512 * 122880 = 62914560\n\nThese can be used with the ```offset``` option of the ```mount``` command.  We also have a clue about the type of each partition from ```fdisk```.

{"conversations": ["Why can't MX records point to an IP address?", "The whole idea behind the mail exchange (MX) record is to specify a host or hosts which can accept mail for a domain. As specified in RFC 1035, the MX record contains a domain name. It must therefore point to a host which itself can be resolved in the DNS. An IP address could not be used as it would be interpreted as an unqualified domain name, which cannot be resolved.\n\nThe reasons for this in the 1980s, when the specs were originally written, are almost the same as the reasons for it today: A host may be connected to multiple networks and use multiple protocols.\n\nBack in the 80s, it was not uncommon to have mail gateways which connected both to the (relatively new) Internet which used TCP/IP and to other legacy networks, which often used other protocols. Specifying MX in this way allowed for DNS records which could identify how to reach such a host on a network other than the Internet, such as Chaosnet. In practice, though, this almost never happened; virtually everyone re-engineered their networks to become part of the Internet instead.\n\nToday, the situation is that a host may be reached by multiple protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) and by multiple IP addresses in each protocol. A single MX record can't possibly list more than one address, so the only option is to point to a host, where all of that host's addresses can then be looked up. (As a performance optimization, the DNS server will send along the address records for the host in the response additional section if it has authoritative records for them, saving a round trip.)\n\nThere is also the situation that arises when your mail exchangers are provided by a third party (e.g. Google Apps or Office 365).

{"conversations": ["Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20\u00b0C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.", "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp.

{"conversations": ["In Dupire's local volatility model, the volatility is is a deterministic function of the underlying price and time, chosen to match observed European option prices.\nTo be more specific, given a smooth surface $(K,T)\\mapsto C(K,T)$ where K is the strike and T is time to maturity. Dupire equation implies that there exits an unique continuous function $\\sigma_{loc}$ defined by\n$$\\sigma_{loc}^{2}(K,T)=\\frac{\\partial_{T}C(K,T)+rK\\partial_{K}C(K,T)}{\\frac{1}{2}K^{2}\\partial_{KK}C(K,T)}$$ for all $(K,T)\\in(0,\\infty)\\times(0,\\infty)$ such that the solution to the stochastic differential equation $dS_{t}/S_{t}=rdt+\\sigma(t,S_{t})dW_{t}$ exactly generates the European call option prices.\nWhat do the dynamics of the local volatility mean? Are dynamics equivalent to the volatility surface? Why the dynamics of local volatility model is highly unrealistic?", "A general model (with continuous paths) can be written\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r_t dt + \\sigma_t dW_t^S\n$$\nwhere the short rate $r_t$ and spot volatility $\\sigma_t$ are stochastic processes. \nIn the Black-Scholes model both $r$ and $\\sigma$ are deterministic functions of time (even constant in the original model). This produces a flat smile for any expiry $T$. And we have the closed form formula for option prices\n$$\n  C(t,S;T,K) = BS(S,T-t,K;\\Sigma(T,K))\n$$\nwhere $BS$ is the BS formula and $\\Sigma(T,K) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T-t}\\int_t^T \\sigma(s)^2 ds}$. This is not consistent with the smile observed on the market. In order to match market prices, one needs to use a different volatility for each expiry and strike. This is the implied volatility surface $(T,K) \\mapsto \\Sigma(T,K)$. \nIn the local volatility model, rates are deterministic, instant volatility is stochastic but there is only one source of randomness\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r(t) dt + \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) dW_t^S\n$$\nthis is a special case of the general model with\n$$\n  d\\sigma_t = (\\partial_t \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + r(t)S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + \\frac{1}{2}S_t^2\\partial_S^2\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)) dt + \\frac{1}{2}S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)^2 dW_t^S\n$$\nWhat is appealing with this model is that the function $\\sigma_{Dup}$ can be perfectly calibrated to match all market vanilla prices (and quite easily too). \nThe problem is that while correlated to the spot, statistical study show that the volatility also has its own source of randomness independent of that of the spot. Mathematically, this means the instant correlation between the spot and vol is not 1 contrary to what happens in the local volatility model. \nThis can be seen in several ways:\n\n1. The forward smile. Forward implied volatility is implied from prices of forward start options: ignoring interest rates,\n$$\n  C(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K) := E^Q[(\\frac{S_{T+\\theta}}{S_{T}}-K)_+] =: C_{BS}(S=1,\\theta,K;\\Sigma(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K))\n$$\nAlternatively, it is sometimes defined as the expectation of implied volatility at a forward date. In a LV model, as the maturity $T$ increases but $\\theta$ is kept constant, the forward smile gets flatter and higher. This is not what we observe in the markets where the forward smile tends to be similar to the current smile.\n\nThis is because the initial smile you calibrate the model too has decreasing skew:\n$$\n\\partial_K \\Sigma(0,S;T,K) \\xrightarrow[T\\to +\\infty]{} 0\n$$ \n\n2. Smile rolling. In a LV model, smile tends to move in the opposite direction of the spot and get higher independently of the direction of the spot.\nThis is not consistent with what is observed on markets. See Hagan and al. Managing Smile Risk for the derivation. This means that\n$\\partial_S \\Sigma_{LV}(t,S;T,K)$ often has the wrong sign so your Delta will be wrong which can lead to a higher hedging error than using BS. \n3. Barrier options. In FX markets, barrier options like Double No Touch are liquid but a LV model calibrated to vanilla prices does not reproduce these prices. This is a consequence of the previous point.   \n\nThe LV model is a static model. Its whole dynamic comes from the volatility surface at time 0. But the vol surface has a dynamic that is richer than that.\nThere are alternatives using multiple factors like SV models, LSV models (parametric local vol like SABR or fully non parametric local vol), models of the joint dynamic of the spot and vol surface etc... but the LV model remains the default model in many cases due to its simplicity, its ability to calibrate the initial smile perfectly and its numerical efficiency.

{"conversations": ["According to the sources I have found, a lambda expression is essentially implemented by the compiler creating a class with overloaded function call operator and the referenced variables as members. This suggests that the size of lambda expressions varies, and given enough references variables that size can be arbitrarily large.\nAn ```std::function``` should have a fixed size, but it must be able to wrap any kind of callables, including any lambdas of the same kind. How is it implemented? If ```std::function``` internally uses a pointer to its target, then what happens, when the ```std::function``` instance is copied or moved? Are there any heap allocations involved?", "The implementation of ```std::function``` can differ from one implementation to another, but the core idea is that it uses type-erasure. While there are multiple ways of doing it, you can imagine a trivial (not optimal) solution could be like this (simplified for the specific case of ```std::function<int (double)>``` for the sake of simplicity):\n```struct callable_base {\n   virtual int operator()(double d) = 0;\n   virtual ~callable_base() {}\n};\ntemplate <typename F>\nstruct callable : callable_base {\n   F functor;\n   callable(F functor) : functor(functor) {}\n   virtual int operator()(double d) { return functor(d); }\n};\nclass function_int_double {\n   std::unique_ptr<callable_base> c;\npublic:\n   template <typename F>\n   function(F f) {\n      c.reset(new callable<F>(f));\n   }\n   int operator()(double d) { return c(d); }\n// ...\n};\n```\nIn this simple approach the ```function``` object would store just a ```unique_ptr``` to a base type. For each different functor used with the ```function```, a new type derived from the base is created and an object of that type instantiated dynamically. The ```std::function``` object is always of the same size and will allocate space as needed for the different functors in the heap.\nIn real life there are different optimizations that provide performance advantages but would complicate the answer. The type could use small object optimizations, the dynamic dispatch can be replaced by a free-function pointer that takes the functor as argument to avoid one level of indirection, but the idea is basically the same.\n\nRegarding the issue of how copies of the ```std::function``` behave, a quick test indicates that copies of the internal callable object are done, rather than sharing the state.\n```// g++4.8\nint main() {\n   int value = 5;\n   typedef std::function<void()> fun;\n   fun f1 = [=]() mutable { std::cout << value++ << '\\n' };\n   fun f2 = f1;\n   f1();                    // prints 5\n   fun f3 = f1;\n   f2();                    // prints 5\n   f3();                    // prints 6 (copy after first increment)\n}\n```\nThe test indicates that ```f2``` gets a copy of the callable entity, rather than a reference.

Building a network of pipes to convey water to houses is a major effort, and most places where that's been done found it extremely expensive. Providing a second set of pipes to bring salt water to houses would probably cost about the same. Except that cities go to considerable lengths to put their water reservoirs above the city as far as possible so they don't have to use as much energy for pumping.

They grow things in the sewage to break it down. But most of those things won't grow in salt water. It's already a challenge keeping toxic chemicals out of the sewage. For this to work it might be necessary to add a second set of sewer pipes to carry the water away, and develop new methods of treating that salty sewage (the treated sewage couldn't be spread on farmland, for example).\nIt would be far simpler, cheaper and more reliable to simply buy everyone a composting toilet to replace each toilet they currently have. As a halfway measure, mandating more economical toilets would help, as would education campaigns like the  ones encouraging people not to flush at all when they urinate.

{"conversations": ["How does immersion passively help with learning a language?", "There are a few reasons why immersion helps you learn a language without you actively trying:\n* You encounter the language more often.  When you are immersed in a language, you don't go to class and do homework for a few hours a week, but rather use the language the entire day.  You depend on the language to survive\u2014to buy groceries, to talk to employers and customers, to ask for directions, etc.  Being forced to use the language means you learn it even when you're not actively trying to. It becomes a way of life.\n* You learn the language in more than one way.  Classroom learning focuses on specific activities at a time and generally is oriented around learning vocabulary and grammar.  Immersion implicitly forces you to learn vocabulary (if you don't know a word, you simply can't communicate) and grammar (people will probably correct you if you say something incorrectly).  You will learn these things whether you're trying to or not.  In addition you will learn how to carry on a conversation, both by listening and participating in your own. This is something that simple exercises can very rarely accomplish.\n* You begin to think in the language. If you use the language enough you'll start to get good enough at it that you won't have time to think in your native language and translate. Immersion spurs this on because native speakers talk relatively quickly, signs you read may pass by in a moment, and you may quickly need to say \"excuse me\" or ask for help.  Because you can't afford long delays, you'll begin to skip the translation step. This helps you use the language as a native speaker would.\n* Culture reinforces language learning. When you are immersed in a language, you often encounter the culture and traditions associated with speakers of that language. Your brain will retain the new knowledge and experiences you acquire better because it is different than what you are used to, and if the language is part of that cultural experience, you will remember it better.  For example, you might remember an idiom or a joke that only exists in the language you are learning.

Why didn't they choose the simple way out and use function defining keyword?", "Dennis Ritchie\u2019s paper on The Development of the C Language gives some idea of the reasoning behind this: namely, the fundamental rule in C that declaration syntax should match expression syntax\"\n\nFor each object of such a composed type, there was already a way to mention the underlying object: index the array, call the function, use the indirection operator on the pointer. Analogical reasoning led to a declaration syntax for names mirroring that of the expression syntax in which the names typically appear. Thus,\n```int i, *pi, **ppi;\n```\ndeclare an integer, a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a pointer to an integer. The syntax of these declarations reflects the observation that ```i```, ```*pi```, and ```**ppi``` all yield an ```int``` type when used in an expression. Similarly,\n```int f(), *f(), (*f)();\n```\ndeclare a function returning an integer, a function returning a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a function returning an integer;\n```int *api[10], (*pai)[10];\n```\ndeclare an array of pointers to integers, and a pointer to an array of integers. In all these cases the declaration of a variable resembles its usage in an expression whose type is the one named at the head of the declaration.\n\n\nIt appears this rule trumped parser considerations. Its immediate consequence is that function declarations can\u2019t use specific keywords, or impose a different ordering of declaration components.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that parsing was somewhat different in early C, since function declarations didn\u2019t specify their arguments, and function definitions separated the argument list from the argument declarations (which weren\u2019t necessary for ```int``` arguments):\n```sum();\n```\ndeclares a ```sum``` function, which would then be defined as\n```sum(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n(no types needed here, the default is ```int```).

Remaining unseen: Obviously, during night its dark and this gives you a fair bit of cover if you want to remain unseen. This reason for traveling at night is common for many hunters in the animal kingdom (and sometimes also their prey), has been used by humans in insecure or hostile territory for centuries and remains a standard technique for some military operations even today. \n\n2. Evading the elements: Hiking throughout the night and resting in the day can be especially useful in hot, arid conditions. For example in deserts, extreme heat during the day and severe cold in the night often come together. Hiking during the night here serves the double purpose of keeping you active and warm when it is cold while allowing you to save water resources during the day.\n\n3. Boosting morale: When conditions get worse (cold, moisture), getting up during the night and starting to hike will not only make you feel warm again, it will also boost your morale. Being active, and actively coping with a bad situation rather than staying miserable in the tent for the rest of the night will make you feel better.\n\n4. You want to avoid tourists: No, seriously, this is a real case in point.

{"conversations": ["Apparently, the air inside a soap bubble is under higher pressure than the surrounding air. This is for instance apparent in the sound bubbles make when they burst. Why is the pressure inside the bubble higher in the first place?", "The increased pressure is caused by the surface tension between the soap and the surrounding air. This can be seen by a simple equilibrium energy argument. The total energy of the system reads\n$$\n  E = E_i + E_o + E_s \\;,\n$$\nwhere $E_i$ is the energy associated with the air inside the bubble, $E_s$ is the interfacial energy, and $E_o$ denotes the energy associated with the air outside of the bubble. Importantly, the contribution of the surface energy is given by $E_s = 2 \\gamma A$, where $\\gamma$ is the surface tension and $A$ is the surface area of the bubble. The factor of 2 emerges, since there are actually two interfaces (one facing the inside of the soap bubble and one facing the outside).\n\nIn equilibrium, the total energy will be minimal. We thus analyze the total differential of the energy. Here, the differentials of the partial energies of the air can be approximated by the ideal gas law, which yields $dE_i = -p_i dV_i$ and $dE_o = -p_o dV_o$.\n\nNext, we have to discuss the degrees of freedom of the system. Generally, the soap bubble wants to keep its spherical shape to minimize the surface area (and thus the surface energy $E_s$) at a given volume. This leaves us with a single parameter, the radius $R$ of the bubble, which can be varied in any process. The volume differentials then become $dV_1 = 4\\pi R^2 dR$ and $dV_2 = -4\\pi R^2 dR$. Additionally, the surface area changes by $dA = 8\\pi R dR$. The differential of the surface energy thus reads $dE_s = 2\\gamma 8\\pi R dR$, provided that the surface tension stays constant.\n\nNow we got everything and can express the differential of the total energy as\n$$\n  dE = -p_i 4 \\pi R^2 dR + p_o 4\\pi R^2 dR + 2\\gamma 8\\pi R dR \\;.\n$$\nDividing by $4\\pi R^2$ and noting that $dE/dR$ vanishes in equilibrium, we thus arrive at\n$$\n  p_i - p_o = \\frac{4\\gamma}{R} \\;.\n$$\nThis expression shows that the pressure inside the bubble is large than outside. The pressure difference is two times the Laplace pressure $2\\gamma/R$.", "Can this be viewed intuitively from the perpective of the fact that in order for a bubble to form a higher-pressure must be applied to the air in front of the bubble; i.e. it must be blown into? Since this high-pressure air is the air that goes into the bubble, shouldn't this air be of this higher pressure for all time, rather like a balloon?", "It is true, that the ideas employed here are the same that would explain why the pressure inside a balloon is higher than outside. In order to inflate a balloon you want to blow extra air inside it. This is only possible when the pressure you create in your mouth is larger than the pressure in the interior of the balloon, since the air always flows from regions of large to small pressure in this example. Consequently, the fact that your have to blow quite a bit means that there is quite some pressure inside the balloon."], "source": "multi_turn", "questioner": "A curious and inquisitive individual with a strong interest in physics and chemistry.

{"conversations": ["How to become hot?", "Being hot is more than just a look\u2014it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you\u2019ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don\u2019t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today\u2019s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you\u2019re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you\u2019ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don\u2019t forget how much you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you\u2019ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don\u2019t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that\u2019s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don\u2019t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the \u201cperfect\u201d body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts \u2013 instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You\u2019ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There\u2019s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can\u2019t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you\u2019re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they\u2019re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men\u2019s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you\u2019d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate amount of skin. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it\u2019s not surprising when people can\u2019t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it\u2019s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It\u2019s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer\u2019s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body\u2019s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn\u2019t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren\u2019t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It\u2019s easy to start slumping forward when you\u2019re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they\u2019re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It\u2019s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It\u2019s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don\u2019t try so hard. Or at least look like you\u2019re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you\u2019re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It\u2019s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It\u2019s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you\u2019re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone\u2019s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don\u2019t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they\u2019re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental scientist, sustainability consultant, or eco-conscious individual with a keen interest in climate change mitigation strategies.

{"conversations": ["How to do the charleston?", "The Charleston is a medium- to fast-tempo dance that originated in the 20s. It was renowned for being the first social dance one could do without a partner. There are several versions of Charleston, the most popular being the 20s and 30s Charleston. The Charleston is a highly adaptable move that can be incorporated into a wide variety of dances, but the basic movement is the same.\n\n## Master the basic move\n\n1. Take a rock step back with your left foot. Touching the front of your foot to the floor, but not bringing your heel down. Don\u2019t fully shift your weight to this foot. When doing the Charleston, lean forward slightly and bend your knees a little. Keep your weight on the balls of your feet. A rock step, also called a break step, refers to a rocking step in which one\u2019s weight is very briefly transferred to another foot before being returned to the first. The only time when you might begin with your right foot is if you are following a partner. When two people dance the Charleston together, the leader starts by stepping back on the left foot, while the follower starts by stepping back on the right, mirroring the leader.\n2. Step back forward with your left foot. It should now be a step ahead of your right foot. This time, shift your weight to your left foot.\n3. Take another rock step forward with your right foot. Put the heel of your foot on the ground without bringing your whole foot down. Your weight should end up on your left foot still.\n4. Step back with your right foot. It should now be a step behind your left foot. Shift your weight back onto your right foot.\n5. Swing your arms as you step. As you move, your arms should be swinging. This may happen automatically, especially if you\u2019ve seen people do the Charleston before and know what it\u2019s supposed to look like. When your left foot is in front of you, your right arm should swing forward. When your right foot is in front of you, your left arm should swing forward.\n6. Repeat this movement. It probably won\u2019t look terribly impressive on its own, but the back, forward, forward, back motion is the building block for every variation on the Charleston. Practice until it feels natural. Then you\u2019ll be ready to start mixing things up.\n\n\n## Do the 20s charleston\n\n1. Get comfortable with the basic move. All the variations of the Charleston start with being able to do the basic step. Practice until it becomes second nature.\n2. Twist your feet in and out. Keep your weigh on the balls of your feet. On every step, the heel of the foot your have your weight on should twist out and then in again.\n3. Lift your elbows as you swing your arms. This is basically an exaggerated version of the arm swing. As always, your left arm should swing forward when your right foot is ahead of your body, and your right arm should swing forward when your left foot is in front of your body. Your arms should be bent at about a 90 degree angle. The elbow of the arm that is swinging back should come to shoulder height, and the forearm of the arm that is swinging forward should be parallel to the ground.\n4. Pivot your knees in and out. One common move used with the Charleston involves opening and closing your knees at the same time as crossing and uncrossing your arms. This may be the most well-known Charleston move. Begin with your knees bent and touching each other, with your arms crossed over them, so that your right hand is on your left knee, and your left hand is on your right now. Spread your knees apart while simultaneously uncrossing your arms, so that you end up with your left hand on your left knee, and your right hand on your right knee. #\\*Repeat this move a few times.\n\n\n## Do the 30s charleston\n\n1. Get comfortable with the basic move. All the variations of the Charleston start with being able to do the basic step. Practice until it becomes second nature.\n2. Replace a normal step with a kick step. This will add a little pep to the move. Instead of simply stepping forward, bring your knee up and kick your foot out. Your knee should come up first, propelling your foot forward a moment later. If you would not be transferring your weight to that foot anyway for this step, just swing it back again without letting it touch the ground. Otherwise, plant it back on the ground after the kick.\n3. Add a hitch as you move your leg back. Instead of simply stepping back after a kick, incorporate a hitch into the movement. Bring your knee back up, so that your upper leg is parallel to the ground, before kicking your foot back again.\n4. Touch the ground with your hand. This adds slightly more difficulty and flare. As your leg swings back and the ball of your foot touches the ground, lean forward and tap the ground with the tips of the fingers of your opposite hand.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A business owner or manager seeking to modernize their company's technology infrastructure and processes.

The process can be instantaneous or may take ages, I do not mind which as I need to weigh my options at this stage. \nTo be clear, the devolution I am thinking of is like taking a human being then devolving him/her to the primate stage, so lets say about as far back as Orrorin tugenensis or Paranthropus where they are in the midst of evolving from primates to Homo erectus. Please note I used human beings as an example to give context but the species undergoing devolution may not necessarily be human.\nBased on the answers, \"devolution\" does not exist so had the word in quotes to reflect this. ", "Devolution doesn't really ever occur, organisms simply adapt to best suit their environment over time. A good example is cave dwelling Troglodyte type species that have lost the ability to see. They haven't actually devolved to not have eyes, they simply did not need them and evolved to save valuable energy and nutrients by not growing a sight organ that would be useless in their environment. It isn't devolution, it's still evolution since they are changing to better suit their environment. So, at least as far as natural processes go, a species would need to become stuck in an environment for a few hundred thousand years that heavily discourages intellect, sociability, communication skills, culture, and inventiveness. That's a tough one to come up with since such traits are usually the most powerful ones for surviving something.\n\nSo here's the environment and scenario I'm thinking of. Your smart guy race is in the stone age, its pretty much on par with homo sapiens and where they were at about 10,000-15,000 years ago. But something catastrophic doesn't happen. The world slowly becomes a perfect Eden with very few predators, a perfect climate, and vast endless fields of grain and forests of fruit bearing trees. No ice age, no super-predators like we saw in said ice age. No famines or depredation, no rabid competition between several human subspecies for the same resources. The planet (Henceforth known as paradise) is literally perfect. Too perfect. Why would a species that has as close as possible to absolutely nothing to worry about need to even develop the ability to worry? Those big craniums and complex brains waste space and make childbirth more dangerous than necessary. There is absolutely nothing gained by possessing speech, abstract thought, or cooperative culture when all a species needs to do to be successful is to wander around placidly in small familial groups grazing mindlessly on the limitless amounts of food. Shelter is utterly not necessary since you have a perfect climate, nor is clothing, and food is so ludicrously plentiful there is no need to make tools.

{"conversations": ["How to drive economically?", "Everyone needs to use a car from time to time, but gas can be expensive. Driving more economically can save you money and keep your car\u2019s parts from wearing quickly. By avoiding aggressive driving, managing gears and electronics, and performing regular maintenance, you can drive more economically no matter where you\u2019re going.\n\n## Avoid aggressive drive\n\n1. Brake in a controlled manner. Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you\u2019ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don\u2019t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel.\n2. Accelerate smoothly. Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money.\n3. Minimize distractions. Whether you\u2019re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions. Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It\u2019s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.\n\n\n## Manage gear and electronics\n\n1. Use air conditioning wisely. At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way.\n2. Cut down on electronics. Your car\u2019s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren\u2019t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings.\n3. Use your gears effectively. Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car\u2019s engine. To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration. While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently. Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you\u2019re new to the technique.\n\n\n## Perform routine maintenance\n\n1. Check your tire pressure regularly. Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently.\n2. Use the right specification of engine oil. Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner\u2019s manual.\n3. Get your car serviced regularly. Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.\n\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Pack light. Bringing extra luggage or hauling large items requires more gas to get your car from place to place. Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle.\n2. Map your journey. Getting lost certainly won\u2019t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you\u2019re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient.\n3. Carpool when possible. Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You\u2019ll also save your car from more wear and tear.\n4. Combine errands. Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start \u201ccold\u201d less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally-focused individual, possibly a commuter or car owner, looking for ways to minimize their environmental impact while still maintaining a budget-friendly driving experience.

Whether you\u2019re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions. Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It\u2019s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.\n\n\n## Manage gear and electronics\n\n1. Use air conditioning wisely. At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way.\n2. Cut down on electronics. Your car\u2019s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren\u2019t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings.\n3. Use your gears effectively. Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car\u2019s engine. To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration. While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently. Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you\u2019re new to the technique.\n\n\n## Perform routine maintenance\n\n1. Check your tire pressure regularly. Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently.\n2. Use the right specification of engine oil. Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner\u2019s manual.\n3. Get your car serviced regularly. Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.\n\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Pack light. Bringing extra luggage or hauling large items requires more gas to get your car from place to place. Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle.\n2. Map your journey. Getting lost certainly won\u2019t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you\u2019re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient.\n3. Carpool when possible. Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You\u2019ll also save your car from more wear and tear.\n4. Combine errands. Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start \u201ccold\u201d less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally-focused individual, possibly a commuter or car owner, looking for ways to minimize their environmental impact while still maintaining a budget-friendly driving experience.

{"conversations": ["How to deal with a married boyfriend?", "Entering into a relationship with a married man might seem appealing to some women; however, it can also become a very difficult and painful experience.  There are many reasons why a woman might be attracted to a married man and learning these reasons as well as the difficulties of such a relationship can help you decide what to do.\n\n## Learn the risk\n\n1. Be aware that he likely won't leave his wife. Although your boyfriend may claim he is willing to or about to leave his wife, most married men are not actually ready or planning to do so. During your time with your boyfriend, you should understand that the chances of him leaving his wife to be with you exclusively are small. If he is finalizing his divorce, then he may actually be serious about leaving his wife. Most men will not leave their wife to be with their girlfriend.\n2. Realize that he will always be connected to his family. If your boyfriend has children with his wife, you should understand that he will always have a connection to his children and possibly with his wife. Even if your boyfriend leaves his wife, his children will still be part of his life and he may be required to share visitation rights with her. Be prepared for this if you continue to pursue your relationship with him.\n3. Prepare yourself for a difficult relationship. Dating a married man is almost always a difficult relationship and is one that is likely to emotionally hurt those involved. You should be fully aware of this if you plan to continue your relationship with your married boyfriend.\n\n\n## Understand why women want to date a marry man\n\n1. Examine your relationship for any thrill seeking behavior. The hidden nature of your relationship may be what keeps one or both of you interested. Sneaking around, keeping secrets and hiding the relationship can all be exhilarating and boost the attachment between the two of you. Understand that if you are interested in your boyfriend because of the thrill, an exclusive relationship with him will likely lose its appeal.\n2. Ask yourself if you have based the relationship in competition. Some women are highly competitive and this competitive nature can express itself in relationships as well. Women who desire a married man may do so because they feel that they are a superior woman to the man's wife. This can cause them to pursue the husband in order to prove to themselves and others that they are the \u201cwinner\u201d.\n3. Discover any issues with trust that you may have. Some women may have difficulty trusting a man. The appeal of seeing a married man is found in the fact that they can't be cheated on because they are the one doing the cheating. Women who have a married boyfriend are also not likely to be restricted in who they themselves are allowed to see romantically. A lack of trust can be the reason behind your relationship.\n\n\n## Date during a divorce\n\n1. Be aware of your boyfriend's wife. Although you may be dating your boyfriend during his divorce, you will still have to contend with how his wife might view you. You will have to be careful with any interaction you might have with your boyfriend's wife as they may feel resentful towards you and try to cause you trouble. Your boyfriends wife may try to turn his children against you. The wife of your boyfriend might try to attack your image amongst family and friends. Your relationship may cause the divorce proceedings to take longer or become more expensive.\n2. Keep your relationship discreet. Dating your boyfriend during a divorce can be a troublesome and difficult time for both of you. Keeping your relationship discreet and private can help keep things as calm and stable as can be during the divorce proceedings. Wait until after the divorce before making your relationship a public one. Don't get involved with your boyfriend's children until after the divorce is finalized.\n3. Make sure your boyfriend is physically separated from his wife. If you start dating your boyfriend while he still lives with his wife, this might be legally determined to be the reason for the failure of his marriage. If your relationship is determined to be the reason his marriage failed it can cause your boyfriend to lose more of his assets during the divorce. Wait until your boyfriend is living away from his wife before dating.\n\n\n## Discover if your boyfriend be marry\n\n1. Take note of when your boyfriend is available. If your boyfriend is usually unavailable on weekends of evenings, but talks to you first thing in the morning, he might be married. Your boyfriend might be with his wife during these times and this can be the reason he isn't returning your calls or texts. Take note of when your boyfriend is available to talk. If he talks with you only during times when he is at work or away from home, he might be married. Unless he has to work on the weekends, he should be able to meet or talk with you.\n2. Think about how much you know about his personal life. Married men don't often share many details of their personal life. This might be an effort to cover up their marriage by exuding any information that could reveal it. Think of how much you know about your boyfriend and his personal life to see if he might be withholding any important information. He will likely not mention where he lives. Your boyfriend might not talk about his friends in case you might know them and ask them for more details about his life. He might not talk about his past relationships in order to avoid revealing anything about his current marriage.\n3. Ask yourself if your boyfriend hides his family from you. If your boyfriend is currently married there is a good chance that he will avoid taking you to meet his family. A married boyfriend will likely try to keep your relationship a secret. If you meet his family your relationship will be revealed. If you have been dating your boyfriend for a long period of time and he avoids a meeting between you and his family, he might be married.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned individual seeking advice on navigating a complex relationship situation.

{"conversations": ["How to dress nice every day (for girls)?", "Dressing nicely each day can take some effort but will ultimately be worth it if your outfits make you feel confident and happy. If you want to look great every day, you will first have to go through your wardrobe and fill it with classic outfit staples. Looking awesome also involves some planning and accessorizing that may take some getting used to but will ultimately result in some stylish outfits.\n\n## Fill your wardrobe\n\n1. Buy classic pieces. To dress nicely, it is important to have some classic pieces in your wardrobe that will never go out of style. Classic pieces are articles of clothing that are generally not too extreme or dated. Instead, they are generally simple and elegant, like a navy blue blazer or a well-crafted black V-neck t-shirt. Though they may sound simple, you can always dress these pieces up with accessories. Basic, classic pieces are generally easier to mix and match, which means that they can be used in a variety of outfits.\n2. Purchase a few accent articles of clothing. To go along with your classic articles of clothing, buy some accent pieces that will make your outfits pop, even if they are simple. These accents could be bright colors that you don\u2019t normally wear or patterns that pop. For example, you could take an outfit that is as simple as a white t-shirt and a navy blue skirt, and make it interesting with a patterned sweater.\n3. Purchase clothes that you can mix and match. When going through your wardrobe, consider whether or not you can use each article of clothing in at least two different outfits. Mixing and matching is an important part of dressing nicely everyday. While you most likely can\u2019t purchase a new outfit for every day of the week, you can buy clothing that you can mix and match to create entirely new and exciting outfits.\n4. Consider your body when picking out your clothes. Certain clothes have cuts that look different on different body types. Look for clothes that flatter your body and make you feel confident. Each person has their idea of what they find flatters their bodies the most, so spend some time trying on different kinds of clothes. For example:\n\t* If you have a \u2018Pear\u2019 shape, which means that you have wider hips and a slimmer bust, you could try out an open-neck top, or a dress with an empire waist.\n5. Get rid of clothes that are worn or torn. Part of dressing nicely means giving away or selling old clothes. Clothes get worn out, especially if you wear the same piece a lot, and worn-out clothing does not necessarily look very classy\u2014unless you are going for a look that involves faded clothes and torn jeans. If you find that a shirt has a stain, try your best to get it out, but if the stain remains, it might be time to toss the shirt. Clothes with stains tend to look a little sloppy.\n6. Consider your skin tone when buying your clothes. Picking out clothing that complements your skin tone can make a great outfit that much nicer. Of course, always keep in mind that if you don\u2019t like a color or don\u2019t feel like it looks good on you, don\u2019t wear it. Part of dressing nicely is dressing in things that make you confident and happy; if a certain color matches your skin tone, but you don\u2019t like it anyway, don\u2019t wear it. General guidelines for skin tones and clothing colors include:\n\t* Very light skin tones: Ice tones, pale pinks, greys, baby blues, navies, and grass greens. Medium-light skin tones: Pastel colors, cool reds, and blues. Avoid orange. Medium skin tones: Metallic tones, jewel tones, plums, wine reds, bright blues, deep purples. Medium-dark skin tones: Deep colors like dark greens, bright blues, pale yellows, warm reds. Very dark skin tones: Bright colors like burgundies, cobalt blue, bright orange, and red.\n7. Hang up your clothes and invest in an iron. Another part of dressing nicely is keeping your clothes in tip-top shape. This means hanging up clothes when you can, and ironing folded clothes. If you are not sure how to iron your clothes, click here. You can also try steam pressing your clothes.\n\n\n## Plan your outfit\n\n1. Plan your outfits. One aspect of dressing nicely is taking the time to plan your outfits. This might mean planning your outfit the night before, or planning an entire week\u2019s worth of outfits at the beginning of the week; go with what works best for you. Trying to figure out a great outfit in the morning before school may make you feel a little too stressed, so take some time to consider your wardrobe and try on several different outfits that you could wear. Some girls find that trying out outfits and taking photos of the ones that they like to put in a binder can help them to decide on an outfit when they are in a rush. If you plan a last-minute outing with your friends, simply flip through the binder and pick out a pre-planned outfit.\n2. Consider the occasion you are dressing for. When planning your outfit, think about what you will be doing in that outfit. Different events call for different kinds of clothing. For instance, if you\u2019re going to school, try not to show too much skin, or wear a shirt that is too low cut. On the other hand, if you\u2019re going to the beach with your friends, wearing a summery dress and shoes you can walk through the sand with maybe the way to go. If you are not sure what would be appropriate to wear to a certain event, such as a cousin's baptism, or a job interview, don\u2019t be afraid to ask friends or family for advice.\n3. Wear clothing that makes you feel confident. When picking out your outfit, make sure that you feel good in your clothes. Ultimately, you should be dressing nicely for yourself rather than dressing for anyone else. It is important to feel comfortable and happy in the clothes that you are wearing; projecting confidence and enthusiasm will give your outfit that extra, energetic boost. Try to keep in mind that if someone only likes you when you are dressed up, that person might not have their priorities straight. First and foremost, dress the way that you want to dress.\n4. Try to avoid combining patterns. While you may be able to get away with some very subtle pattern combinations, it is generally a good idea to only have one pattern in your outfit. Clashing patterns can often make an outfit look sloppy. For instance, if you were wearing an argyle sweater, you would most likely want to avoid wearing that sweater with a striped skirt.\n5. Consider using the rule of three. If you are having trouble putting together an outfit, using the \u2018rule of three\u2019 can help you to create a quick but elegant ensemble in no time. When using the rule of three, pick out three colors: two that will be your base colors (most likely your shirt and pants or skirt) and one that will be your accent color. Your base colors could be subtler colors that go together well, such as a navy blue shirt and camel skirt. Your accent color should be a brighter color that makes the rest of your outfit pop, such as a red thin belt or a silver-laced scarf.\n6. Try to wear something extra cute at least once a week. While you may want to look nice every day of the week, throwing on an outfit that dazzles once a week can help to make you feel that much more well-dressed. Take the time to come up with this eye-catching ensemble.\n7. Try to avoid wearing the same outfit twice in a week. While this will not be possible if you have to wear a school uniform, or a uniform for work, try to avoid wearing the same outfit two times a week if you are planning on hanging out or being seen by the same people. If you have two different parties to go to, however, and the people at these parties won\u2019t overlap, feel free to consider wearing the same great outfit. By no means does this mean that you avoid wearing the same article of clothing twice a week. If you have a skirt that works well in two different outfits, feel free to rock both of these ensembles in the same week. Remember, mixing and matching is the key to making you feel like you have an endless wardrobe.\n8. Create an emergency outfit. Some days, you might find that you just don\u2019t want to wear the outfit you have planned. On those days, it's important to have an emergency backup outfit. This outfit should be simple, comfortable, and easy to accessorize with. For example, your emergency outfit could be a pair of nice jeans, a tank top in your favorite color, and a cropped sweater. With these basic items already put together, all you need to go is add a necklace, scarf, or rocking pair of shoes and you\u2019ll be good to go.\n\n\n## Accessorizing\n\n1. Pick out some shoes that will look classy. If you are shopping for shoes, try to pick out a couple of pairs that can be worn with most of your outfits. These could be classic black flats, a nice pair of boots, or short wedges that you can wear with your skirts and dresses. Try on the shoes and make sure you can walk in them easily; if you are planning on wearing them with many of your outfits, it\u2019s important to be able to walk in them.\n2. Wear shoes that would for the occasion. As with your clothes, consider the event you are going to when picking out the shoes you will wear that day. In certain formal events, sandals might not be appropriate, while wearing high heels at school might make it hard to get from class to class on time.\n3. Keep your shoes looking brand new. If your shoes get damaged or scuffed, try to buff the marks out, or use polishes to make your shoes look shiny and new again. Part of looking nice is being dressed well\u2014from your head to your feet. If you are not sure how to clean your shoes, take a look at some of the following articles:\n\t* Shine shoes\n\t* Polish shoes\n\t* Wash shoes\n4. Try out different kinds of jewelry. Accessorizing can help to take your outfit to a whole new level. When creating outfits for yourself, try on different kinds of jewelry and see how they change or affect the outfit you are wearing. Sometimes, adding a statement necklace or chandelier earrings can take your outfit from nice to outstanding. However, try not to over-accessorize. For example, if you are planning on wearing a chunky necklace, try wearing a small pair of stud earrings, rather than a pair of dangling earrings that could make your jewelry feel overbearing.\n5. Consider where you want the focus to be when accessorizing. Jewelry can draw a person\u2019s eye, which can be both a great thing and an unwanted thing. For example, if you want your focus to be on your face, wear large or dangling earrings. If you want the focus to be on the rest of your outfit, consider wearing a longer necklace that ties your whole outfit together. However, if you are wearing a low-cut shirt, try to refrain from wearing a longer necklace, as it might draw too much attention to your chest area.\n6. Try out different kinds of accessories. Accessories are not just limited to jewelry and shoes. You can spice up an outfit by adding an accent scarf, a colorful belt, or a stylish hat. Play around with different kinds of accessories that fit into your style.\n7. Create your own \u2018golden rule\u2019. The \u2018golden rule\u2019 refers to the maximum number of accessories you will allow yourself. This is completely based on your own opinion. Some people like to layer necklaces and wear funky shoes. Others, prefer a chic minimalist style in which you choose one or two accessories that compliment your outfit. Remember that you can change your golden rule when you feel like it doesn\u2019t reflect your personality anymore. For instance, maybe you like wearing three necklaces and a bunch of bracelets, but during the year your preferences chance and you decide to limit yourself to three accessories; go with what will make you feel happy and confident.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A fashion-conscious individual, possibly a young woman, seeking advice on improving her daily outfit choices to appear more stylish and confident.

If you\u2019re having a hard time finding the valves, follow the water lines. For example, find where the main water line enters your home. Follow it to the water meter and the shut-off valve. The main shut-off valve can vary. It could be a colored wheel that you rotate or a handle that you position horizontally to stop the water flow. It may also be outside of your home.\n3. Open the faucet to release any water still inside it. Go back to the faucet you are replacing and activate it. If the water has been shut off, it won\u2019t shoot out its normal jet of water. Instead, any water trapped in the line will spill out. Wait until the faucet stops gurgling and dripping before attempting to replace the cartridge. Draining the line won\u2019t take long. The lines can\u2019t store much water, so they clear within several seconds.\n4. Cover the drain to prevent anything from falling down it. Faucets have some small screws and other parts that could cause a lot of unnecessary hassle if they were to get lost. To prevent accidents, fit the drain\u2019s plug into place. If it doesn\u2019t have a plug, place a towel over it. Make sure the drain is completely covered. Anything that falls down the drain will be difficult to remove and could damage your plumbing. If you happen to lose a part, order a replacement online or from a hardware store.\n\n\n## Handle a sink faucet\n\n1. Pry off the faucet cap with a flathead screwdriver. The decorative cap is at the very top of the faucet stem. Find the bottom edge of the cap, then slide the tip of the screwdriver underneath it. Push the cap up until it pops off the faucet. If the cap is stuck, pry it at a few different angles. Keep working around the edges until it is loose enough to lift off the faucet. Note that every handle is separate. If your faucet has separate cold and hot water handles, they have their own cartridges. Single-handle faucets only have one cartridge.\n2. Unscrew the handle with a Phillips screwdriver. Check the top of the faucet. There will be a small hole in the center where the cap was. Stick a small Phillips screwdriver into the hole to reach the screw, then turn it counterclockwise until you are able to remove it. Pull the faucet handles off afterward. Some faucets open with an Allen wrench instead. If the screw has a hexagonal opening on top, use an Allen wrench.\n3. Remove the nut on the faucet with a crescent wrench. Removing the handle exposes a circular metal nut on the base of the faucet. Clamp the wrench around the nut, then turn it counterclockwise. Once the nut comes loose, you can finish turning it by hand. Continue rotating it until you\u2019re able to lift it off of the faucet. You could also use pliers to remove the nut. Water pump pliers are designed for dealing with plumbing nuts and bolts, but you may be able to remove it with different tools.\n4. Pull the cartridge out of the faucet by hand. The only thing left in the faucet is the cartridge. It has a wide base with a metal or plastic column in the center. You can use the column to get a grip on the cartridge. Just pull it straight up from the faucet to remove it. The old cartridge can be thrown out in the trash. Cartridges have traditionally been made of brass, recognizable because of its dull yellow coloring. Your faucet may have a silvery cartridge made of chrome or zinc, or a white one made of plastic. If you\u2019re having a hard time holding onto the cartridge, grab it with pliers. Needle nose pliers are great for such delicate work.\n5. Insert the new cartridge into the faucet stem. The new cartridge won\u2019t fit unless it aligns with the stem slot properly. Check the bottom edge of the cartridge for a small tab. The inner part of the faucet stem will have a matching slot. Simply align the tab with the slot and slide the cartridge in to install it. Make sure the new cartridge is properly aligned with the opening so it you don\u2019t inadvertently damage it. Handle it with care!\n6. Reassemble the remaining handle parts to finish the installation. Put the parts back in reverse order. Start with the nut, tightening it by rotating it clockwise with a wrench once it\u2019s on the faucet stem. Place the handle on top of it, inserting and tightening its screw with a Phillips screwdriver. Finish by pressing the cap onto the top of the handle. If your faucet is connected to multiple handles, remember to replace the cartridge in the other handle as well if necessary. Once you have finished, reactivate the water line to test out the new cartridge!\n\n\n## Fix a shower faucet\n\n1. Unscrew the shower handle with a Phillips screwdriver. Rotate the handle until you spot a small opening with a screw inside. Turn the screw counterclockwise until you\u2019re able to remove it. Once the screw is gone, the handle won\u2019t have anything holding it to the wall. Slide it off the wall and set it aside. The cartridge is located behind the handle, so you won\u2019t be able to reach it without removing the handle first. Some shower handles have alternative types of screws. You may need an Allen wrench instead of a Phillips screwdriver.\n2. Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the handle adapter. The handle is held in place by a round plate with an adapter in the middle. In the center of the adapter, you will see a screw. Turn the screw counterclockwise until you\u2019re able to remove it. Then, slide the adapter forward to detach it from the faceplate. Sometimes the adapter can be removed by twisting it off. It depends on the model, but, if you don\u2019t see a screw, you most likely have to twist it off. Note that you may need to remove the faceplate in some cases. It usually isn\u2019t necessary, but every cartridge system is a little different. If you don\u2019t see the cartridge, check the faceplate to see if it can be unscrewed too.\n3. Slip off the stem cover and anything else in front of the cartridge. Removing the adapter will reveal a small metal cylinder in the center of the wall opening. However, many shower cartridge systems have a few extra layers of protection around it. Yours may have a white plastic cap, followed by a metal ring. Pull both of them off the cartridge by hand and set them aside. These components are for adjusting and limiting the water temperature. They aren\u2019t present in all faucet models, but save them if you have them.\n4. Use pliers to pull out the clip holding the cartridge in place. Look along the top edge of the cartridge for the clip. It is usually made of steel and situated in a groove on the cartridge. Reach in with a pair of needle nose pliers, then lift it to pop it out of the slot. Pull it toward you to remove it, then dispose of it in the trash. Some faucets have a nut instead of a clip. If you see a ring around the cartridge but no clip, use pliers or a wrench to turn the nut counterclockwise. Once it comes loose, slide it off the wall.\n5. Remove the cartridge by gripping it with a pair of pliers. Once everything else is out of the way, the cartridge isn\u2019t tough to remove. Grip the stem, then attempt to pull it toward you. If it doesn\u2019t come out right away, take a closer look at it. Some cartridges have to be rotated slightly to align with a slot in the wall before they can be removed. The cartridge is recognizable because of its column-like stem jutting out from the wall. The cartridge\u2019s base is round and fits inside the wall opening. The cartridge is usually made of brass, which has a yellow coloring. Some cartridges are made of silvery steel or white plastic instead.\n6. Install the new cartridge by aligning it with the wall opening. Check the cartridge stem to see if it has a notch on it. If the notch is present, align it with the groove in the wall slot. Then, slide the cartridge in with pliers or a wrench. Make sure it is plugged all the way in before putting anything else on top of it. If the new cartridge came with a packet of grease, rub it onto the cartridge before putting it back. The grease protects the cartridge from damage during the installation. You could also apply your own plumber\u2019s grease to it.\n7. Replace the remaining parts to finish the installation. Replace the parts one by one in reverse order from how you took them out. Start with the retaining clip or nut, tightening it after putting it back. Return any stem coverings next, followed by the screw-on handle adapter. When you\u2019re done, add the handle and screw it into place. Test the faucet afterward. If it doesn\u2019t seem to be working the way you want, check all of the parts to ensure they are undamaged and have been put back correctly.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A homeowner or DIY enthusiast who is looking to fix a minor plumbing issue at their residence.

When trees mature and are harvested for wood that's used in construction, then the captured carbon dioxide is stored for a long time (until the wood decomposes or is burned). However, if no trees are replanted after harvesting this will have had a one-time effect only. Also when wood is burned (for energy or in a wild fire), or if trees die quickly and decompose, then their captured carbon is released again. Of course all trees die eventually even when they are not harvested, this is part of the natural cycle, but a mature forest can store a lot more carbon than a young, newly-planted forest so it's important to keep a forest intact as much as possible.\n\n* The wrong type(s) of trees are planted in the wrong location.\nIn the past there were bad offsetting schemes that planted non-native trees, or planted trees in a location where they would change water flows  and thus change local ecosystems in a negative way. Some offsetting schemes planted  thousands of trees of the same species, resulting in a large monoculture. Such a monoculture hinders biodiversity, is susceptible to diseases and can even damage local communities.\nThere have also been reports that planting trees above a certain latitude can have a net warming effect by changing the albedo and trapping heat. \n\n* Buying offsets reduces the incentive for people to reduce their emissions.\nReducing emissions is much more effective than offsetting. Buying carbon offsets can lead to people thinking they are doing the right thing, whereas they had better spent their time and effort in reducing their emissions. Of course this point goes for all offsetting-schemes and is not specifically for planting trees.\n\n* There are more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions than planting trees.\nNowadays many offsetting schemes invest in development of renewable energy sources (in developing countries) instead of planting trees, simply because it is a more effective and cheaper way to reduce emissions."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "an environmentalist, researcher, or policy maker with a focus on climate change mitigation and sustainable practices.

In particular, it occurs at much lower temperatures and at a much lower rate. A cubic metre of material in the solar core is only releasing around 250\u00a0W of power by fusion.\nThe fusion rate is set by the temperature (and to a lesser extent, density) of the core. This in turn is set by the need for a pressure gradient to balance the weight of material pressing down on it from above. At 15 million kelvin (the core temperature, which is much lower than the temperatures in nuclear bombs or fusion reactors), the average proton has a lifetime of several billion years before being converted (with three others) into a helium nucleus. There are two reasons this is slow. First, you have to get protons, which repel each other electromagnetically, close enough together to feel the strong nuclear force. This is why high temperatures are needed. Second, because the diproton is unstable, one of the protons needs to change into a neutron via a weak force interaction, whilst it is in the unstable diproton state, to form a deuterium nucleus. This is just inherently unlikely and means the overall reaction chain to helium is very slow.\nThe reason there is no bomb-like explosion is because there is no problem in shifting 250\u00a0W per cubic metre away from the core, in the same way that a compost heap, which generates about the same power density, does not spontaneously explode. In the case of a star any additional heat goes into more radiation that diffuses away and in work done in expanding the star. As a result, the temperature of the core is stable.  Ultimately, any additional energy emerges as sunlight at the solar photosphere.\nIf for some reason, the opacity to radiation in the core increased, then the temperature would rise and more energy would be generated by fusion.

That means a country which exports lots of goods wants to devalue their currency while a country which imports lots of goods does not.\nIn 2016, Turkey imported goods worth US $186 billion and exported goods worth US $156 billion. That means they had a trade deficit of 19%.\nHowever, China only imported goods worth US $1.23 trillion and exported goods worth US $2.27 trillion in 2016.

{"conversations": ["How to make a cat tree?", "Cats are natural climbers, and will happily crawl all over tall structures. A homemade cat tree will provide your kitty with hours of entertainment, and can be built at a fraction of the cost of cat trees available at a pet store. With some tools and dedication, you can make a customized cat tree based on your cat's personality!\n\n## Build a cat tree from wood and carpet\n\n1. Design your cat tree. Before purchasing materials or starting to build, you need a design plan, which you can sketch out on a piece of paper to determine your materials shopping list. There are several things to consider when designing your cat tree. First, consider your space limitations. Determine where your cat tree will be placed, and what size will fit well into that space. It's a good idea to take measurements to ensure your finished product will fit the space. You should also consider your cat's personality. If your cat likes to climb, consider building a tall cat tree with several perches. If your cat would like a private place to hide or sleep, consider building in a covered sleeping nook. Finally, you should keep your carpentry skills in mind. If you are relatively inexperienced with building things and using tools, keep your design simple so that you aren't overwhelmed. If you're at a loss for where to begin, there are several websites that have pictures of do-it-yourself cat trees you can use for inspiration, or even patterns for cat trees other people have made.\n2. Buy your materials. Use your design plan to determine which materials you will need. Plywood works well for horizontal platforms; dimensional lumber and cardboard or PVC pipe work well for vertical supports, and carpet is ideal for covering the wood. You may also need the following tools to assemble your tree:\n\t* A drill and some wood screws\n\t* An electric stapler\n\t* A table saw and a handsaw\n\t* A Hammer and nails\n\t* A carpet or utility knife\n\t* Wood glue or another powerful adhesive\n\t* If you want to create covered areas for your cat to perch, you may also want to pick up a concrete form tube. These heavy-duty cardboard tubes make great perches and tunnels for cats. These can also be cut lengthwise using a utility knife to create concave platforms or open-topped beds for your cat.\n3. Cut all materials to size. Using your plan as a guide, cut all the plywood and lumber sections to size. A simple hand saw works well for cutting dimensional lumber, while a handheld circular saw or table saw is better for cutting sheets of plywood. Sand rough edges if desired.\n4. Build the base of your cat tree. The tree needs a sturdy base, which should extend farther out from the center than any other platform or component of the tree in order to prevent tipping. To make the base, a good option is to cut 2 squares of plywood to size and glue them together for extra thickness. A 24\" (60 cm) square works well for a basic cat tree, but the taller your tree, the larger you'll want to make the base, to ensure it is sturdy.\n5. Cover the base in carpet. Before attaching any vertical supports, it's best to cover the base with carpet or a thick upholstery fabric. Cut the carpet to size, making it a few inches larger than the base on all sides. Then, wrap its edges over the edges of the plywood base, and staple it in place on the underside of the base with a staple gun. You may need to cut small notches in the carpet at the corners to make it fold neatly beneath the base.\n6. Attach the vertical supports to the base. The vertical supports that will hold up your platforms can be attached to the base with screws, nails, bolts or wood glue. Flip the base over so the carpeted side is face down. Then, drill holes through the underside of the base in the spots where you want the supports to be. Attach the supports by inserting screws or nails through the holes and driving them into the supports. You may want to cover the supports with carpet before attaching them, as this will be easier than doing it after they are already secured in place. To make your cat tree double as a scratching post, wrap one or more of the supports in sisal rope, securing each end with wire brads or staples, placed where they will be out view and won't be scratched by the cat. If you use staples, you may need to tap them down with a hammer to make sure they don't stick out too much.\n7. Attach the horizontal perches to the supports. The plywood perches can be attached using wood screws and/or gluing them to the tops of the vertical members. Wrap them in carpet or fabric after affixing them, so that the screws aren't visible through the carpet, and staple the carpet in place on the underside as you did with the base.\n8. Continue building according to your design. Continue to affix each component, referring back to your plan for measurements and placement. Adjustments to your design can be made as you go to account for stability issues, new ideas, or incorrect measurements.\n\n\n## Build a cat tree from a ladder\n\n1. Obtain a ladder. For this simple, unique cat tree, you'll need an old wooden ladder. Look around at garage sales, thrift furniture stores, and antique stores for one 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2 m) high. Choose an old-fashioned ladder that looks like an upside-down \"v\" with several steps on either side that are at matching levels. It's fine if the wood looks old, but make sure the foundation of the ladder isn't too rickety. You want to be certain your cat tree won't tip over and hurt your cat. Try to find a ladder that's around four feet tall. A very tall ladder my be less stable or too tall for your cat.\n2. Gather your supplies. The ladder is going to be the base of the tree, but you'll need to alter it a bit to make it more cat friendly. Gather these supplies:\n\t* A piece of plywood long and wide enough to rest on two rungs of the ladder at the same level. This will provide a platform for your cat. If you want more than one platform, you'll need more than one piece of plywood. A hammer and 2\" nails\n\t* Carpet\n\t* An electric staple gun\n\t* A piece of canvas, denim, or other sturdy fabric you can use to create a hammock between the two bottom rungs\n\t* A can of paint (optional)\n\t* A toy that hangs from a piece of rope or string\n\t* Sisal rope to wrap around the legs of the ladder\n3. Sand and paint your ladder and wood pieces. Use fine-grain sandpaper to sand down the ladder and remove any jagged edges or splinters. Do the same to the pieces of plywood you bought. Paint the ladder and plywood pieces with a coat or two of paint, if you're using it. Let the paint dry completely. Use your imagination when it comes time to paint. You could just paint the ladder to match your existing decor. But you could also paint it brown and green to make it look like a tree, or use stencils to make designs up and down the sides. Instead of painting the platforms, you can make them more comfortable for you cat by covering them in carpet, attaching it to to the platforms after nailing them into place. Use your staple gun and affix the carpet with staples in the perimeter and in the center. Make sure they don't stick up from the platform, tapping them down with a hammer if necessary.\n4. Nail the plywood platforms to the ladder. Position the first piece of plywood so that it is lined up across two ladder rungs of equal height. Use the hammer and four nails to nail the plywood into the wooden rungs, placing one nail in each corner of the plywood. Make sure the platforms are very secure when you're finished nailing them down. You may wish to use more nails, or substitute wood screws for a firmer hold. If you have a second piece of plywood to create another level, use the same procedure to nail it down.\n5. Install the hammock. Many cats enjoy sleeping in hammocks. If you'd like to add one to your cat tree, measure and cut your piece of cloth so that its four corners stretch between the four legs of the ladder. Nail or staple a corner of the fabric to the inside of each leg, making sure that the nails are all at the exact same height. Be sure the fabric you use for the hammock is thick enough to hold the weight of your cat. You can double the fabric or hem the edges before nailing it down to make it sturdier. Fabric that stretches a little is ideal for cat hammocks. Make sure nails or staples do not protrude in such a way that your cat could be scratched or cut. Tap your staples with hammer if necessary. Instead of a hammock, you can also use a carpeted concrete form tube, fastened to the ladder by attaching it to two 2X4 pieces of lumber secured to the base of the ladder with bolts, nails, or screws, between the legs. This will make your cat tree less portable, but also sturdier.\n6. Wrap the ladder legs in rope. If you want the cat tree to double as a scratching post, you can wrap the bottom of the ladder legs in strong, coarse rope. Cut the rope in four pieces. Use staples to secure the end of the first piece of rope to the inside of the base of one of the legs. Wrap the leg tightly with rope, tapping it down with a hammer if necessary. Secure the other end with a staple, making sure it is away from any areas the cat is most likely to scratch often. Repeat with the other four legs. If you want to, you can cover the legs entirely with rope, from top to bottom, using a new piece of rope between each rung of the ladder. This will allow your cat access to a scratchable surface nearly anywhere on its new cat tree.\n7. Finish up. Hang the toy you bought from the top of the ladder, somewhere the cat will be able to reach it, so as to entice your cat to come and play. Add any other finishing touches you want to make your cat tree unique and fun for your cat.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A creative and environmentally-conscious individual who enjoys crafting and upcycling household items.

When trees mature and are harvested for wood that's used in construction, then the captured carbon dioxide is stored for a long time (until the wood decomposes or is burned). However, if no trees are replanted after harvesting this will have had a one-time effect only. Also when wood is burned (for energy or in a wild fire), or if trees die quickly and decompose, then their captured carbon is released again. Of course all trees die eventually even when they are not harvested, this is part of the natural cycle, but a mature forest can store a lot more carbon than a young, newly-planted forest so it's important to keep a forest intact as much as possible.\n\n* The wrong type(s) of trees are planted in the wrong location.\nIn the past there were bad offsetting schemes that planted non-native trees, or planted trees in a location where they would change water flows  and thus change local ecosystems in a negative way.

Such a monoculture hinders biodiversity, is susceptible to diseases and can even damage local communities.\nThere have also been reports that planting trees above a certain latitude can have a net warming effect by changing the albedo and trapping heat. \n\n* Buying offsets reduces the incentive for people to reduce their emissions.\nReducing emissions is much more effective than offsetting. Buying carbon offsets can lead to people thinking they are doing the right thing, whereas they had better spent their time and effort in reducing their emissions. Of course this point goes for all offsetting-schemes and is not specifically for planting trees.\n\n* There are more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions than planting trees.\nNowadays many offsetting schemes invest in development of renewable energy sources (in developing countries) instead of planting trees, simply because it is a more effective and cheaper way to reduce emissions."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "an environmentalist, researcher, or policy maker with a focus on climate change mitigation and sustainable practices.

{"conversations": ["How to read gel electrophoresis bands?", "## View your sample\n\n1. Hold a UV light up to the gel sheet to reveal results. With your gel sheet in front of you, find the switch on a tube of UV light to turn it on. Hold the UV light 8\u201316 inches (20\u201341 cm) away from the gel sheet. illuminate the DNA samples with the UV light to activate the gel and read the results. If the test was performed properly, your sheet should have 2-8 sets of vertical stripes in parallel rows.Warning: Wear gloves and protective eyewear when physically handling a gel sample. Touching the gel can interfere with your results and some of the gels are harmful if they get in your eyes. Place the gel sheet on a piece of wax paper if you\u2019re removing it from the machine. The individual stripes indicate specific strands of DNA. The strips should have varying levels of thickness. If you\u2019re reading results that have been printed on a sheet of paper, you can skip this step.\n2. Find the wells by looking for the biggest pools of color. To properly orient yourself, you need to find the original location of the samples, called the wells. With your sheet in front of you, look for the end of the sheet with a big pool of colored gel. The wells are the locations where the gel samples are loaded into the sheet and indicate the start of the sample.There should be one well for each of your samples. If one of the wells is lacking color, the sample may have been applied poorly. The wells indicate the negative end of the sheet. The opposite side of the sheet is the positive end. When each sample is applied to the sheet, the negatively-charged DNA travels across the sheet to the opposite side, leaving individual samples of DNA behind as it moves.\n3. Classify each strip by noting the origin of the samples. If you\u2019ve been given a key, understand that each horizontal row depicts a unique set of DNA. Use your key to determine what each row represents. The number of samples can be determined by counting the number of rows. If you haven\u2019t been given a key, you cannot determine the source of each sample. Electrophoresis only provides you with information about a DNA sample\u2019s behavior, but it doesn\u2019t reveal the source of a sample on its own.If you performed the test yourself, write down where each row\u2019s sample is from while you\u2019re applying the gel.\n4. Identify the DNA ladder to establish a scale for the DNA. Depending on whether or not a DNA ladder was included in the test, you may have one strip designed to provide you with a scale to make comparisons easier. This scale is called the DNA ladder. The DNA ladder will contain strips of DNA of known sizes to make it easier to figure out how big or small the other strips are.Actual DNA samples will have a lot of variation in the sequence of the strips. There may be a few thin strips, followed by 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of empty space, followed by thick strips, and ending in more thin strips. The DNA ladder will make it easier to figure out how big the individual strips actually are by giving you something to compare them to. The DNA ladder is almost always placed in the last row at the top or bottom of your sheet.\n\n\n## Assess the size of the sample\n\n1. Identify thinner strips to find the faster DNA molecules. When each sample is applied, it starts moving to the positive end of the sheet on the right. The smaller the molecules are, the faster they move since they experience less resistance. A smaller and faster DNA sample leaves thinner strips behind as it moves. When looking at your results, determine which DNA samples are smaller and faster by looking for the thinnest strips.\n2. Find the thicker strips to find the slower DNA. Samples with larger molecules naturally move slower through the gel. As a result, you can find the bigger or slower molecules by looking for the biggest strips on your page. Looking at the frequency of the bigger and smaller strips as they appear in a single row you a good picture of the sample\u2019s DNA fingerprint.The way individual strips are arranged in a sequence is unique to each genetic sample. The combination of thin and thick strips creates a specific picture of someone\u2019s genetic makeup. DNA isn\u2019t stronger or better if it leaves thicker bands behind. These strips are simply identifying markers that you can use to compare a variety of samples.\n3. Use the DNA ladder to determine the size of each strip. The DNA ladder is used to give you a scale to compare the individual strips to. The size of the strips in a DNA ladder depend upon the type of ladder that was used for the test, but it will typically be either 10-100 bp (base pairs), or 500-1000 bp. The thickest strip is the highest size in a spectrum and the smallest size is the lowest. So for a 10-100 bp ladder, the thickest strip is 100 bp, and the thinnest strip is 10 bp.Tip: The range of a DNA ladder is printed on the bottle that the ladder came in. It may also be listed on the key if you were given one. There is no way to determine the range of a ladder based on the strip alone, since different gels will allow samples to travel at different speeds. 1000 bp is the same as 1 kb. Kb is short for kilobase, and the ladder may use this unit instead of bp. The smaller the scale is, the more accurate the comparisons will be. Base pairs and kilobases are simply units of measurement. They refer to the physical size of a DNA molecule.\n\n\n## Make conclusions\n\n1. Look for strips that appear at the same point on the sheet to find similarities. When looking at the sheet holistically, look for points where 2 or more strips appear in identical locations on different rows. This is an indicator that the DNA samples are somehow related. If there are 2 or more rows without any overlap in the sequence, they are entirely unrelated. The more related 2 samples are, the more overlap there will be in their sequences.In other words, if you\u2019re looking at the sheet with the wells on the left, you\u2019re looking for vertical columns where 2 strips appear at the same time. For example, a mother and her child will have half of their strips overlapping. A child and their second cousins though may only have 2-3 strips that overlap.\n2. Identify identical samples by finding strips with the same configuration. If 2 or more samples have a nearly identical sequence of strips, they\u2019re the same DNA. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the source of the sample is the same\u2014identical twins, for example, will have the same DNA sequence on an electrophoresis sheet. Identical strips are usually required to reasonably tie a suspect to a crime scene.Tip: Electrophoresis is often used by forensics teams to rule out suspects in criminal cases. It is also used to test maternity or paternity.\n3. Understand the limitations of electrophoresis testing. Electrophoresis testing is helpful when it comes to comparing DNA samples, but it can be hard to make definitive conclusions sometimes. The scale can only get so magnified, and smearing can make bands hard to interpret. In some instances, you won\u2019t be able to conclusively say that 2 samples are related.More than 2 overlapping bands indicates a strong similarity between 2 samples. When assessing results, scientists will often say that there is a \u201chigh probability\u201d that 2 samples are related if less than half of the bands in 2 samples overlap.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A scientist, researcher, or student specializing in molecular biology, genetics, or biochemistry.

Grammatical words that don't have any meaning on their own (function words?) like have to, going to (not present continuous), has, is, was, will etc., are highly susceptible to these sound changes. For instance, have to is often pronounced hafta, trying to is pronounced tryna, want to is wanna etc etc. The same thing happened to the phrase I'm going to.\n\nThere are a few processes involved in the reduction of I'm going to to ima.\n\n* I'm going to \u2192 I'm gonna: the consonant t is often dropped in many other clusters and grammatical constructions as well (as in tryna, wanna etc). Here it's dropped and the vowel of to\u2014which is usually a schwa [\u0259]\u2014is linked with the preceding word; going to \u2192 gonna: [\u02c8\u0261\u0259\u028a\u026a\u0303\u014bt\u0259] \u2192 [\u02c8g\u0259\u0303n\u0259]\n\n* Deletion of the /g/: plosives (/g t d k/ etc) require great effort to articulate (the air is completely blocked and then released), so people dropped the plosive /g/ to make its articulation easier: [a\u026a\u0303m g\u0259\u0303n\u0259] \u2192 [a\u026a\u0303m \u0259\u0303n\u0259] (i'm ana)\n\n* linking I'm and gonna: In causal and connected speech, consonants and vowels are often linked by a process called liaison, so both I'm and gonna join together and become [a\u026a\u0303m\u0259\u0303n\u0259] (i'mana).\n\n* Syncope of the vowel in the second syllable: Unstressed schwas are often lost through syncope (for example, 'chocolate' is choc.late for most speakers).

{"conversations": ["How to buy school supplies?", "Shopping for school supplies can be stressful for both the seasoned shopper and the beginner. Working parents or guardians have to fight the crowds that gather on weekends or after the end of the workday. Even worse, the cost of school supplies steadily increases every year, costing families an average of just under $100 in 2015. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to stress out or go bankrupt. By spacing out your purchases and practicing a few money-saving hacks, you can survive the back-to-school madness.\n\n## Buy basic supply\n\n1. Get a list from your child\u2019s school. Don\u2019t rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isn\u2019t available on the school\u2019s website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites.\n2. Know the difference between requests and requirements. Before you panic over the long supply list on the school\u2019s website, realize that many of the items are merely requests. One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.\n3. Purchase writing supplies. Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper. Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art. Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but it\u2019s always a good idea to check the supply list in case your child\u2019s teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners. Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.\n4. Buy folders. Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc. ).\n5. Purchase a day planner. Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.\n6. Buy art supplies. Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.\n7. Purchase personal supplies. Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack. Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.\n8. Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag. Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time. However, textbooks haven\u2019t gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.\n\n\n## Shop for electronics\n\n1. Buy a calculator. High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:\n\t* Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30. Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.\n2. Purchase a computer. High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list. Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget.\n3. Buy external storage. Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.\n\n\n## Save money\n\n1. Sort out what you already have. Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldn\u2019t mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s). Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt. Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.\n2. Stick to basics and generics. Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Don\u2019t worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs.\n3. Take advantage of discounts. Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back. Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.\n4. Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks. Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.\n5. Buy refurbished. Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost.

This won't affect the maximum speed of your connection, but it would cause some latency. pjc50 points out that it's about a nanosecond for every foot of cable length, which is a good rule of thumb used by many engineers when developing systems which are very dependent on latencies on those timescales.\n\nIn reality, you will never notice a difference.

In fact, nearly every step of the way involves delays which are more extreme than those seen from signal propagation. For example, most consumer grade routers will wait for the last byte of an incoming packet to be received and check it for errors before sending the first byte of the packet on its way.

When food grows scarce, hunger strikes, and humans either start fighting for what's left, reducing population to more manageable levels, or migrate to not yet depleted lands - only cases of actual extinction are from island civilizations which cannot readily move. Meanwhile, globally environment stays balanced, and depleted spots are replenished from outside - slowly healing the damage.

Even large members such as arms and legs are often survivable because the body is very good at protecting itself from blood loss. For example, transected arteries will spasm and clamp off blood flow, and loss of blood will cause the body to divert blood flow away from the extremities and to the vital organs, thereby slowing the bleeding and allowing it to clot. In fact, the whole shock process can be viewed as a set of defensive measures by the body to ensure survival in the face of serious injury. This was a bitter lesson learned by emergency medicine only fairly recently. The standard practice used to be to infuse hypovolemic patients with fluids to maintain normal blood pressure.

{"conversations": ["How to kill a fly?", "Flies can be annoying pests, especially inside your home. If you can\u2019t remove the flies humanely, you may want to kill them. Use a flyswatter for an easy way to kill a few lone flies. Try using sprays to get rid of numerous flies. You can also kill flies with bait and traps, like fly tape, DIY traps, or Venus fly traps. Eliminating flies can be done quickly, easily, and cheaply, whether you have a single fly or dozens to remove.\n\n## Use a flyswatter\n\n1. Wait for the fly to land. Keep your eye on the fly until it lands, then get ready to make your move. Approach the fly silently and slowly so it doesn't fly away. If you don\u2019t have a flyswatter, you can use other objects with a flat surface, like a newspaper, shoe, or book.\n2. Swat the fly with a quick, downward motion. Raise your flyswatter above your head, and bring it down over the fly in a single, strong move. You are crushing the fly between your flyswatter and a hard surface. If you miss the fly the first time, wait for it to land and swat again.\n3. Wipe up the fly and clean off your flyswatter. Rinse the flyswatter in soap and water, and use a tissue or paper towel to wipe up the mess. Make sure to wash your hands! You can also disinfect with a cleaning solution to prevent spreading any germs.\n4. Try using an electric flyswatter for an easier, efficient option. Electric flyswatters are devices that lure in flies with a light and kill them upon contact. Stand near the fly with your electric flyswatter to kill it effortlessly and quickly. Be sure to read over instructions carefully before use. Avoid touching the racket area, and always let the flyswatter fully cool down before storing it.\n\n\n## Spray the fly\n\n1. Choose from either chemical sprays, household cleaners, or hairspray. Chemical sprays kill flies instantly upon contact, though they contain harsh chemicals. You can also spray the flies with household cleaners, like Windex or Formula 409, or with an aerosol like hairspray. All of these sprays will help you kill a fly. Purchase chemical fly sprays at home supply stores. Look for brands like Hot Shot and Raid. Use spray if you want to remove many flies very quickly. Chemical sprays will kill them the fastest, though they have harmful chemicals. Household cleaners are a cheaper alternative, and you likely have them at home already.\n2. Spray the air near the fly thoroughly. Spray the fly while it is in the air or when the fly lands. Hold in the trigger to release the spray, and spray directly into the air around the fly. You want to saturate the fly in the spray. If you are using chemical sprays, the fly will die instantly. If you are using household cleaners or hairspray, the spray will coat the fly's wings, making it impossible to fly. The fly will still die, just not as quickly as with chemicals.\n3. Leave the room after you spray any hazardous chemical. The chemicals contained in most fly sprays are toxic and lethal. Household cleaners also use chemicals, though not quite as toxic. Avoid inhaling these chemicals by leaving the room immediately after you spray. Leave the room for both chemical sprays and household cleaners. If you have pets or children, they should also avoid the room until the chemicals have settled. You can wait about an hour before reentering the room, so the chemicals can dissipate. This will depend on how ventilated your room is and how much chemical you spray. It is safe to come back into the room when you no longer smell the chemicals.\n4. Dispose of the dead fly and wash your hands. Scoop up the dead flies with a paper towel or tissue, and throw them in the trash can. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water! If you killed multiple flies, throw them all away before you wash your hands.\n\n\n## Remove fly with trap\n\n1. Hang fly paper in areas with many flies for a cheap and easy option. Fly papers, or fly ribbons, are strips of paper coated in a sticky attractant. Flies approach the paper because they are attracted to the smell, and they get stuck to the paper and die. You can hang fly paper near your entrances, above your windows, or next to your trash can, for example. Fly paper can be hung up indoors or outdoors. Replace your fly paper after you collect a handful of dead flies.\n2. Make your own trap for a cost effective solution. You can make your own trap with sugar water, a jar, and a paper cone. Cut a small hole around the point of the paper cone. Pour 1 part sugar and 2 parts water into the jar, and place the cone upside down inside the jar. The flies will be attracted to the sweet smell, and once they are inside, they will get stuck and drown in the liquid. You can add a piece of cut fruit to the jar to tempt the flies further. Try a piece of apple. You can also add a mix of sugar and water to a plastic bottle instead of a jar.\n3. Set out a Venus flytrap for a natural, hands-off option. Venus flytraps are carnivorous plants that feed on insects. The flytrap has a reddish, sweet-smelling interior, which insects mistake as a flower. A fly will land inside, and the flytrap will snap shut. The fly cannot escape, and the flytrap will consume the fly. Place your flytrap in areas popular fly areas, like your kitchen or near your door. Purchase Venus flytraps at most home supply stores or garden centers.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally conscious individual, possibly a sustainability advocate or a concerned citizen.

{"conversations": ["When reading some documentation about the security of a product, I found that the vendor uses the SHA-2 of a password to encrypt data (AES-256), instead of using this password directly.\nAre there any advantages of doing so?\nAn attacker is not going to crack the encrypted data using this SHA-2-as-a-password key but rather exhaust the password keyspace (if feasible) and try its hash. Therefore the only reason I can think of is that there is an extra computational step (the creation of the hash). I would have rather increased the password entropy if the point is to computationally complexify the attack.", "It sounds like a primitive version of a key derivation function (KDF), in particular they probably could have avoided reinventing the wheel by using PBKDF2.\n\nThere are several reasons why you don't want to use the password directly as an AES key. \n\n* To distribute the bits. The main property here is that a hash function's output is, statistically speaking, uniformly distributed. People tend to pick passwords that aren't fully random, in particular, most passwords would only contain characters you can type in a keyboard. When used as an encryption key, a non-statistically random key may expose weaknesses in the encryption function.\n* To fit the keys to the encryption key length. Most passwords are going to be either longer or shorter than the key space of the encryption function. By hashing your password, the exact key length will be exactly the size of the input key of your encryption function. While the entropy of the derived key doesn't increase, this avoids the likelihood of exposing weakness in the encryption function if you just simply zero pad the password or worse truncate the password.\n* To slow down key derivation decryption. Per your description, the software is only using a single SHA256 round, which is not much. But with proper password based KDF, like PBKDF2, there are usually tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of rounds of the underlying hash function. This slows down computing the keys, increasing the effective strength of passwords without increasing its length.\n* To keep the user's plain text password out of memory, thus preventing it from being accidentally dumped to disk during hibernation or crash dump. While this wouldn't protect the hash from being used to decrypt the data you're encrypting, it will prevent the password from being reused to decrypt other files (which presumably uses different salt) or being tried on your online accounts or other devices that you use.\n"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A cybersecurity professional or a security-conscious software developer who is evaluating the security measures of a product.

{"conversations": ["How to measure a bottom bracket?", "## Remove the crankshaft\n\n1. Unscrew the bolt or nut in the middle of the crankshaft. Flip your bike upside down or put it on a bike stand. Inspect the crankshaft, which is the big gear on one side of your pedals, to find how the pedal is connected to the crank. Get a socket wrench or screwdriver that fits the nut or bolt. Unscrew this piece by turning your tool counterclockwise and set it aside.Tip: If the nut or bolt is embedded in the crank wheel, use a crank extractor tool to reach the nut or bolt. Insert it into the opening and wrap it around the nut or bolt. Then, use a wrench to turn the tool counterclockwise. You cannot access or measure a bottom bracket without moving the crankshaft. If you\u2019re measuring a bracket that is not installed on a bike, feel free to skip this section. If there is a piece of plastic sitting on top of this nut or bolt, pop it off with a flathead screwdriver. This is the dust cap. Hold the pedal arm in place while doing this to keep it from turning.\n2. Screw the crank extractor tool into the bolt in the middle of the crankshaft. Under the first nut or bolt, there will be a bolt locking the crankshaft in place. Using the threaded side of your crank extractor tool, slide your crank extractor into the opening in the crankshaft and turn it clockwise to tighten it in the threading, if necessary. On some bikes, the crankshaft won\u2019t have any threading for a crank extractor tool. On these bikes, you can simply push the crank extractor tool into the opening and wrap it around the bolt.\n3. Tighten the socket on the open end of the crank extractor tool. With the tool attached to the nut inside of the crankshaft, turn the socket at the end of the tool clockwise by hand. Once it won\u2019t move any further, use a wrench to turn it. Hold the pedal in place to keep the crankshaft in place. Continue turning the socket until it won\u2019t move any further. The socket should move closer towards the crankshaft as you turn it. If it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re turning the socket the wrong way. Turning this socket effectively pulls the side of the crankshaft off of the axle.\n4. Slide the crankshaft off of the bottom bracket. Once the pedal in your hand feels loose, simply slide the crank wheel off of the bottom bracket. The crank extractor tool will still be attached to the crankshaft, so turn the socket counterclockwise to remove it. With the crankshaft off, repeat this process on the other side to remove the remaining pedal. If the shaft doesn\u2019t slide off immediately, jiggle the crankshaft a little while pulling it out. Crankshafts can stick a little if they haven\u2019t been removed in a long time.\n\n\n## Measure the bracket\n\n1. Measure the width of the bracket\u2019s shell using calipers. Flip the bike over or set it on a bike stand if it isn\u2019t already. Inspect the area near your bike\u2019s crankshaft for a horizontal cylinder that connects to your pedals. This is the shell for your bottom bracket. Spread the jaws on your calipers out and slide them around the openings on each side of the shell. Slide the movable jaw on the calipers so that they\u2019re flush against the 2 openings of the shell. Measure your width and write down.Tip: Bottom bracket measurements are kind of confusing. For bracket dimensions, the first number is always the width of the shell. The second number is always the length of the bracket itself from spindle to spindle. Bottom bracket measurements are always taken in millimeters. The most common sizes for the width of the shell are 68 mm and 73 mm. You can use a ruler instead of calipers if you prefer. It\u2019s easier to get a precise measurement with calipers, though. To use your calipers, slide the jaws sticking out of the ruler until they\u2019re flush against 2 surfaces. The number above the hash mark on the movable jaw is your measurement. You can do this with the bracket installed on the bike or measure the bracket separately. You still need to measure a bracket\u2019s bike shell though\u2014not the bracket itself\u2014to determine whether a bracket will fit or not.\n2. Calculate the length of the bracket from spindle to spindle. Spread the jaws of your calipers out. Wrap them around the pegs that stick out of the middle of the bracket. Close the jaws so that they\u2019re flush with each exterior edge on your pegs. Write this measurement down after the width. This is the overall length of your bottom bracket. The length typically ranges from 113-122 mm. If you\u2019re replacing a bottom bracket, the length of your new bracket must match the length of your old bracket. If you\u2019re replacing the bracket and the pedals though, your bottom bracket\u2019s length must match the required bracket length of your new pedals. The spindles are the little pegs that stick out of the bottom bracket on both sides. You can do this with the bracket installed on the bike, or measure it separately. If your spindles aren\u2019t circular and have flat sides on them, you have a square-tapered bracket. This is the most common fitting type for bottom brackets and is found on basically every bicycle that isn\u2019t vintage or custom-made.\n3. Check the length from edge to edge if you don\u2019t have spindles. Some bottom brackets don\u2019t have spindles. These brackets are called thread-through brackets. For these brackets, use your calipers to measure from the exterior edge to exterior edge. These brackets are commonly found on custom bikes and newer models.\n4. Measure the inner diameter on the side of the bracket\u2019s shell. Spread the jaws on your calipers and wrap them around the side of the shell where the bracket is exposed on either side. Tighten the calipers around the opening to measure the diameter. Write this number down and label it. If the inner shell diameter is 1.37 inches (35 mm), you have an English bracket. This is the most common type of bottom bracket. On a BMX bike, this measurement will typically be either 19 mm or 22 mm. This measurement will be the same on both sides; don\u2019t bother checking the width on each side. The diameter of the bottom bracket itself is irrelevant since some bottom brackets don\u2019t sit flush on the shell. If your shell is not on the bike, you cannot determine this size without reading the instructions for the bracket.\n5. Determine what kind of bracket tool you need to check the threading. To check the threading type, you\u2019ll need to remove the bracket from the bike. Bottom bracket tools come in different sizes based on the cup holding it in place. To determine what size bottom bracket removal tool you need, count the number of notches on the outside rim of the bracket where the cup rests. The number of notches on the bracket will match the number of notches on your bottom bracket.\n6. Remove the bottom bracket using a removal tool or wrench, if necessary. Start on the bracket on the right. Slide the bottom bracket tool over the spindle and wrap a wrench around it. Turn the bracket tool counterclockwise until the cup holding the bracket in place comes out. Repeat this process by turning the bracket tool clockwise on the left. The bottom bracket will slide right out with the cups off. If the right side won\u2019t loosen when you turn counterclockwise, you probably have an Italian bracket. Try turning clockwise instead. If there are no threading whatsoever, you have a press-fit bottom bracket. To remove these brackets, use an old crankshaft or the head of a hammer to gently push the bracket out of the shell. Always start on the drive side of the bracket. The drive side is always on the right of the bike when you\u2019re sitting on it.\n7. Check the threading on the bracket to see what type you have. Some shells have threading for the bottom bracket while others do not. This means that the threading on your bottom bracket must match the threading on the shell. Inspect the direction of the threading on each end of the bracket. If both sides are installed by turning counterclockwise, you have an Italian bottom bracket. If the right-hand side is installed clockwise and the left-hand side is installed counterclockwise, you have an English bracket. If there is no threading in the shell, you have a thread-together bottom bracket and you do not need to worry about threading. The English and Italian brackets are found on the vast majority of bikes. A French bracket refers to an English bracket with smaller threading.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A bicycle mechanic or DIY enthusiast with a keen interest in bike maintenance and repair.

{"conversations": ["How to feel happy when christmas is over?", "Christmas season is filled with excitement and fun. Families come together to celebrate and exchange gifts, and decorations change the landscape of cities and towns. Once the holiday is over, however, the lack of excitement can leave you feeling down. Get back into a good mood by being thankful for your good times, planning for the next holiday or picking up a new hobby.\n\n## Be thankful\n\n1. Reflect on the holiday. When you feel sad that the holiday is over, cheer yourself up by thinking about all of the good times that you had. There are bound to be a lot of great memories from the holiday, so focus on those when you feel upset. Go through photographs from the holiday. If you're from a family that takes a lot of photographs or videos of family gatherings, look through some of them if you're feeling low after the holidays. They'll be a great reminder of all of the fun you had. Talk to the people you celebrated with. It's never to early to begin reminiscing. Speak with your friends and family members that celebrated with you and talk about the good times at Christmas. They're bound to be able to cheer you up with a funny story from the holiday.\n2. Get excited about your gifts. While gifts aren't the only good thing about the holidays, they can make make you happy when you're sad about the holiday ending. Play with toys or gadgets, read books, and make use of all of the gifts you've been given. They'll be a welcome distraction.\n3. Spend your Christmas money. If you received money or gift cards, go out and treat yourself. You'll be cheered up by new purchases, and you may be able to forget that the holiday is over. Go out to eat or visit stores for a good distraction.\n4. Write thank you notes. Send messages to the people who got you gifts and thank them for a great holiday. Not only will you be doing a good deed, but you'll be recalling memories of the times that made you happy. Use the notes to talk about how much you enjoyed the holidays, and how you can't wait to spend time together next year.\n\n\n## Plan for the next holiday\n\n1. Replace decorations. Decorations are one of the best parts of Christmas, but if you leave them up, it may make you even more sad that the holiday is over. Even worse, the empty walls left behind by decorations you've stored may make you feel even more sad. Find creative ways to redecorate your house now that the holiday is over. Buy some plants. Greenery will spruce up your home, and you'll be able to care for the plants throughout the coming spring. Buy a new poster or painting. Large Christmas decorations like wreaths or wall-hangings can be replaced with a new poster or painting. Look for something colorful and exciting to accent your home. With a new piece of art where your decorations were, you may not even notice that your wreath is gone. Put up pictures from Christmas. Replace some of your Christmas decorations with photos from the holiday. You'll have a reminder of the good times to replace the actual decorations. Decorate for winter. Winter can be a beautiful time of year if you learn to appreciate it. Decorate your home for the season with a lot of white items, vases accented with twigs, snowflake decorations and evergreen sprigs.\n2. Plan for New Year's. Christmas may be over, but New Years is right around the corner. Plan a New Years party to get into the spirit of a different holiday. Invite any family and friends that visited for Christmas and you'll get to spend more time with them.\n3. Plan for next Christmas. While it may seem a little early to be get ready for another Christmas, it may be helpful to think about what your next Christmas will be like. Make some invitations, and plan what gifts you will give to others. Your plans might change throughout the course of the year, but you'll be able to make your plans into a good distraction.\n\n\n## Pick up a new hobby\n\n1. Exercise. Exercising will put you in a much better mood and help you burn off some of the extra Christmas-food calories. Go for a jog, lift weights or play a sport with some friends. If you live in a cold climate, January might be too chilly for much outdoor activity, so look into a gym membership or indoor sports leagues.\n2. Start a new hobby. If you've received any hobby-oriented Christmas gifts like paints, kitchen utensils or a new video game, put them to use. Throwing yourself into a new hobby and learning a new skill will help take your mind off of your sadness.\n3. Volunteer. Volunteering can help you keep your Christmas spirit alive as you help those in need. Look into helping out local soup kitchens, shelters or charities that distribute winter clothes. You'll be able to help others through the winter and take your mind off of the end of the Christmas season.\n4. Try to keep a positive attitude. While it may be depressing that Christmas is over, always try to keep up a good attitude. Remember that this Christmas isn't the last one you'll ever have, and focus on things that make you happy as much as possible. It may be especially hard to keep a positive attitude if you have to go back to work. However, think of your return to work as a blank slate and new beginning.

{"conversations": ["How to cut carbon arrows?", "Carbon arrows are a lightweight alternative to aluminum, but they may not always come in the correct length you need. While you can always take the arrows into a hunting store to have them cut by a professional, you can also cut arrows at home with a rotary cutter or an arrow saw. Before you cut the arrows, be sure to measure your draw length to know how long the shafts need to be. When you\u2019re finished, your arrows will be the perfect size!\n\n## Find the proper arrow length\n\n1. Hold a tape measure out to your side with your non-dominant hand. Grip the tape measure in your nondominant hand so the tape points toward your wrist. Fully extend your nondominant arm out to your side so it\u2019s parallel to the ground to simulate holding a bow. Make sure you can easily grab and pull the tape toward you, and reposition the tape measure in your hand if you can\u2019t. Avoid using a fabric tape measure since it may give you an inaccurate measurement.\n2. Pull the tape to the corner of your mouth with your dominant hand. Grab the end of the tape with your dominant hand and slowly pull it out. Keep pulling the tape until the end touches the corner of your mouth on the dominant side of your body. For example, pull it to the right corner of your mouth if you\u2019re right-handed. Once the tape measure is fully extended, look at the measurement. Pulling the tape measure to the corner of your mouth simulates drawing a bowstring so you can get an accurate measurement for your draw length.Tip: Put your nondominant thumb on the tape measure before checking the measurement so it doesn\u2019t retract. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to measure again.\n3. Add 2 in (5.1 cm) to your measurement to find the arrow length. If your arrow is too short, it could jam your bow or cause the arrow to shoot improperly. Take the draw length measurement you just found and include an extra 2 inches (5.1 cm) to ensure that the arrows are long enough for your bow. For example, if your draw length measurement was 29 inches (74 cm), then the length of your arrow should be 31 inches (79 cm).\n4. Transfer your measurement onto the arrow shaft. Start your measuring tape at the back of the arrow shaft and extend the tape toward the front. When you reach the measurement you found, use a marker to draw a line or dot on the arrow shaft so you know where to cut. Rotate the arrow 180 degrees and make another mark in the same place to use as reference. Don\u2019t include the arrow\u2019s nock in the measurement since nock sizes vary between arrows. Start at the base of the arrow shaft instead.\n\n\n## Use a rotary cutter\n\n1. Clamp a rotary cutter horizontally over the edge of the table. A rotary cutter is a handheld multitool that spins quickly to cut through materials. Use a rotary cutter with a circular carbide blade so it can easily cut through the carbon arrows without deforming them. Lay the rotary cutter horizontally so the blade is vertical and hangs over the edge of your work surface. Use a C-clamp to secure the tool to your work surface so it doesn\u2019t shift around while you\u2019re using it. You can buy a rotary cutter from your local hardware store.Tip: Make sure you can easily access the power switch on the tool so you can turn it on and off when you need it.\n2. Position the hose of a shop vacuum behind the rotary blade. Cutting carbon arrows creates dust that can cause irritation if you breathe it in, so it\u2019s easiest to vacuum it immediately to prevent it from spreading. Set the end of the hose on your work surface so it\u2019s directly behind the rotary cutter\u2019s blade. Connect the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum. You can also use your regular vacuum if you don\u2019t have a shop vacuum available.\n3. Put on safety glasses and a face mask before turning the machines on. Carbon dust can cause irritation if it gets in your eyes or lungs, so it\u2019s important to stay protected while you work. Put on safety glasses that cover your eyes completely, and a face mask that guards your nose and mouth. Once you put on your safety equipment, you can start the rotary tool and the vacuum. Even though you have a vacuum capturing most of the dust, there still may be particles floating around.\n4. Cut the arrow along the mark you made. Once your rotary tool is spinning at full speed, carefully guide the arrow so the blade lines up with the marks you made earlier. Push the shaft gently against the blade so it cuts into the carbon. Continue pushing the arrow into the blade until it cuts completely through the other side. If the blade has difficulty cutting the arrow straight through, try rotating the arrow while you hold it against the blade to make it easier.\n\n\n## Cut shaft with an arrow saw\n\n1. Attach a shop vacuum hose to the port on the back of an arrow saw. Many arrow saws have a port on the back where you can attach a vacuum hose to collect dust. Push the end of a shop vacuum hose into the dust collection port on the arrow saw until it\u2019s secured in place. Attach the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum. You can buy arrow saws from hunting supply stores or you can order them online. Arrow saws usually cost around $130 USD. You can use your regular vacuum if you don\u2019t have access to a shop vacuum.Tip: If your arrow saw doesn\u2019t have a port for a vacuum hose, then set the hose as close to the blade as you can.\n2. Wear safety glasses and a face mask while you\u2019re cutting arrows. Carbon arrows create carbon fiber dust when you cut them, which can be irritating if you inhale it or if it gets in your eyes. Wear safety glasses that cover your eyes completely and put on a face mask to protect your mouth and nose. Once you have the face mask and safety glasses on, you can turn on your machines.\n3. Position the arrow on the saw so the back sits inside of the notch on the support. Your arrow saw will have a support with a notch on it so your arrow doesn\u2019t roll around while you\u2019re cutting it. Set the back of the arrow in the notch and line up the front of the arrow so the mark you made on the shaft lines up with the saw blade. Your arrow saw may have multiple supports on it. If so, make sure the arrow sits in all of the notches to ensure you make a straight cut.\n4. Rotate the arrow while it\u2019s against the saw blade to cut completely through it. Once your arrow saw is running at full speed, slowly push the arrow shaft into the blade. Once it starts cutting into the arrow, spin the arrow so the blade cuts around the circumference of the shaft. As soon as you around the circumference of the arrow, the end will fall off and you can turn off your saw. Your arrow saw may be powerful enough to cut through the shaft without rotating it.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an archer or bowhunter with a keen interest in sustainable practices.

{"conversations": ["How to get rid of neck acne?", "Neck acne can be as frustrating as acne on your face. The skin on your neck is thicker than the skin on your face (the acne that appears here is more like body acne than face acne) and may produce more oil, sometimes leading to more severe acne or cystic lesions. The best way to get rid of neck acne is with a good cleansing routine and an occasional skin treatment. If your acne does not improve within a few months or if it appears infected, then you should see a doctor for help.\n\n## Cleanse your neck\n\n1. Wash your neck at least twice a day. Keeping your neck clean is the best way to start getting rid of neck acne. You should take a shower to wash your neck at least once per day. If you sweat a lot, such as after a workout, then take another shower.\n2. Use a gentle cleanser to clean your neck. Find a gentle cleanser that is labeled as \u201cnon-comedogenic\u201d or \u201coil-free\u201d to use on your neck. Products that are non-comedogenic will not clog your pores so they should help to clear up your neck acne. Check the label to be sure that a product is non-comedogenic. Check to make sure that the products you buy are alcohol-free as well. Alcohol may irritate your neck acne and make it worse.\n3. Apply cleanser to your neck using only your fingers. Do not use a washcloth, sponge, or other abrasive materials to apply cleanser to your neck because this can cause irritation, scarring, and worsen the existing acne. Instead, use your fingertips to gently apply the cleanser to your neck. Do not scrub aggressively. Rinse your neck well after you finish washing it. Pat your neck dry with a clean cotton towel.\n4. Avoid irritants. You may not realize it, but your clothing or accessories may be contributing to your neck acne and making it worse. Avoid tight collared shirts, scarves, and turtlenecks, as these may irritate the acne. Make sure anything that touches your neck is clean. Also, avoid touching the area and never pick at or scratch your acne, as this can cause scarring. Try not to use oily sunscreens and don't cover the acne with foundation or makeup. If you use a hairstyling product, make sure it doesn't come in contact with your neck. If you have long hair, the oil from your hair may be getting on the back of your neck. Try wearing your hair up in a ponytail while you treat your acne.\n\n\n## Use a sea salt treatment\n\n1. Gather your ingredients. Making a sea salt treatment is easy and the ingredients are available in most grocery stores. It exfoliates your skin and can dry out acne. To make a sea salt treatment, you will need:\n\t* 1 cup hot water\n\t* 1 teaspoon sea salt\n\t* Green tea bag and/or 1 \u2013 2 tablespoons aloe vera\n2. Brew a cup of green tea. Green tea extract has been found to be effective as a treatment for acne, but using a cup of green tea as a base for this treatment should also help. You can either use one teaspoon of green tea leaves in a tea infuser or use a green tea bag. Place the tea bag or infuser into a mug. Then, boil some water and pour about 1 cup of water over the green tea. Let the tea steep for about three minutes and then remove the tea bag or infuser.\n3. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of sea salt in the tea. Measure out 1 teaspoon of sea salt and add it to the cup of tea. Stir the sea salt until it completely dissolves in the tea.\n4. Add a tablespoon of aloe vera. Aloe vera has been found to be effective against acne and it also has moisturizing properties. You can add this instead of the tea, or try combining the green tea and aloe vera into one mixture. Add 1 tablespoon of aloe vera to the sea salt solution and stir well. If you want to skip the green tea and only use aloe vera, mix 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel with 1 tablespoon of sea salt. This will make a scrub that you can apply directly to your neck.\n5. Apply the mixture to your neck. Make sure that the solution is not so hot that it might burn your neck. Allow it to cool down a bit first. Then, you can apply the solution by soaking a clean cotton washcloth in the solution and placing the cloth over your neck. If you only have few places that you want to treat, then you can dip a cotton swab or cotton ball into the solution and apply it as needed.\n6. Leave the solution on for about five minutes. Don\u2019t leave the sea salt solution on your skin any longer or it may dry out your skin too much. After time is up, rinse off your neck with lukewarm water and gently dry off your neck with a clean, cotton towel.\n7. Moisturize your neck. After the sea salt treatment, apply some moisturizer to your neck. Make sure that you use a non-comedogenic moisturizer to avoid making the acne worse.\n8. Repeat the sea salt treatment once per day. Do not use this treatment more than once per day or you may dry out your skin too much, even if you moisturize after. Limit yourself to one sea salt treatment per day.\n\n\n## Use an egg white mask\n\n1. Gather your ingredients. Some of the things you can readily find in your kitchen are thought to have antibacterial and healing properties, allowing you to quickly whip up an acne-fighting mask. You will need:\n\t* 1/2 tablespoon of dark colored honey (darker honey has more antibacterial properties)\n\t* 1 egg white (do not use the yolk)\n\t* 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice\n2. Combine the ingredients in a small bowl. Use a whisk or fork to mix the egg white and lemon juice until it becomes frothy, then add the honey. Make sure that everything is well combined. You may wish to add other household items, such as 1 teaspoon of witch hazel (which has anti-inflammatory properties) or a few drops of an essential oil like peppermint, spearmint, lavender, or calendula, but it is unclear if these will enhance or reduce the effectiveness of the treatment.\n3. Spread the paste over your neck. If you want to treat your whole neck, then you can use your fingers to spread the paste over your neck. If you want to treat a smaller area, then you can use a cotton swab or cotton ball to spread the paste over specific problem areas.\n4. Allow the paste to dry on your neck and then rinse. Leave the paste alone for about 15 minutes, then rinse it away with lukewarm water. You may need to hop in the shower to do this. Use your fingers to break up the paste as you rinse it away. Pat your skin dry and then apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer to complete the treatment.\n\n\n## Treat neck acne with medication\n\n1. Try over-the-counter treatments. Face washes and topical treatments containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, or resorcinol acid are all effective acne-fighters and are available over-the-counter. You may find products targeted specifically at treating body acne, which may be more effective than products meant to be used on your face. Just make sure you don't forget and use the body product on the delicate skin of your face or the front of your neck.\n2. Ask about retinoid creams. Retinoid creams can help to unclog your pores and eliminate acne on your neck, but you will need to get a prescription from your doctor or dermatologist.\n3. Discuss the use of antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe a prescription-strength topical antibiotic, such as clindamycin, to apply to your neck, which kills acne-causing bacteria. It may also reduce redness. You will need to apply it twice daily and combine it with benzoyl peroxide, as this prevents the bacteria from becoming immune to the antibiotic.\n4. Talk to your doctor about oral contraceptive pills if you are a woman. Oral contraceptives can help to reduce acne in some women, but only if the acne is related to shifts in your hormones. Keep in mind that oral contraceptives have side effects and they should not be used if you are planning to become pregnant.\n5. Consider steroid injections for cystic acne. If your dermatologist determines that the acne on the back of your neck is a nodular or cystic lesion, your doctor may decide to inject the lesion directly with a steroid. This can quickly reduce swelling and heal the acne. It may also reduce scarring. Side effects of this treatment include thinning of the skin, increased sensitivity to light, and may temporarily case the fat under your skin to atrophy, giving the area a \"sunken\" appearance.\n6. Consider isotretinoin for severe acne. Isotretinoin is a strong medicine that should only be used if other methods of controlling acne fail to work. Isotretinoin can clear up severe acne in a couple of months, but it also has some severe risks including:\n\t* Ulcerative colitis\n\t* Liver damage\n\t* Inflammatory bowel disease\n\t* Depression\n\t* Bone changes\n\t* Severe birth defects\n7. Look into laser treatments for acne. Laser treatments can also help to get rid of acne by reducing the size of oil glands and making them less active as well. Some forms of laser therapy also use topical medicine to make the laser more effective. Keep in mind that you will need multiple treatments in order for laser therapy to work.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned individual who is experiencing neck acne and is seeking effective solutions to manage and eliminate it.

{"conversations": ["How important is multithreading in the current software industry?", "It is extremely important.\nWhat is more important though is to understand that multithreading is just one way to solve the asynchrony problem. The technical environment in which many people are now writing software differs from the historical software development environment (of monolithic applications performing batch computations) in two key ways:\n\n* Many-core machines are now common. We can no longer expect clock speeds or transistor densities to increase by orders of magnitude. The price of computation will continue to fall, but it will fall because of lots of parallelism. We're going to have to find a way to take advantage of that power.\n* Computers are now heavily networked and modern applications rely upon being able to fetch rich information from a variety of sources.\n\nFrom a computational standpoint, these two factors essentially boil down to the same core idea: information increasingly will be available in an asynchronous fashion.

{"conversations": ["How to drive economically?", "Everyone needs to use a car from time to time, but gas can be expensive. Driving more economically can save you money and keep your car\u2019s parts from wearing quickly. By avoiding aggressive driving, managing gears and electronics, and performing regular maintenance, you can drive more economically no matter where you\u2019re going.\n\n## Avoid aggressive drive\n\n1. Brake in a controlled manner. Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you\u2019ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don\u2019t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel.\n2. Accelerate smoothly. Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money.\n3. Minimize distractions. Whether you\u2019re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions. Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It\u2019s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.\n\n\n## Manage gear and electronics\n\n1. Use air conditioning wisely. At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way.\n2. Cut down on electronics. Your car\u2019s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren\u2019t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings.\n3. Use your gears effectively. Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car\u2019s engine. To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration. While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently. Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you\u2019re new to the technique.\n\n\n## Perform routine maintenance\n\n1. Check your tire pressure regularly. Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently.\n2. Use the right specification of engine oil. Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner\u2019s manual.\n3. Get your car serviced regularly. Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.\n\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Pack light. Bringing extra luggage or hauling large items requires more gas to get your car from place to place. Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle.\n2. Map your journey. Getting lost certainly won\u2019t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you\u2019re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient.\n3. Carpool when possible. Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You\u2019ll also save your car from more wear and tear.\n4. Combine errands. Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start \u201ccold\u201d less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally-focused individual, possibly a commuter or car owner, looking for ways to minimize their environmental impact while still maintaining a budget-friendly driving experience.

{"conversations": ["How do DOS games like DOOM benefit from a PCI graphics card?", "DOOM itself doesn\u2019t do anything special to benefit from PCI graphics cards. It runs faster with PCI graphics cards (and VLB, AGP, and PCI Express cards) than with ISA graphics cards because the supporting bus is faster, so reads from and writes to video memory take less time.\nPCI goes to great lengths to preserve backwards compatibility with ISA-based VGA, providing support for \u201cVGA compatible\u201d adapters so that they can appear in memory at the same locations and use the same I/O ports as ISA VGA cards. So accesses to the VGA registers and to the VGA buffer (at 0xA0000) go directly to the main PCI VGA compatible adapter in the system, with no change required in the operating system or programs running on it. (This is the reason why there\u2019s a specific \u201cVGA compatible controller\u201d device type in PCI. Such shenanigans are impossible for other device types in PCI, which is why PCI sound cards have so much trouble providing compatibility with programs written for ISA sound cards.)\nA faster bus and/or faster video memory immediately leads to higher performance in video-intensive programs because software doesn\u2019t need to be careful about how it accesses video memory (except on CGA, and on all platforms with vertical blank synchronisation if it cares about tearing). So ```REP MOVSW``` or ```REP MOVSD``` with no waiting in software, once the program decides to write a frame, is perfectly fine, and will go faster and faster as the underlying hardware improves. On platforms where this can\u2019t work in hardware (e.g. on an 8088 with a VGA card), the hardware takes care of specifics \u2014 for example on an 8088 the bus unit will split up 16-bit accesses.\nYour question is specific to DOOM but other DOS games are in a similar situation. Later games tended to rely on VBE (often using UniVBE) to access video modes beyond those provided by VGA, but they mostly didn\u2019t use anything beyond video-mode setup and framebuffer configuration (see also Were any DOS games (or software) known to use VBE/AF?), so improved video speed came mostly from bus speed increases, faster video memory, and speed increases in the cards themselves (which was already a factor in the ISA era, compare most Trident cards to Tseng cards for example).\nFor an excellent explanation of the intricacies of VGA programming and its memory layout, see Fabien Sanglard\u2019s Game Engine Black Book series. The DOOM update loop is shown on page 185 of the DOOM book; it doesn\u2019t use any assembly language (unlike the renderer, see pp. 290 and following), but it does have one perhaps surprising feature given the 32-bit nature of the code: VGA updates are done 16 bits at a time. Section 2.3 of the same book, pp. 59 and following, describes some of the improvements to VGA adapters around the time DOOM was released, in particular the switch to the VESA Local Bus on 486s.

{"conversations": ["Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20\u00b0C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.", "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp. Perparing food outside in the cold takes a lot longer than in a heated kitchen, severly limits what you can do, and may also risk predator encounters depending on what is around your area in the winter."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A young, adventurous, and environmentally conscious individual embarking on an unconventional living experiment in Stockholm.

{"conversations": ["How to get the first item from an associative PHP array?", "PHP \nIf you don't know enough about the array (you're not sure whether the first key is foo or bar) then the array might well also be, maybe, empty.\nSo it would be best to check, especially if there is the chance that the returned value might be the boolean FALSE:\n```$value = empty($arr) ? $default : reset($arr);\n```\nThe above code uses ```reset``` and so has side effects (it resets the internal pointer of the array), so you might prefer using ```array_slice``` to quickly access a copy of the first element of the array:\n```$value = $default;\nforeach(array_slice($arr, 0, 1) as $value);\n```\n\nAssuming you want to get both the key and the value separately, you need to add the fourth parameter to ```array_slice```:\n```foreach(array_slice($arr, 0, 1, true) as $key => $value);\n```\nTo get the first item as a pair (```key => value```):\n```$item = array_slice($arr, 0, 1, true);\n```\nSimple modification to get the last item, key and value separately:\n```foreach(array_slice($arr, -1, 1, true) as $key => $value);\n```\nperformance\nIf the array is not really big, you don't actually need ```array_slice``` and can rather get a copy of the whole keys array, then get the first item:\n```$key = count($arr) ? array_keys($arr)[0] : null;\n```\nIf you have a very big array, though, the call to ```array_keys``` will require significant time and memory more than ```array_slice``` (both functions walk the array, but the latter terminates as soon as it has gathered the required number of items - which is one).\nA notable exception is when you have the first key which points to a very large and convoluted object. In that case ```array_slice``` will duplicate that first large object, while ```array_keys``` will only grab the keys.\nPHP 7.3+\nPHP 7.3 onwards implements ```array_key_first()``` as well as ```array_key_last()```. These are explicitly provided to access first and last keys efficiently without resetting the array's internal state as a side effect.\nSo since PHP 7.3 the first value of ```$array``` may be accessed with\n```$array[array_key_first($array)];\n```\nYou still had better check that the array is not empty though, or you will get an error:\n```$firstKey = array_key_first($array);\nif (null === $firstKey) {\n    $value = &quot;Array is empty&quot;; // An error should be handled here\n} else {\n    $value = $array[$firstKey];\n}\n```"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A developer or programmer with a focus on PHP and web development.

{"conversations": ["How to polish silver rings?", "Silver tarnishes as it\u2019s exposed to air and light. Fortunately, restoring your silver to its original gleam can be done fairly easily. Whether you use a combination of baking soda and vinegar, salt and lemon juice, beer, aluminum foil and baking soda, silver polish, or toothpaste to get the job done, you\u2019ll have your silver looking brand new in no time! Plus, each method is effective for rings with diamonds, gems, or other precious stones in them.\n\n## Cleaning rings with baking soda and vinegar\n\n1. Mix \u20442 cup (120 mL) of vinegar and 2 tbsp (28.3 g) of baking soda. Pour the 2 ingredients in a small plastic container. Then, stir the mixture 4-5 times with a spoon. You will start to see a bubbling reaction. You can use a metal or glass container if you\u2019d like.\n2. Submerge your rings in the solution for 2-3 hours. Ensure the rings are completely submerged the entire time. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have an uneven clean. Check the rings every 30 minutes to see that they\u2019re completely soaked in the solution. Take them out of the mixture after 2 hours to keep tabs on their progress. If the rings don\u2019t look clean after 2 hours, stick them back in the solution and wait 1 more hour.\n3. Scrub the rings with a toothbrush. Remove the rings from the baking soda and vinegar solution after a few hours. Use a toothbrush to scrub and polish the rings, paying special attention to particularly tarnished areas.Tip: Dedicate a new, soft-bristled toothbrush to cleaning your rings and be sure to rinse it thoroughly once you're done.\n4. Rinse the rings under cold water to remove residue. Turn on your faucet and let the water get cold. Then, place the ring under the water stream and rinse it for 15-20 seconds to remove the vinegar and baking soda residue.\n5. Dry the rings with a soft, clean cloth. Use a new, lint-free piece of cloth to remove any remaining residue and buff the rings. Make sure to flip the cloth over and use both sides to clean the rings. Otherwise, some of the residue could rub back onto the rings and you\u2019ll have to start over. Do not use a paper towel to clean the rings, as this could scratch the silver.Did you know? The baking soda and vinegar create a chemical reaction which sucks up the tarnish and removes it from the rings.\n\n\n## Soaking your rings in beer\n\n1. Pour a fresh beer into a glass or bowl. Use a regular, unopened beer to clean light tarnish off of your rings. Open the beer and transfer it into a glass or bowl.You only need enough beer to cover your rings, so you may not need to use the entire can or bottle.\n2. Soak your rings for 10-15 minutes. Place your rings into the glass or bowl, then set a timer for 10-15 minutes. Allow your rings to soak so that the beer has time to remove the tarnish.Leaving your rings in the beer for longer than 15 minutes won't harm them, but it's not necessary.\n3. Rinse your rings with warm water. Hold the rings under a stream of running water to rinse off the beer. Make sure you rinse the rings thoroughly to remove all of the beer.Be careful not to drop the rings. It may be a good idea to close the drain in the sink just in case.\n4. Dry your rings using a soft cloth. First, soak up any excess water. Then, use the cloth to lightly buff the rings to remove any remaining tarnish. Your rings should look shiny and clean!\n\n\n## Using lemon juice and salt\n\n1. Add 1.5 cups (350 mL) of warm water to a bowl. Use a measuring cup to pour the correct amount of water into a bowl. Use warm water so that the salt will more easily dissolve.Don't use hot water because you don't want to accidentally burn yourself.\n2. Stir 1 tbsp (17 g) of salt and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of lemon juice into the water. Measure out the correct amount of salt and lemon juice. Add them to your warm water, then stir the ingredients together with a spoon until the salt dissolves.It should only take a couple of minutes to mix the ingredients.\n3. Add .5 cups (34 grams) of dry milk to the mixture. Measure out the dry milk, then slowly pour it into the bowl. Stir the mixture with a spoon until the dry milk completely dissolves in the water. Once the water is an opaque, milky white, your solution is ready to use.You can try doing this method without the milk. If you don't want to use dry milk, triple the amount of salt and lemon juice you use. Add 3 tbsp (51 g) of salt and 3 US tbsp (44 mL) of lemon juice.\n4. Place your rings in the solution and soak for 6-8 hours. Slowly drop your rings into your homemade cleaning solution. Then, leave them to sit for at least 6-8 hours. This gives the solution time to work.You can leave them to soak overnight for an easy option. Otherwise, set a timer so you can check on them in 6-8 hours.\n5. Remove your rings and rinse them in warm water. Use a fork or slotted spoon to retrieve your rings from the cleaning solution. Then, hold your rings under warm running water. Rinse your rings until all of the cleaning solution is removed.Be careful that you don't accidentally drop your rings in the sink. It's best to close the drain just in case.\n6. Dry your rings with a soft cloth. Pat your rings dry to remove any excess moisture. Then, use your cloth to buff the rings, which should remove any remaining tarnish. Your rings should look shiny and tarnish-free!\n\n\n## Polishing rings with aluminum foil\n\n1. Place aluminum foil along the bottom and sides of a bowl. You can use a plastic, glass, or metal bowl or dish for this process. Rip off a sheet of aluminum foil and use it to cover the entire inside of the bowl. To ensure the aluminum foil fits securely, wrap it around the edges of the bowl and press down firmly to lock it in place.\n2. Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil. Use enough water to fill the dish that\u2019s covered in aluminum foil. Place the pot on the stove and turn the burner to high. Keep the pot on the stove until the water comes to a roaring boil. The aluminum foil dish doesn\u2019t need to be that big to fit a couple of rings, so you won't need a lot of water. As a result, it should come to a boil within a few minutes.\n3. Add 1 tbsp (14.3 g) of baking soda per 1 cup (240 mL) of water. If you\u2019re working with an 8 oz (230 g) container, you\u2019ll only need 1 cup (240 mL) of water and therefore only 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of baking soda. Pour the baking soda into the water and stir the mixture for about 5 minutes. The solution will froth and bubble a little bit.\n4. Put the rings in the dish so that they\u2019re touching the aluminum foil. Set the rings at the bottom of the dish. Depending on how many rings you\u2019re trying to clean, some of the rings might touch up against the side of the dish. This is why it\u2019s important to have the sides of the dish covered in aluminum foil as well. Let the rings sit on top of the aluminum foil for 5 minutes. In order for the chemical reaction to occur, the rings need to be touching the aluminum foil at all times.\n5. Pour the solution into the dish to soak the rings. Remove the mixture from the stove and slowly pour it into the dish. Wear oven mitts and pour carefully. Let the rings sit in the solution for 10 minutes. Depending on the level of tarnish, the job might be done in 2 minutes. Check your rings every few minutes to see how much of the tarnish has worn off. Once the rings look shiny and polished, you can remove them from the solution with tongs.\n6. Allow the rings to dry on a towel for 15 minutes. Take the rings out of the solution and put them on a kitchen towel. You can finish drying the rings off by wiping them with a clean, white cloth. This process works for anything that\u2019s made of silver.Did you know? The aluminum foil works with the solution of water and baking soda to reverse the chemical reaction that made the silver tarnish in the first place.\n\n\n## Using silver polish to clean your rings\n\n1. Put a small amount of polish on a clean cloth. You get can silver polish at your local hardware store or buy a bottle online. Squeeze out a dab of polish and rub it into the cloth. You can dampen the cloth if you\u2019d like. You can get a bottle of silver polish for under $10.\n2. Rub the polish in an up-and-down motion. Don\u2019t rub the polish in a circular motion. If you do this, you\u2019ll highlight the scratches in the rings. Place your fingers in the cloth and gently rub the polish over each part of your rings. The polish will eliminate the tarnish and make your silver rings shine.Tip: Use a clean cloth for each ring and flip the cloth over when you see tarnish on the fabric to avoid transferring it back to the silver.\n3. Rinse the rings and dry them with a cloth. Run the faucet for 2 minutes so that the water becomes warm. Once the water heats up, place the rings underneath the faucet to remove any excess polish. Then, buff the rings with a new, dry cloth to get the shine you\u2019re looking for. Clean the rings with an unused cloth to avoid putting the tarnish or polish back on the rings.\n\n\n## Utilizing non-gel toothpaste to clean your rings\n\n1. Apply toothpaste to your silver rings. Put a dollop of toothpaste directly on the silver. Apply the same amount of toothpaste you would use to brush your teeth. It doesn\u2019t matter where on the ring you put the toothpaste because you\u2019ll be spreading it evenly with your toothbrush.Warning: Do not use toothpaste with gel to clean your rings. The gel will not clean the rings effectively.\n2. Wet a toothbrush lightly and brush the rings, then wipe off the toothpaste. Add a few drops of water to your toothbrush and vigorously scrub the toothpaste into the rings. Get in all the tough to reach spots, such as any engravings. The toothpaste will eliminate the tarnish and make your silver look good as new. Use a new, clean, soft-bristled toothbrush for this job. Wipe off any excess toothpaste with a dry cloth.Tip: If your rings have a ton of tarnish on them, let them sit for about 1-2 minutes before finishing the job.\n3. Rinse the remaining toothpaste off with cold water and dry your rings. Turn on your faucet and place each ring under the running water for about 30 seconds. Be sure to remove all the toothpaste and tarnish residue\n\t* Pat the rings dry with a cloth when you\u2019re done.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A jewelry enthusiast or a silversmith who is interested in maintaining and enhancing the beauty of their silver rings.

{"conversations": ["How to make a cat tree?", "Cats are natural climbers, and will happily crawl all over tall structures. A homemade cat tree will provide your kitty with hours of entertainment, and can be built at a fraction of the cost of cat trees available at a pet store. With some tools and dedication, you can make a customized cat tree based on your cat's personality!\n\n## Build a cat tree from wood and carpet\n\n1. Design your cat tree. Before purchasing materials or starting to build, you need a design plan, which you can sketch out on a piece of paper to determine your materials shopping list. There are several things to consider when designing your cat tree. First, consider your space limitations. Determine where your cat tree will be placed, and what size will fit well into that space. It's a good idea to take measurements to ensure your finished product will fit the space. You should also consider your cat's personality. If your cat likes to climb, consider building a tall cat tree with several perches. If your cat would like a private place to hide or sleep, consider building in a covered sleeping nook. Finally, you should keep your carpentry skills in mind. If you are relatively inexperienced with building things and using tools, keep your design simple so that you aren't overwhelmed. If you're at a loss for where to begin, there are several websites that have pictures of do-it-yourself cat trees you can use for inspiration, or even patterns for cat trees other people have made.\n2. Buy your materials. Use your design plan to determine which materials you will need. Plywood works well for horizontal platforms; dimensional lumber and cardboard or PVC pipe work well for vertical supports, and carpet is ideal for covering the wood. You may also need the following tools to assemble your tree:\n\t* A drill and some wood screws\n\t* An electric stapler\n\t* A table saw and a handsaw\n\t* A Hammer and nails\n\t* A carpet or utility knife\n\t* Wood glue or another powerful adhesive\n\t* If you want to create covered areas for your cat to perch, you may also want to pick up a concrete form tube. These heavy-duty cardboard tubes make great perches and tunnels for cats. These can also be cut lengthwise using a utility knife to create concave platforms or open-topped beds for your cat.\n3. Cut all materials to size. Using your plan as a guide, cut all the plywood and lumber sections to size. A simple hand saw works well for cutting dimensional lumber, while a handheld circular saw or table saw is better for cutting sheets of plywood. Sand rough edges if desired.\n4. Build the base of your cat tree. The tree needs a sturdy base, which should extend farther out from the center than any other platform or component of the tree in order to prevent tipping. To make the base, a good option is to cut 2 squares of plywood to size and glue them together for extra thickness. A 24\" (60 cm) square works well for a basic cat tree, but the taller your tree, the larger you'll want to make the base, to ensure it is sturdy.\n5. Cover the base in carpet. Before attaching any vertical supports, it's best to cover the base with carpet or a thick upholstery fabric. Cut the carpet to size, making it a few inches larger than the base on all sides. Then, wrap its edges over the edges of the plywood base, and staple it in place on the underside of the base with a staple gun. You may need to cut small notches in the carpet at the corners to make it fold neatly beneath the base.\n6. Attach the vertical supports to the base. The vertical supports that will hold up your platforms can be attached to the base with screws, nails, bolts or wood glue. Flip the base over so the carpeted side is face down. Then, drill holes through the underside of the base in the spots where you want the supports to be. Attach the supports by inserting screws or nails through the holes and driving them into the supports. You may want to cover the supports with carpet before attaching them, as this will be easier than doing it after they are already secured in place. To make your cat tree double as a scratching post, wrap one or more of the supports in sisal rope, securing each end with wire brads or staples, placed where they will be out view and won't be scratched by the cat. If you use staples, you may need to tap them down with a hammer to make sure they don't stick out too much.\n7. Attach the horizontal perches to the supports. The plywood perches can be attached using wood screws and/or gluing them to the tops of the vertical members. Wrap them in carpet or fabric after affixing them, so that the screws aren't visible through the carpet, and staple the carpet in place on the underside as you did with the base.\n8. Continue building according to your design. Continue to affix each component, referring back to your plan for measurements and placement. Adjustments to your design can be made as you go to account for stability issues, new ideas, or incorrect measurements.\n\n\n## Build a cat tree from a ladder\n\n1. Obtain a ladder. For this simple, unique cat tree, you'll need an old wooden ladder. Look around at garage sales, thrift furniture stores, and antique stores for one 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2 m) high. Choose an old-fashioned ladder that looks like an upside-down \"v\" with several steps on either side that are at matching levels. It's fine if the wood looks old, but make sure the foundation of the ladder isn't too rickety. You want to be certain your cat tree won't tip over and hurt your cat. Try to find a ladder that's around four feet tall. A very tall ladder my be less stable or too tall for your cat.\n2. Gather your supplies. The ladder is going to be the base of the tree, but you'll need to alter it a bit to make it more cat friendly. Gather these supplies:\n\t* A piece of plywood long and wide enough to rest on two rungs of the ladder at the same level. This will provide a platform for your cat. If you want more than one platform, you'll need more than one piece of plywood. A hammer and 2\" nails\n\t* Carpet\n\t* An electric staple gun\n\t* A piece of canvas, denim, or other sturdy fabric you can use to create a hammock between the two bottom rungs\n\t* A can of paint (optional)\n\t* A toy that hangs from a piece of rope or string\n\t* Sisal rope to wrap around the legs of the ladder\n3. Sand and paint your ladder and wood pieces. Use fine-grain sandpaper to sand down the ladder and remove any jagged edges or splinters. Do the same to the pieces of plywood you bought. Paint the ladder and plywood pieces with a coat or two of paint, if you're using it. Let the paint dry completely. Use your imagination when it comes time to paint. You could just paint the ladder to match your existing decor. But you could also paint it brown and green to make it look like a tree, or use stencils to make designs up and down the sides. Instead of painting the platforms, you can make them more comfortable for you cat by covering them in carpet, attaching it to to the platforms after nailing them into place. Use your staple gun and affix the carpet with staples in the perimeter and in the center. Make sure they don't stick up from the platform, tapping them down with a hammer if necessary.\n4. Nail the plywood platforms to the ladder. Position the first piece of plywood so that it is lined up across two ladder rungs of equal height. Use the hammer and four nails to nail the plywood into the wooden rungs, placing one nail in each corner of the plywood. Make sure the platforms are very secure when you're finished nailing them down. You may wish to use more nails, or substitute wood screws for a firmer hold. If you have a second piece of plywood to create another level, use the same procedure to nail it down.\n5. Install the hammock. Many cats enjoy sleeping in hammocks. If you'd like to add one to your cat tree, measure and cut your piece of cloth so that its four corners stretch between the four legs of the ladder. Nail or staple a corner of the fabric to the inside of each leg, making sure that the nails are all at the exact same height. Be sure the fabric you use for the hammock is thick enough to hold the weight of your cat. You can double the fabric or hem the edges before nailing it down to make it sturdier. Fabric that stretches a little is ideal for cat hammocks. Make sure nails or staples do not protrude in such a way that your cat could be scratched or cut. Tap your staples with hammer if necessary. Instead of a hammock, you can also use a carpeted concrete form tube, fastened to the ladder by attaching it to two 2X4 pieces of lumber secured to the base of the ladder with bolts, nails, or screws, between the legs. This will make your cat tree less portable, but also sturdier.\n6. Wrap the ladder legs in rope. If you want the cat tree to double as a scratching post, you can wrap the bottom of the ladder legs in strong, coarse rope. Cut the rope in four pieces. Use staples to secure the end of the first piece of rope to the inside of the base of one of the legs. Wrap the leg tightly with rope, tapping it down with a hammer if necessary. Secure the other end with a staple, making sure it is away from any areas the cat is most likely to scratch often. Repeat with the other four legs. If you want to, you can cover the legs entirely with rope, from top to bottom, using a new piece of rope between each rung of the ladder. This will allow your cat access to a scratchable surface nearly anywhere on its new cat tree.\n7. Finish up. Hang the toy you bought from the top of the ladder, somewhere the cat will be able to reach it, so as to entice your cat to come and play. Add any other finishing touches you want to make your cat tree unique and fun for your cat.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A creative and environmentally-conscious individual who enjoys crafting and upcycling household items.

{"conversations": ["How to walk a slackline?", "## The basics\n\n1. Start with a short slackline. The shorter the distance between the two anchor points, the more stable the slackline. As the slackline gets longer, a few things happen:\n\t* The tension in the line increases, making dismounts more dangerous due to the extra force;\n\t* The height of the line off the ground increases to allow for greater sag when weighted;\n\t* It requires more force to tighten it, which can be difficult with some tightening systems.\n2. Place one foot lengthwise in the middle of the slackline. Starting barefoot is a good idea. Using bare feet will allow you to feel the line better and find your balance more quickly. Step on the line so that it runs from between your big toe and second toe back to the middle of the heel. As you improve, practice turning your feet and standing sideways, with your shoulders parallel to the line. Once you improve (or if the landing is not safe for bare feet), you may want to switch to shoes since they provide greater protection when attempting tricks and landing.\n3. You can mount the slackline at any point, but starting in the middle is generally safer, since it is usually away from obstacles you might hit when falling. The line is also lower to the ground in the middle once weighted, reducing the height of the falls. Practice from the same place each time since the slackline oscillates differently at different distances from the anchors. The wobbles are faster and smaller near the anchors and slower and larger near the middle. But wherever you start, it is going to wobble a lot. This is natural; everyone wobbles the first time.\n4. Take a couple deep breaths and settle yourself. If you are relaxed, your foot will be less shaky on the line.\n5. Focus intently on a single point, such as the anchor. This will help you find and keep your balance. Resist the temptation to look straight down at your feet on the line. Looking down at the wobbling line will simply make you wobble as well. Look ahead instead of down at the line.\n6. Put your arms out wide, slightly bent and keep an upright posture.\n7. Center your weight directly over the foot on the line. With one smooth, balanced motion stand up on that leg.\n8. Balance on one foot, while using your arms and other leg to help maintain your balance.\n9. Bend the leg that is on the slackline. Bending your leg lowers your center of gravity slightly, and allows you to more easily find your balance and absorb the movements of the line.\n10. Continue to wave your free arms and legs around to help you balance. Sometimes you will twist and turn your body into all sorts of positions to keep your balance. Once you have caught your balance slowly move your body back to center with your arms up and out, knee(s) bent, head up, and eyes focused on a single point.\n11. Repeat these steps until you can balance for at least 15 seconds.\n12. Practice with the other foot. Once you can keep your balance, attempt taking a step.\n13. Once you've successfully taken your first step, keep practicing!\n\n\n## Sample skill progression for beginners\n\n1. These are small steps you can take to improve your slack lining effectively, by slowly taking on harder and harder tasks. Mount the line on one foot with a friend sitting on the line. Increase the distance between you and the person sitting on the line. Balance on one foot by yourself. Balance on the other foot. Balance with both feet, one behind the other, on the line. Take small steps forward. Take small steps backwards. Mount the line sideways (shoulders parallel to the line) with both feet, one at a time. Turn on the line.\n2. Additionally, learn how to fall safely. As a beginner you will likely be on a short, low-to-the-ground slackline. Most of the time you can land on your feet. As you try new tricks, the slackline can \"throw\" you as you lose your balance. The best solution is to use the \"throw\" of the slackline to help you get away from the line and land on your feet. If you are thrown off-balance from the line consider rolling through the fall to limit the impact.\n3. You can also try starting with \"training wheels.\" One way to do so is to have a friend sit on the line a few feet away from you. This takes much of the sway and bounce out of the line. As you get better, have your friend move further away on the line to allow for more wobble. When starting out, you can aid each other while learning to balance--have a spotter stand/walk next to the line. If you practice walking back and forth with a shoulder to lean on, you\u2019ll soon find that you don\u2019t need training wheels any more!\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an enthusiastic DIYer or hobbyist with an interest in birdwatching and wildlife conservation.

{"conversations": ["How to be a domestic goddess?", "Being a domestic goddess has distinct advantages, regardless of whether you live alone or serve as the matron of a big family. If you lack cleaning, cooking, and sewing skills, learning to master these tasks may seem intimidating. The key is to start small and avoid overwhelming yourself. With time and patience, you can polish your skills to goddess level.\n\n## Part one: chores and home maintenance\n\n1. Set a daily routine. There are a handful of chores you should do each day if you want to maintain a clean and clutter-free domestic heaven. Thankfully, these chores are quick enough to squeeze in even if you work a job outside of the home or have a houseful of kids to attend to. To reduce your stress as much as possible, plan on accomplishing each of these daily chores during a certain time of the day. Organizing your time may help you relieve some of the anxiety you feel about getting everything done. Daily tasks you'll need to make time for include making the bed, sorting the mail, and sweeping or vacuuming the floor. Other daily tasks should be performed as you go along. These include putting things away (to prevent clutter from developing), cleaning up as you cook, and wiping up fresh spills.\n2. Make a weekly schedule. Some chores only need to be done once or twice a week. Instead of rushing around to get these chores done all at once, plan on doing a little each day and set aside certain days for certain tasks. You'll likely feel more relaxed about getting things done, which means you'll do a better, more thorough job. Clean the bathrooms once a week. Make sure that you wash all bath linens and scrub all toilets, tubs, and sinks. Empty the trash, clean the mirrors, dust the lights, and wipe up the floor. The bedrooms in your home also need a thorough weekly cleaning. Put away anything that has been sitting out on a desk or side table. Clean all sheets, pillowcases, and blankets. Empty the trash, dust all the surfaces, and vacuum the floor. You may need to vacuum your living room, kitchen, and dining room every day or two, but other chores, like dusting, washing rugs/mats, and wiping mirrors, can be done once a week.\n3. Experiment with different cleaning products. Not every household cleaner is just as good as every other. Moreover, different types of cleaners may work better on different areas of your home. If there is some part of your usual cleaning routine that leaves a lot to be desired, figure out why your current cleaner is not doing the job right and research which options might be better. Compare chemical and organic products. Nowadays, many people prefer cleaning products made from natural ingredients instead of chemical cleaners. Natural cleaners have their own pros and cons, just as chemical cleaners have, but it doesn't hurt to include a few organic products among those you plan on testing out. Ask your friends for suggestions or do some research online about your different options. Test a few different products out on a trial basis. Pay close attention to which products work best with different materials\u2014wood, glass, ceramic, plastic, and so on.\n4. Be handy. The modern domestic goddess needs to know a bit more about the handy side of home care than earlier counterparts did. You don't need to know how to maintain all the systems and utilities in your home, but learning how to take care of a few basic projects is a wise move. At minimum, your home tool kit should contain a hammer and a few different screwdrivers. These tools will allow you to do simple tasks like hanging pictures and making small repairs to things like toys, cabinets, and drawers.\n5. Organize your realm. Clutter is the natural enemy of any domestic goddess. If you want to maintain a living space that any mortal would be envious of, you need to keep things orderly and in their place. Brush up on space-saving techniques and similar skills to keep your belongings in check. This is especially important if you're dealing with limited space. Get rid of any unnecessary junk first, then organize everything that has a purpose in a way that makes sense based on your needs.\n6. Master the laundry. Laundry is one chore that you will never be able to avoid if you want to be a domestic goddess. Your current laundry skills might be adequate, but you should still continue to watch out for aspects of your laundry routine that could stand to use improvement. Consider assigning different laundry tasks to different days, as well. For instance, you can clean bathroom towels on Tuesday, bed sheets and pillowcases on Wednesday, and any other miscellaneous towels or blankets on Thursday. Clothing will need to be cleaned throughout the week, though. Read the labels before you wash something and follow the laundering instructions provided. If you aren't sure whether or not an item will bleed color in the washing machine, test it by soaking a small spot and blotting that spot with a white cloth. Wash colors and whites separately. Also separate heavily soiled items and wash those on their own. Pretreat stains and presoak heavily soiled garments in a sink or bucket of water for 30 minutes before washing them. Use the recommended amount of detergent and select the best washer cycle for each individual load. Base water temperature and dryer settings on color and fabric type. Materials that can shrink should be washed in warm or cold water and air dried, for instance. Cold water is best for bright colors, while hot water works well for whites.\n7. Learn a few tricks. Once you've mastered the basics, keep an eye out for various tips and tricks that can take your home skills from \u201cgreat\u201d to \u201camazing.\u201d Some tricks work better than others, though, so you should test them out before bragging to your friends about your newfound knowledge. For instance, cover dirty stroller wheels and wagon wheels with plastic shower caps before bringing the item inside. Wrap pipe cleaners around the neck of condiment bottles to catch drips and prevent crusty build-up. Stuff holes in the wall and cabinets with steel wool to keep mice and other pests out.\n\n\n## Part two: in the kitchen\n\n1. Get off to an easy start. If you currently have some cooking and baking knowledge, then you're off to a good start already. If not, start small by making simple meals and following easy recipes. You can gradually build up your kitchen skills as you get more comfortable, but trying too much all at once is a good way to fail and get discouraged. Look for books specifically aimed at beginners or search for easy recipes online. Instructions that provide step-by-step pictures are often the easiest to follow along.\n2. Take a class. Look for free and cheap cooking classes in your area. Focus on developing skills that you're specifically interested in developing, and skip any class that will teach you something you already know or will teach you something you have no desire to learn. Local craft stores often offer classes on baking and food decorating. Small markets may have classes on cooking essentials. Check out cooking schools in your area. Even if you don't want to spend time and money on a cooking program, some of these schools offer one-time cooking courses at a discounted price.\n3. Find your niche. Not every domestic goddess needs to love cooking, but learning to enjoy it can motivate you into improving your skills. Try to find something about cooking or baking that you can feel passionate\u2014or at least interested\u2014about. Build up your cooking skills in general, but involve your point of interest as much as possible while doing so. Your passion might be something simple, like baking cookies or mastering stovetop cooking. On the other hand, you might find your attention grabbed by something a little more unique, like gluten-free baking or canning.\n4. Make any necessary adjustments. You might have a full set of cooking and baking skills when all is said and done, but that doesn't mean you will be able to show them all off each and every day. Know when to make a simple meal and when to whip up something more impressive. Learning how to use your cooking to improve and please those you're cooking for is another skill you will need to master. For example, if you're cooking for picky kids, focus on choosing kid-friendly meals instead of trying to impress them with an elaborate meal they won't even eat. When you're cooking for guests, find out about any food allergies or special diets ahead of time and plan your menu accordingly.\n5. Experiment. Once you feel comfortable enough in the kitchen, start using the skills and knowledge you have gained to experiment with your own recipes and tasty creations. Some experiments might be a success while others will likely be a failure. The important thing is simply to keep working at it until your successes vastly outnumber your failures.\n\n\n## Part three: sew and other \"lost\" skills\n\n1. Master the basics of sewing. Sewing is the queen of lost skills, so if you don't know even the most basic stitches, you really aren't alone. At minimum, though, you should know how to sew hems, repair small rips and tears, and attach buttons. Learn a variety of basic stitches, including the straight stitch, the back stitch, the zigzag stitch, and the basting stitch. Invest in a sewing machine. As your sewing skills improve, consider buying a sewing machine of your own. You will probably be glad that you did. Fixing garments and creating projects from scratch will both be much easier if you learn to machine sew as well as hand sew.\n2. Get crafty. Sewing is not the only lost skill worth learning, of course. There is a wide range of other crafts and domestic abilities you can explore. You do not need to master all of them, but picking one or two you'd like to become great at can improve your standing as a domestic goddess. Potential areas of interest could include gardening, crocheting, or knitting. You could also check out community craft websites, like Pinterest, to get more ideas.\n3. Take classes. You can learn a lot by teaching yourself, but sometimes, the best way to learn a new skill or to advance an old one is to take an actual class on it. Look for cheap classes in your area or sign up for a class online.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally conscious individual who is passionate about sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint.

{"conversations": ["How to save gift wrapping paper?", "We've all seen promotional material for having \"green\" (environmentally sound) events, conserving paper, and saving trees.  In this article we'll see several alternatives to one time usage of rolls of wrapping paper for gifts.\n\n## Reuse wrap paper\n\n1. Wrap the gift in such a way as to promote reuse: When selecting wrapping paper, select paper which is durable. When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.\n2. Unwrap the gift for reuse, too. When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper. Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.\n3. Share the paper with several guests. If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.\n\n\n## Use gift bag with a gift tag\n\n1. Purchase a nice gift bag (or reusable bag), rather than wrapping paper for each gift.\n2. Make and attach a large gift tag to the bottom of the bag covering the manufacturers name, etc. Include at least 12 rows on the tag. Write your name, email, occasion and date on the first row of the tag.\n3. Place gift item in bag and present to honoree as usual. After honoree removes the gift from the bag, they save the bag for the next occasion.\n4. When the honoree has an occasion to give a gift, they write their name, occasion and date on the first blank line on the tag.\n5. Repeat the re-use and gifting process 12 times.\n6. Have the twelfth person to receive the gift bag send an email to everyone listed on the tag with the bag's history. Assuming the bag remains in usable condition, they can then attach a new tag on top of the original tag and repeat the process.\n7. Keep the reuse and gifting chain going until the back is too worn to continue. Ultimately, recycle the bag.\n\n\n## Make a gift display rather than gift wrap\n\n1. Bring unwrapped gifts to the celebration.\n2. Place the gifts on a display table. Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.\n3. Prepare a one page log for the honoree. It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift. The honoree can then use this log to send Thank You notes. Only one sheet of paper is consumed for the entire event!\n4. When it is time to present the gifts, position the honoree behind the table along with the guests. Take photos of the covered table, uncover the table and photograph the table displaying the gifts. (Optionally, make a video of the table being uncovered.)\n\n\n## Gift wrap (blindfold) the honoree instead of the gift\n\n1. If your honoree is adventuresome, blindfold them with an attractive looking bandana or blindfold prior to displaying or presenting any gifts.\n2. Present each gift to the blindfolded honoree while the people giving the gift stand behind them.\n3. Have the honoree identify the gift by feeling of it. If you want to make the task more challenging have the honoree wear attractive looking gloves or mittens while doing this. Optionally, have the honoree guess who gave them the gift.\n4. Of course, take numerous photos (and possibly video) of the gift giving process.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A budget-conscious individual who enjoys gift-giving and is looking for ways to reduce waste and save money.

{"conversations": ["How do I initialize a TypeScript Object with a JSON-Object?", "This question is quite broad, here are two solutions.\n\n### Solution 1: Helper Method\nHere's an example of using a Helper Method that you could change to fit your needs:\n```class SerializationHelper {\n    static toInstance(obj: T, json: string) : T {\n        var jsonObj = JSON.parse(json);\n        if (typeof obj[\"fromJSON\"] === \"function\") {\n            obj[\"fromJSON\"](jsonObj);\n        }\n        else {\n            for (var propName in jsonObj) {\n                obj[propName] = jsonObj[propName]\n            }\n        }\n        return obj;\n    }\n}\n```\nThen use it:\n```var json = '{\"name\": \"John Doe\"}',\n    foo = SerializationHelper.toInstance(new Foo(), json);\nfoo.GetName() === \"John Doe\";\n```\n\n* Advanced Deserialization\nThis could also allow for some custom deserialization by adding your own ```fromJSON``` method to the class (this works well with how ```JSON.stringify``` already uses the ```toJSON``` method, as shown below):\n```interface IFooSerialized {\n    nameSomethingElse: string;\n}\nclass Foo {\n  name: string;\n  GetName(): string { return this.name }\n  toJSON(): IFooSerialized {\n      return {\n          nameSomethingElse: this.name\n      };\n  }\n  fromJSON(obj: IFooSerialized) {\n        this.name = obj.nameSomethingElse;\n  }\n}\n```\nThen use it:\n```var foo1 = new Foo();\nfoo1.name = \"John Doe\";\nvar json = JSON.stringify(foo1);\njson === '{\"nameSomethingElse\":\"John Doe\"}';\nvar foo2 = SerializationHelper.toInstance(new Foo(), json);\nfoo2.GetName() === \"John Doe\";\n```\n\n### Solution 2: Base Class\nAnother way you could do this is by creating your own base class:\n```class Serializable {\n    fillFromJSON(json: string) {\n        var jsonObj = JSON.parse(json);\n        for (var propName in jsonObj) {\n            this[propName] = jsonObj[propName]\n        }\n    }\n}\nclass Foo extends Serializable {\n    name: string;\n    GetName(): string { return this.name }\n}\n```\nThen use it:\n```var foo = new Foo();\nfoo.fillFromJSON(json);\n```\n\nThere are too many different ways to implement a custom deserialization using a base class, and ultimately it depends on how your own choice."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A developer or programmer with a background in JavaScript and an interest in TypeScript.

So, the difference between `stop` and `start` is the number of elements selected (if `step` is 1, the default).\n\nThe other feature is that `start` or `stop` may be a negative number, which means it counts from the end of the array instead of the beginning. So:\n```\na[-1]    # last item in the array\na[-2:]   # last two items in the array\na[:-2]   # everything except the last two items\n```\nSimilarly, `step` may be a negative number:\n```\na[::-1]    # all items in the array, reversed\na[1::-1]   # the first two items, reversed\na[:-3:-1]  # the last two items, reversed\na[-3::-1]  # everything except the last two items, reversed\n```\n\nPython is kind to the programmer if there are fewer items than you ask for. For example, if you ask for ```a[:-2]``` and ```a``` only contains one element, you get an empty list instead of an error. Sometimes you would prefer the error, so you have to be aware that this may happen.\n\n## Relationship with the ```slice``` object\n\nA slice object can represent a slicing operation, i.e.:\n```\na[start:stop:step]\n```\nis equivalent to:\n```\na[slice(start, stop, step)]\n```\n\nSlice objects also behave slightly differently depending on the number of arguments, similarly to ```range()```, i.e. both ```slice(stop)``` and ```slice(start, stop[, step])``` are supported. To skip specifying a given argument, one might use ```None```, so that e.g. ```a[start:]``` is equivalent to ```a[slice(start, None)]``` or ```a[::-1]``` is equivalent to ```a[slice(None, None, -1)]```.\n\nWhile the ```:```-based notation is very helpful for simple slicing, the explicit use of ```slice()``` objects simplifies the programmatic generation of slicing."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A software developer or data analyst with a strong background in Python programming.

{"conversations": ["How to lessen the pressure of life?", "## Reduce the pressure of life\n\n1. Start a stress journal to identify and reflect on the sources of pressure in your life. Are you experiencing financial pressure? Are you experiencing stresses at a new job or as a result of a job loss? A stress journal can help you identify the most significant sources of stress in your life and how you cope with them. This self knowledge will help you tackle the biggest stressors in your life. You can also reflect on the specific situations within which you experience higher stress levels. Do you experience more stress at particular times of the week or in particular spaces (e.g., a conference room) at work? Are there ways of avoiding such situations entirely, or responding more effectively to them? Reflect on these kinds of questions and work towards insights on how to manage stress through journaling. Create a list of everything you are grateful for in your life. Recognizing the good things in your life can help reduce stress and anxiety.\n2. Take a stress assessment test. There may be stressors that are so normal in your life that you don't even realize they're stressing you out. A stress assessment test can help you identify these hidden stressors. There are many online tests that you can do. You can take a free stress assessment test online at https://www.stress.org/self-assessment/.\n3. Make a plan to tackle the sources of pressure in your life. Utilizing the information from your stress journal, you may decide that you need a revised financial plan, a personal health plan or a work plan. The most important thing is to tackle the sources of pressure through a purposeful and detailed plan of action. Talk to your supervisor to create a plan of action to reduce the stressors you experience at work. Make a financial plan with specific targets, including not only long term savings or retirement goals but also near term goals that are concrete and achievable. Build up your emergency or rainy day fund. Make a fitness plan to improve your health.\n4. Overcome perfectionism. A huge source of pressure in life can be the desire to be perfect at everything. Have you ever been told that you have unrealistic standards at work? Do you ever feel you will never be able to live up to your own standards? If you answered yes to these questions, you may have difficulty with perfectionism. If so, try to loosen up your standards of achievement a little bit. This should help reduce your anxiety levels. If you feel disappointed with yourself, try repeating statements like \"nobody is perfect\" or \"I did my best\"\n\t* Try to think about your situation from a different angle. Ask yourself, will this situation still matter next month? If I told my brother or friend about this situation, would they think it matters as much as I do? Gain some perspective on your situation and maybe it won't seem quite as dire as it does right now.\n5. Create work-life boundaries so that you have time for yourself. Living in a digital age with constant access to screens - computers, tablets, smart phones - can make it difficult to escape the pressures of work. The pressure to be always online and accessible to colleagues can take a toll on work-life balance. To manage this kind of stress, it is helpful to create boundaries for yourself such as telling your colleagues you will be away from the phone or the computer at certain times of the day or on the weekend. Tell your colleagues you will be away from email and phone connectivity during dinner hours.\n6. Avoid comparing yourself to other people. If you're constantly trying to be someone you're not, you will feel stressed or burdened. Don't judge yourself based on how you think other people are living their life.Remind yourself that you have talents, skills, qualities, and good characteristics that are unique to you. Evaluate your goals and successes based on you want out of life, not what others want for you. Try to reduce how much time you spend on social media. People often post the best parts of their life on social media, so it may seem as though their lives are more perfect than they actually are.\n7. Give yourself some time away from work. If you are feeling burned out, it might be time for a personal day or even a vacation. Taking a vacation can actually help your productivity, and has obvious health benefits. If you don't have time for a vacation at the moment, try to at least take the weekend off to catch up on sleep. If you have vacation time or time off from work, take advantage of it. Those days are there for you to use them. A vacation might make you more productive.\n8. Set up an automatic 'out of office' reply on your email account. By setting up an automatic reply on weekends or when you are on vacation, you will not feel guilty for ignoring work emails. Also, your colleagues will be more likely to respect your away time. Include details on the days and times you are away in your 'out of office' automatic email reply. Include a fun or wise quote in your automatic reply so that colleagues will be reminded of your personality or sense of humour. This may reduce the annoyance of getting an automatic reply.\n\n\n## Take care of yourself\n\n1. Start a regular exercise routine. Exercise has been shown to reduce stress, improve feelings of well being and self esteem. Engaging in physical exercise leads to the production of the neurotransmitter endorphin, which is associated with improved sense of well being or what some people call runner's high. You don't need to be an athlete to experience this improved mood, and just 15 minutes a day can make a big difference..\n\t* After your exercise routine, try using a heat wrap around your neck and shoulders for 10 minutes to reduce tension in your upper body.\n2. Practice meditation. Find a comfortable place to sit in a quiet room or in a park. Observe the movement of your breath as it comes into your body and then flows out. Let go of passing thoughts. You can also do a walking meditation by walking slowly, preferably in a natural area, while watching your breath. Meditating for a few minutes a day can help reduce stress and anxiety. Deep, diaphragmatic breathing can reduce the heart rate and lower anxiety. [Image:Lessen the Pressure of Life Step 8.jpg|center]]\n\t* Meditate alongside your yoga practice and in your everyday life. Mindfulness-based stress reduction such as meditation and yoga are helpful in reducing stress and anxiety, including amongst college students.\n3. Eat whole plant foods as part of a healthy diet. Whole plant foods such as whole grains (e.g., brown rice), vegetables, and fruits are negatively associated with depression and anxiety. On the other hand, processed food (e.g., canned food) has been positively associated with stress and anxiety. Drink a cup of herbal tea.\n4. Ditch your second cup of coffee. Caffeine can exacerbate stress levels, so it is good to lower your caffeine intake as part of an overall stress reduction plan. Keep in mind that you may experience withdrawal symptoms, especially if you are a heavy coffee drinker.\n5. Cut down on sugar. Stress can make you crave sugary foods, but try to resist temptation. Giving in to these urges will not actually make you feel any better. Too much sugar can cause your blood sugar to crash, which can cause more stress and cravings.Sugary foods include most desserts, baked goods, soft drinks, juices, and candy.\n6. Reduce your consumption of alcohol. Although many turn to alcohol to deal with the everyday pressures of life, alcohol consumption can actually compound the impact of stress on the body and mind. Alcohol can also make your financial anxieties worse.\n\n\n## Gain perspective on life\n\n1. Talk to your friends and family about the sources of stress in your life and about everything you are grateful for. Face to face conversations with friends and family are especially important in helping reduce the pressures of life. Plan a movie night with close friends and pick a comedy! Laughing lowers cortisol which is the body's stress hormone. Go to a concert with friends. Listening to music can help reduce stress. So why not make a night of it and decompress with friends and music you love.\n2. Use positive thinking and self-talk to ward off stress. For instance, if you are experiencing a lot of stress at work due to an impending deadline, remember to tell yourself, \u201cI can overcome this hurdle\u201d\n3. Avoid trying to control everything in your life. Sometimes, there are surprises in life. You can't always predict or control what will happen. Letting go of the need to control everything can help you become happier and more at peace with the world.\n4. Express yourself through art therapy. Tapping into your creative side can help you work through the anxiety of everyday life. Using art therapy techniques, preferably alongside an art therapist, you can use drawing, painting, or music to express your inner feelings in more nuanced ways than may be possible with words alone. You don't have to be an artist to enjoy the benefits of creative self expression, including in relation to stress reduction.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual seeking practical advice and strategies to manage stress and improve their overall well-being.

{"conversations": ["How to treat arthritis in horses?", "Arthritis is a painful joint problem that affects horses as well as humans. If your four-legged friend is suffering from the problem, supplements and medications can provide some relief from painful inflammation. Making lifestyle changes, like light exercise and farrier work, can also increase your horse\u2019s comfort and quality of life. Since arthritis is almost impossible to stop, it is important to keep in touch with a veterinarian for advice on continued treatment.\n\n## Make lifestyle change\n\n1. Consult your veterinarian. A vet will need to examine your horse and assess the factors that might be contributing to its arthritis, including age, diet, and activity level. This will help them determine the right medication and lifestyle changes to prescribe your horse. Your vet may take x-rays to assess the severity of your horse\u2019s arthritis and make further suggestions for treatment.\n2. Control the horse\u2019s weight. If your horse is overweight, this will put additional strain on its joints, worsening pain and discomfort. Help your horse lower its weight, if necessary, then feed it a nutritious but lean diet to keep its weight down. Keeping an older horse nourished can be difficult because their nutritional needs and ability to digest food may change. Always ask your vet for advice before making major changes in your horse\u2019s diet.\n3. Don\u2019t keep your horse confined to the stable. Arthritic horses will probably be reluctant or unable to move like they once did. Keeping them indoors, however, will actually make the problem worse. Provide a large pasture for them to roam and graze about to keep the joints moving and prevent the horse from getting too stiff.Regular light exercise, such as trail riding, will be good for your horse, and limit the effects of arthritis.\n4. Talk to your farrier. The condition of a horse\u2019s hooves and shoes are critical to its movement and comfort, and this is especially the case for one suffering from arthritis. Let your farrier know that the horse is having problems with arthritis, and they may make recommendations that will keep its hooves in good condition and make it more comfortable.\n\n\n## Try supplement and medications\n\n1. Give your horse feed supplements. A number of nutritional supplements are available, including glucosamine and hyaluronic acid. These can be given to your horse along with its food to help alleviate some of the symptoms of arthritis, like pain and stiffness. Look for feed supplements at a supply store, or ask your vet. Feed supplements are a simple option to try at first. However, they are not regulated, and they are not guaranteed to be effective. Ask your vet what they recommend for your horse based on the severity of your horse's issues\n2. Try injectable joint products. Some products, including polysulfated glycosaminoglycans (Adequan) and sodium hyaluronate (Legend) can be injected directly into the affected joint to give your horse some relief. A vet may also recommend injecting the joint with steroids or hyaluronic acid. These products can give immediate relief. In some cases, their benefits can last for months or years. Your vet will sterilize the area to be injected and inject the correct steroid and acid combination. Once you go down the road of injecting a joint, you will likely have to inject the same joint again in the future to keep your horse comfortable.\n3. Ask about joint projectants. Arthritis is caused by a combination of inflammation and degeneration (breaking down) at affected joints. In addition to the products that provide relief from painful inflammation, ones like glucosamine and chondroitin can help protect the joint itself from damage. Your vet can prescribe the right product for your horse.\n4. Supply pain relievers. Some products, including phenylbutazone and firocoxib, won\u2019t treat the joint itself, but will provide your horse with some general pain relief. Your vet will prescribe these for your horse if they believe the medicine will improve the horse\u2019s quality of life. Use painkillers as directed by your veterinarian. Giving pain medication more frequently than recommended or in too large a quantity can damage your horse\u2019s gastrointestinal tract and cause kidney or liver failure.\n5. Expect the issue to progress over time. Medications can definitely help a horse be more comfortable, and caring well for your horse can increase its quality of life. However, it is almost impossible to repair the damage caused by arthritis. Over time, problems caused by arthritis will increase, so it is important to stay in touch with your vet about continued treatment.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A horse owner or equine veterinarian with a keen interest in equine health and wellness.

When trees mature and are harvested for wood that's used in construction, then the captured carbon dioxide is stored for a long time (until the wood decomposes or is burned). However, if no trees are replanted after harvesting this will have had a one-time effect only. Also when wood is burned (for energy or in a wild fire), or if trees die quickly and decompose, then their captured carbon is released again. Of course all trees die eventually even when they are not harvested, this is part of the natural cycle, but a mature forest can store a lot more carbon than a young, newly-planted forest so it's important to keep a forest intact as much as possible.\n\n* The wrong type(s) of trees are planted in the wrong location.\nIn the past there were bad offsetting schemes that planted non-native trees, or planted trees in a location where they would change water flows  and thus change local ecosystems in a negative way. Some offsetting schemes planted  thousands of trees of the same species, resulting in a large monoculture. Such a monoculture hinders biodiversity, is susceptible to diseases and can even damage local communities.\nThere have also been reports that planting trees above a certain latitude can have a net warming effect by changing the albedo and trapping heat. \n\n* Buying offsets reduces the incentive for people to reduce their emissions.\nReducing emissions is much more effective than offsetting.

Apparently, there is also something called quantum gate teleportation.\nWhat is quantum gate teleportation and what is it used for?\nI am particularly interested in possible applications in simulating quantum circuits.", "Quantum gate teleportation is the act of being able to apply a quantum gate on the unknown state while it is being teleported. This is one of the ways in which measurement-based computation can be described using graph states.\n\nUsually, teleportation works by having an unknown quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ held by Alice, and two qubits in the Bell state $|\\Psi\\rangle=(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ shared between Alice and Bob. Alice performs a Bell state measurement, getting one of 4 possible answers and Bob holds on his qubit, depending on the measurement result of Alice, one of the 4 states $|\\psi\\rangle,X|\\psi\\rangle,Z|\\psi\\rangle,ZX|\\psi\\rangle.$ So, once Bob learns what result Alice got, he can compensate by applying the appropriate Paulis.\n\nLet $U$ be a 1-qubit unitary. Assume Alice and Bob share $(\\mathbb{I}\\otimes U)|\\Psi\\rangle$ instead of $|\\Psi\\rangle$. If they repeat the teleportation protocol, Bob now has one of $U|\\psi\\rangle,UX|\\psi\\rangle,UZ|\\psi\\rangle,UZX|\\psi\\rangle$, which we can rewrite as $U|\\psi\\rangle,(UXU^\\dagger)U|\\psi\\rangle,(UZU^\\dagger)U|\\psi\\rangle,(UZXU^\\dagger)U|\\psi\\rangle.$ The compensations that Bob has to make for a given measurement result are given by the bracketed terms. Often, these are no worse than the compensations you would have to make for normal teleportation (i.e. just the Pauli rotations). For example, if $U$ is the Hadamard rotation, then the corrections are just $(\\mathbb{I},Z,X,XZ)$ respectively. So, you can apply the Hadamard during teleportation just be changing the state that you teleport through (There is a strong connection here to the Choi-Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism). You can do the same for Pauli gates, and the phase gate $\\sqrt{Z}=S$. Moreover, if you repeat this protocol to build up a more complicated computation, it is often sufficient to keep a record of what these corrections are, and to apply them later.\n\nEven if you don't only need the Pauli gates (as is the case for $T=\\sqrt{S}$), the compensations may be easier than implementing the gate directly. This is the basis of the construction of the fault-tolerant T gate.\n\nIn fact, you can do something similar to apply a controlled-NOT between a pair of qubits as well. This time, the state you need is $|\\Psi\\rangle_{A_1B_1}|\\Psi\\rangle_{A_1B_1}$, and a controlled-NOT applied between $B_1$ and $B_2$.

It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries. And it creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production.\nSo in most cases, protecting the environment and promoting economic growth go hand-in-hand.

{"conversations": ["How to keep dogs safe on the fourth of july?", "## Beforehand\n\n1. Ensure that your pet\u2019s information is up to date. Many dogs escape when they are startled by fireworks. If your pet doesn\u2019t have a collar with a tag that has contact information on it, as well as a microchip with your current information, now is the time to get them. Your collar should fit securely but comfortably; it should be snug enough that it won\u2019t be easily caught on a branch or other such thing, but not so tight as to make it uncomfortable for your dog to wear it. Be certain that it doesn't restrict your dog\u2019s airflow \u2013 you should be able to fit two fingers between your dog\u2019s collar and neck. There should be a tag that ensures the dog does not have rabies and another with your name and phone number on it. A microchip is a tiny transponder that uses radiofrequency waves to transmit information on the chip about your pet when scanned. It is implemented painlessly just under the skin using a large-bore needle by veterinarians and some shelters. Once your dog has a microchip, you must register with the company the microchip is made by; now, if your dog arrives at a shelter, (s)he will be scanned and the microchip will give the shelter your phone number to contact you with. Your microchip must have recent contact information; if it does not, simply contact the microchip company to update your information.\n2. Brush up on your dog\u2019s training. Your dog should have basic obedience training, and should easily respond to you. The most vital commands to train are walking on a leash, \u201ccome,\u201d and \u201cleave it,\u201d in addition to crate training. If your puppy is young and hasn\u2019t been leash trained, and you intend to bring the dog to parades/parties/fireworks displays, now is the time to do this. For information on leash training, read this wikiHow article. Your recall command should be rock-solid. If your dog runs off in reaction to fireworks, or after an interesting smell, you must be able to recall him. A related command is \u201cstay\u201d; for information on teaching this, read this article. During parties or parades, your dog is likely to come across yummy food that\u2019s unhealthy for him to eat. To prevent him from eating anything he shouldn't, your \u201cleave it\u201d command should be very good. Another useful, related command is \u201cdrop it\u201d; for information on teaching this, read this article. A crate is a useful tool during 4th of July celebrations, serving both to safely contain the dog and often calm him/her. For information on crate training, read this article.\n3. Plan your party carefully. Choose decorations carefully \u2013 glow sticks, which are both toxic for dogs and enticingly similar to colorful chew toys, are particularly dangerous. As beer and other human food and drink are toxic for dogs, decide on a place to keep your dog(s) during the party, such as in the house if the party is in the yard. If the dog is friendly and would like to stay with the people, consider keeping him with you leashed; contained by keeping him in a room with a baby gate barring passage if the party is inside; or securely tying him to a tree, fence, or other secure object if the party is outside. Before the party, research what foods are toxic to dogs. For information on avoiding foods toxic to dogs, read this article.\n4. Contact a veterinarian. For owners of dogs that are extremely reactive to fireworks or other typical Independence Day activities, the best option may be to discuss ways to help your dog with an experienced veterinarian. Topics to discuss include reducing stress for older dogs and the option of sedating the dog using safe drugs.\n5. Consider moving your dog. If your dog is extremely stressed by Independence Day activities, the best option may be to move him to another place for the duration of the celebrations or during the most active part (such as a parade). It may be possible to locate a \u201cdoggy hotel,\u201d friend or relative in a quiet rural area willing to keep the dog; however, expect there to be at least some amount of fireworks or parties, and it can be difficult to locate a business or person willing to care for your dog during the celebrations.\n6. Investigate products that may serve to calm your dog. A commercial product of \u201canxiety wrap,\u201d has been used with great success. Created by behavioral experts, such an item can calm dogs in a manner similar to swaddling an infant. A crate can be very useful, as stated above. As wolves naturally occupied dens, a dog will find comfort in his own \u201cden,\u201d or a crate. To increase the darkness, cover the crate with a blanket, leaving part of it uncovered so the dog can see passing people and breathe fresh air. It is possible to purchase relaxing auditory CDs that have been clinically researched to calm anxious dogs; these can be helpful for calming dogs frightened by Independence Day celebrations. Ask your veterinarian for more advice.\n\n\n## Party\n\n1. Secure your dog in the pre-decided place, if applicable. If he is going into a crate, place the crate in a quiet area of the house and put a safe bone, favorite toy, or other treats inside to occupy the dog. The dog will go in for the treat; once he or she is in, drape a dark-colored blanket over the crate to create darkness. Praise him and close windows and doors; you can also play a TV, radio, iPod, etc. to cover the sound of the party, or use the soothing music. If the dog is staying in the house, choose a room where the dog will be able to see the people but which people will not enter (for example, an office or study). Leave something to keep him occupied, and consider playing music/etc.\n2. If the dog will be staying with you, keep him away from food. Avoid tables, where scraps can lay or food can sit tantalizingly close. If a guest offers your dog food, politely inform your guest that human food can be toxic for dogs and that you would prefer for your dog not to eat any. Guests, especially children, might ask you if they can walk or pet the dog; if they do, tell them that feeding the dog food is not allowed. Do not leave the dog unattended \u2013 this is particularly dangerous outside, where stray fireworks can land or the dog can bolt from if fireworks go off or there is another loud noise.\n3. Stay calm and alert. You\u2019ll want to be on the lookout for anything that could scare your dog, but keep in mind that your dog can sense your emotions and will often copy them. For example: If you\u2019re on edge and nervous, your dog will sense this and be on edge and nervous as well. Clearly, you can\u2019t control your guests\u2019 behavior, but take the following precautions:\n\t* Stay aware of the effect of the party\u2019s tone on your dog. If your dog starts to become anxious or overly active, the best option can be to put him in a separate room, crate, etc. Ask kids to play away from your dog. Children running around can be especially upsetting for a dog, and it\u2019s a good idea to ask any kids upsetting your dog to quiet down or play in a separate area.\n4. Watch out for stray fireworks. These are an unfortunate danger in places where fireworks have been set off or have been set off nearby, and it\u2019s wise to stay on guard for any, as fireworks are unpredictable and can be highly dangerous.\n\n\n## Parade\n\n1. Consider leaving your dog at home. Parades can be stressful, and often the best option is to leave him at home in a crate or room, as described in the section on parties. If you don\u2019t want to leave your dog alone, another option is to leave him with friends or family not attending. However, if you do decide to bring your dog with you, follow the steps below to keep your dog as calm and safe as possible.\n2. Purchase or gather the supplies you may need. These include:\n\t* A crate for securing your dog. A secure leash and collar. A harness or controlling item such as a head collar might be preferred, as your dog may pull. A muzzle. This is a necessary safety precaution, as the sights and sounds of a parade can distress your dog to the point of biting. A collapsible water bowl and water. Your pet must be kept hydrated, as should you.\n3. Introduce your dog to the parade gradually. Though you likely won\u2019t be able to follow through a complete desensitization due to lack of time, you can introduce your dog gradually \u2013 at first, simply allow him to adjust to the sight, smell, and noise of the crowd at a closer and closer distance, and the parade using the same rules.\n4. Keep your dog under control. You should only bring a dog to a parade if he has been obedience trained, but even if he has been, keep a closer eye on your dog than usual. Watch for signs that your dog is uneasy or upset; if the parade upsets your dog too much, you can take him away from the parade or, if possible, set up a crate in a secure location.\n5. Keep your dog as safe as possible. Keeping your dog in a car is never a safe option, as the heat can give your dog heatstroke \u2013 or even kill him \u2013 and water must be provided regularly to prevent heat stroke and keep your dog hydrated. Read this article for information on treating heat stroke.\n\n\n## Firework show\n\n1. Consider leaving your dog at home. As with parades, fireworks can be upsetting and even dangerous for dogs. Dogs who are startled by them can run off and escape, and, even if they have an up-to-date tag and microchip, are not guaranteed to be found or returned. Optionally, you can consult a veterinarian for information on drugging your dog, but in general, bringing your dog is discouraged, and should only be done if your dog:\n\t* Has heard fireworks before and did not strongly react to them;\n\t* Has an up-to-date tag and microchip;\n\t* Has basic obedience training; \u201ccome\u201d in particular must be rock-solid; and\n\t* Is calm around crowds, playing kids, other dogs, and various other features of fireworks.\n2. Gather your supplies. These are the same as in the section on parades.\n3. Train your dog. If your dog appears anxious, do not reassure him \u2013 this will reward him for bad behavior, as in essence he is receiving a yummy treat when he is afraid, telling him that he should be afraid. Instead, give him attention and a treat whenever he is calm; you are now telling him that being calm is good. Use small treats easily swallowed with a strong scent to distract the dog.\n4. Keep an eye on your dog. Signs of anxiety include the dog licking his lips, whimpering, a tense position, and showing the whites of his eyes; if these occur, quietly and calmly remove the dog from the situation. Keep your dog hydrated; bring along a collapsible water bowl and bottles of water and offer water to your dog occasionally. Keep in mind that he may be too stressed to drink \u2013 if this happens, the best option may be to remove your dog from the situation. If your dog is calm, you can distract him with treats, a Kong toy stuffed with peanut butter, a favorite toy, or any other desirable object.\n5. Be prepared to leave. If your dog is too stressed by the fireworks, the best option is to immediately leave for your home. If you\u2019re attending the fireworks with others, tell them in advance that you may have to leave if your dog becomes too anxious. At home, have a crate set up in the same manner described in the section on parties. Keep in mind that a car is not a safe option for putting your dog in, as the heat levels can kill him/her; instead, the safest option is to leave with your dog and place him in the crate. Once he\u2019s settled in, you can return to the fireworks and have fun.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned pet owner or animal lover who is seeking advice on ensuring the safety and well-being of their dog during the noisy and potentially stressful Fourth of July celebrations.

Your boat can reach 21 nautical miles per hour. \nHow do you catch the pirates?", "If we assume the ocean is flat and extends indefinitely in all directions, there is a strategy that guarantees we can catch the pirates in at most 800,000 years.\n\nPut our current location as the origin of a coordinate system. We will describe our position in polar coordinates, as a function of time: $(r(t),\\theta(t))$ (where we have arbitrarily chosen a direction to be $\\theta=0$, and $t=0$ is when we realized we had been robbed).\n\nWe begin by traveling in the $\\theta=0$ direction for 20 hours, putting our position at $(420, 0)$. We are then the same distance from the origin as the pirates. Next, we will travel in a spiral, in a manner so that $r'(t)=20$ at all times.

Because winds aloft and other factors may vary, first stage performance also varies somewhat.\nUpper stage guidance is almost always closed loop, targeting a specific position and velocity combination.

{"conversations": ["How to be a domestic goddess?", "Being a domestic goddess has distinct advantages, regardless of whether you live alone or serve as the matron of a big family. If you lack cleaning, cooking, and sewing skills, learning to master these tasks may seem intimidating. The key is to start small and avoid overwhelming yourself. With time and patience, you can polish your skills to goddess level.\n\n## Part one: chores and home maintenance\n\n1. Set a daily routine. There are a handful of chores you should do each day if you want to maintain a clean and clutter-free domestic heaven. Thankfully, these chores are quick enough to squeeze in even if you work a job outside of the home or have a houseful of kids to attend to. To reduce your stress as much as possible, plan on accomplishing each of these daily chores during a certain time of the day. Organizing your time may help you relieve some of the anxiety you feel about getting everything done. Daily tasks you'll need to make time for include making the bed, sorting the mail, and sweeping or vacuuming the floor. Other daily tasks should be performed as you go along. These include putting things away (to prevent clutter from developing), cleaning up as you cook, and wiping up fresh spills.\n2. Make a weekly schedule. Some chores only need to be done once or twice a week. Instead of rushing around to get these chores done all at once, plan on doing a little each day and set aside certain days for certain tasks. You'll likely feel more relaxed about getting things done, which means you'll do a better, more thorough job. Clean the bathrooms once a week. Make sure that you wash all bath linens and scrub all toilets, tubs, and sinks. Empty the trash, clean the mirrors, dust the lights, and wipe up the floor. The bedrooms in your home also need a thorough weekly cleaning. Put away anything that has been sitting out on a desk or side table. Clean all sheets, pillowcases, and blankets. Empty the trash, dust all the surfaces, and vacuum the floor. You may need to vacuum your living room, kitchen, and dining room every day or two, but other chores, like dusting, washing rugs/mats, and wiping mirrors, can be done once a week.\n3. Experiment with different cleaning products. Not every household cleaner is just as good as every other. Moreover, different types of cleaners may work better on different areas of your home. If there is some part of your usual cleaning routine that leaves a lot to be desired, figure out why your current cleaner is not doing the job right and research which options might be better. Compare chemical and organic products. Nowadays, many people prefer cleaning products made from natural ingredients instead of chemical cleaners. Natural cleaners have their own pros and cons, just as chemical cleaners have, but it doesn't hurt to include a few organic products among those you plan on testing out. Ask your friends for suggestions or do some research online about your different options. Test a few different products out on a trial basis. Pay close attention to which products work best with different materials\u2014wood, glass, ceramic, plastic, and so on.\n4. Be handy. The modern domestic goddess needs to know a bit more about the handy side of home care than earlier counterparts did. You don't need to know how to maintain all the systems and utilities in your home, but learning how to take care of a few basic projects is a wise move. At minimum, your home tool kit should contain a hammer and a few different screwdrivers. These tools will allow you to do simple tasks like hanging pictures and making small repairs to things like toys, cabinets, and drawers.\n5. Organize your realm. Clutter is the natural enemy of any domestic goddess. If you want to maintain a living space that any mortal would be envious of, you need to keep things orderly and in their place. Brush up on space-saving techniques and similar skills to keep your belongings in check. This is especially important if you're dealing with limited space. Get rid of any unnecessary junk first, then organize everything that has a purpose in a way that makes sense based on your needs.\n6. Master the laundry. Laundry is one chore that you will never be able to avoid if you want to be a domestic goddess. Your current laundry skills might be adequate, but you should still continue to watch out for aspects of your laundry routine that could stand to use improvement. Consider assigning different laundry tasks to different days, as well. For instance, you can clean bathroom towels on Tuesday, bed sheets and pillowcases on Wednesday, and any other miscellaneous towels or blankets on Thursday. Clothing will need to be cleaned throughout the week, though. Read the labels before you wash something and follow the laundering instructions provided. If you aren't sure whether or not an item will bleed color in the washing machine, test it by soaking a small spot and blotting that spot with a white cloth. Wash colors and whites separately. Also separate heavily soiled items and wash those on their own. Pretreat stains and presoak heavily soiled garments in a sink or bucket of water for 30 minutes before washing them. Use the recommended amount of detergent and select the best washer cycle for each individual load. Base water temperature and dryer settings on color and fabric type. Materials that can shrink should be washed in warm or cold water and air dried, for instance. Cold water is best for bright colors, while hot water works well for whites.\n7. Learn a few tricks. Once you've mastered the basics, keep an eye out for various tips and tricks that can take your home skills from \u201cgreat\u201d to \u201camazing.\u201d Some tricks work better than others, though, so you should test them out before bragging to your friends about your newfound knowledge. For instance, cover dirty stroller wheels and wagon wheels with plastic shower caps before bringing the item inside. Wrap pipe cleaners around the neck of condiment bottles to catch drips and prevent crusty build-up. Stuff holes in the wall and cabinets with steel wool to keep mice and other pests out.\n\n\n## Part two: in the kitchen\n\n1. Get off to an easy start. If you currently have some cooking and baking knowledge, then you're off to a good start already. If not, start small by making simple meals and following easy recipes. You can gradually build up your kitchen skills as you get more comfortable, but trying too much all at once is a good way to fail and get discouraged. Look for books specifically aimed at beginners or search for easy recipes online. Instructions that provide step-by-step pictures are often the easiest to follow along.\n2. Take a class. Look for free and cheap cooking classes in your area. Focus on developing skills that you're specifically interested in developing, and skip any class that will teach you something you already know or will teach you something you have no desire to learn. Local craft stores often offer classes on baking and food decorating. Small markets may have classes on cooking essentials. Check out cooking schools in your area. Even if you don't want to spend time and money on a cooking program, some of these schools offer one-time cooking courses at a discounted price.\n3. Find your niche. Not every domestic goddess needs to love cooking, but learning to enjoy it can motivate you into improving your skills. Try to find something about cooking or baking that you can feel passionate\u2014or at least interested\u2014about. Build up your cooking skills in general, but involve your point of interest as much as possible while doing so. Your passion might be something simple, like baking cookies or mastering stovetop cooking. On the other hand, you might find your attention grabbed by something a little more unique, like gluten-free baking or canning.\n4. Make any necessary adjustments. You might have a full set of cooking and baking skills when all is said and done, but that doesn't mean you will be able to show them all off each and every day. Know when to make a simple meal and when to whip up something more impressive. Learning how to use your cooking to improve and please those you're cooking for is another skill you will need to master. For example, if you're cooking for picky kids, focus on choosing kid-friendly meals instead of trying to impress them with an elaborate meal they won't even eat. When you're cooking for guests, find out about any food allergies or special diets ahead of time and plan your menu accordingly.\n5. Experiment. Once you feel comfortable enough in the kitchen, start using the skills and knowledge you have gained to experiment with your own recipes and tasty creations. Some experiments might be a success while others will likely be a failure. The important thing is simply to keep working at it until your successes vastly outnumber your failures.\n\n\n## Part three: sew and other \"lost\" skills\n\n1. Master the basics of sewing. Sewing is the queen of lost skills, so if you don't know even the most basic stitches, you really aren't alone. At minimum, though, you should know how to sew hems, repair small rips and tears, and attach buttons. Learn a variety of basic stitches, including the straight stitch, the back stitch, the zigzag stitch, and the basting stitch. Invest in a sewing machine. As your sewing skills improve, consider buying a sewing machine of your own. You will probably be glad that you did. Fixing garments and creating projects from scratch will both be much easier if you learn to machine sew as well as hand sew.\n2. Get crafty. Sewing is not the only lost skill worth learning, of course. There is a wide range of other crafts and domestic abilities you can explore. You do not need to master all of them, but picking one or two you'd like to become great at can improve your standing as a domestic goddess. Potential areas of interest could include gardening, crocheting, or knitting. You could also check out community craft websites, like Pinterest, to get more ideas.\n3. Take classes. You can learn a lot by teaching yourself, but sometimes, the best way to learn a new skill or to advance an old one is to take an actual class on it. Look for cheap classes in your area or sign up for a class online.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally conscious individual who is passionate about sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint.

{"conversations": ["How to wear long coats?", "A long coat is a nice item to have in any closet, especially for people living in colder climates. There is a variety of styles of long coats as well as ways you can wear them. Make your long coat work for you by finding a style that fits you, dressing it down for casual daily wear, or adding it on top of a dressy outfit for a formal occasion.\n\n## Choose the right coat\n\n1. Try a fit-and-flare coat for the illusion of a thinner waist. For a long coat that hides a thick waist, try a fit-and-flare style. These coats fit tighter around the waist and then flare out at the hips. The tops are often double-breasted, and there are strategically placed seams on them to create a thinner look. Solid black and vertical stripes also make people look thinner. Experiment with these colors if you\u2019re concerned about making your waist look thinner.\n2. Balance out wide hips with a voluminous collar on your coat. If you\u2019d like to create the illusion of smaller hips, choose a coat that has a large collar such as a shawl collar or large faux-fur collar. The volume of the collar will draw attention away from the bottom half of your coat.\n3. Add curves to a narrow frame with a belted coat. Belts add dimension to long, straight coats. Look for a long coat with a thick wrap-around belt if you\u2019d like to make your thin frame look curvier. Subtle pleats around the waist also help to add curves. Colors and patterns that add dimension for a thin person include light colors and plaid.\n4. Hide a rounder belly with a full-length men\u2019s coat. Most younger men today wear knee-length long coats, but that length looks best on trim men who can wear a more form-fitting coat. Full-length coats go past the knee to the mid-calf, and are nice for disguising a heavier figure. Full-length coats are also considerably warmer, so they are ideal for cold climates.\n5. Go with a double-breasted knee-length coat if you\u2019re petite. Long coats can easily swallow up a short person. A way to solve this is to keep the coat around knee-length or just past your knees. Double-breasted coats with a large envelope collar keep a proportioned look to a longer coat worn on a petite person. If you are of an average or taller height, you can easily pull off full-length coats that go past the knee to your mid-calf or below.\n6. Do the hug test to make sure the coat isn\u2019t too small. It\u2019s easy to buy a long coat that\u2019s too small because the length of the coat may make you think it fits you. To check, try the coat on and wrap your arms around yourself, trying to touch the opposite shoulder with each hand. If the coat feels really tight in the shoulders or elbows, you should go with the next size up. You can also check the sleeve length by holding your arms straight out in front of you. If the sleeves go up 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) past your wrists, you probably need the next size up. The sleeve end should fall within 1 in (2.5 cm) of you wrist when your arms are up, and go almost to your knuckles when they are down.\n7. Check that the shoulder seams line up with your shoulders. On a properly fitting coat, the shoulder seams should line up with your shoulders. If they go down near your biceps, the coat is either too big or it is supposed to have an oversized shape to it. Either try on the next size down, or confirm that oversized is the style that you\u2019re going for. Consider getting a coat tailored for you if cannot find a coat that fits correctly across your chest and shoulders as well as the length of your arms.\n8. Choose a wool coat for the longest winter wear. Long coats come in a variety of fabrics, but if you\u2019re planning to wear your coat for a long time during the winter, invest in 100% wool or a wool-cashmere blend. Coats made with all cashmere tend to show wear much faster. If you intend to wear your jacket in fall, spring, or summer weather, you have more options for fabric, including cotton and twill.\n\n\n## Wear a long coat casually\n\n1. Wear a black coat with ripped jeans and sneakers for a go-anywhere look. Long black coats are versatile because they can be casual or formal. Pair yours with ripped blue or black skinny jeans, a fitted graphic T-shirt, and your favorite sneakers. Plain white sneakers are a popular classic with this look, but you can experiment with vintage, black and white, or skate style sneakers to individualize the style.\n2. Pair baggy trousers with an oversized maxi coat and sunglasses for comfort. If you\u2019re looking to stay both comfortable and warm this winter, wear baggy black trousers rolled at the ankles with a cozy V-neck shirt under any color oversized maxi coat. Grey is a popular coat color for this look, but you can try navy or even a patterned coat. Sunglasses pull off the chic casual style of this look. Go with plain black glasses of any shape that you like. Try this look with either white sneakers or laced ankle boots.\n3. Wear a floor length coat with flared denim as an elegant-casual crossover. Floor-length coats take the classic long coat a few steps further; you can pull off a very cute, elegant casual look by pairing one with flared denim jeans. Wear this with an oversized knit sweater and dressy boots to complete the look. Add large sunglasses and a scarf to this look for extra flare.\n4. Try a long camel coat with a scarf for an intellectual touch. Long camel coats have an automatically sophisticated feel to them and are popular in the fall. Pair yours with black skinny jeans and a wide oversized scarf to look ready to hit the books. Complete this look with crisp white low-cut sneakers, a sweater, and pair of glasses.\n5. Add a beanie to any long coat for a fun casual look. Take the seriousness out of a long coat by adding a slouchy beanie on your head. Wear jeans or sweatpants, a long-sleeved T-shirt, and a pair of ankle boots or sneakers to finish off this casual style.\n6. Make an extra-long coat punk with colorful lace-up ankle boots. To achieve an 80s punk-inspired look, wear black skinny jeans and a button-down shirt with combat style boots under a mid-calf coat. To really finish off this look, add a few 1 inch (2.5 cm) band pins, or badges, to the lapels of your coat. Wear a pair of black sunglasses with this look to give it an extra rock-star vibe.\n7. Pair a pale maxi coat with cropped denim and a white T-shirt in the spring. Long coats aren\u2019t just for fall and winter; you can pair lighter long jackets with a variety of spring looks as well. Try a pale blue, pink, or white long coat with light blue cropped jeans or shorts. Add a colorful fitted T-shirt and sandals to complete the look. Instead of denim, wear a short spring sundress and casual sandals under your light long coat for cute but informal effect.\n\n\n## Dress up with a long coat\n\n1. Wear a long coat over black cigarette pants and heels for a sophisticated look. A long coat that\u2019s camel, grey, navy, red, or patterned looks great over top of black cigarette pants and heels. Wear a black blouse with this outfit, and try to match your heels with the coat for the best effect. For example, a camel coat with this outfit looks elegant with a pair of shiny nude heels.\n2. Try a long faux-fur coat with strappy heels for an elegant edge. No need to spend lots of money on real fur \u2013 there are many nice faux fur options out there for coats. Choose a black or white faux-fur coat and pair it with strappy heels, a short or mid-length skirt, or capris pants for an elegant look. Either chunky or stiletto heels work for this look; just make sure they are high and strappy.\n3. Pair leather leggings and heels with an extra-long black coat for serious glam. Find yourself a pair of black faux leather leggings and combine them with black heels of your choice for a glamourous look. Wear a simple white blouse underneath to finish off this look. Add a pair of classic large black sunglasses to this look for some extra glam.\n4. Wear a long unbuttoned coat over a cocktail dress for a night out. Go with a plain button-down black coat over a dark colored dress in the winter, or pair a lightweight camel trench coat over a light-colored or floral dress in the summer. Add heels to match your dress and jewelry to be ready for any formal occasion.\n5. Wear a Paletot or Guards\u2019 coat for versatility. The Paletot and Guards\u2019 coat styles are classic business coats for men that can be worn for any formal occasion. They are double-breasted with 2 rows of 6 buttons and peaked lapels. Navy blue or charcoal colors of this coat can be worn to a business meeting, over a tuxedo, or to a funeral.\n6. Pair a fitted long coat with dress trousers and loafers for any formal occasion. Dress trousers and shiny loafers, paired with a tucked button-down shirt, look sharp under any fitted long coat. Match your trousers to the coat and choose a dark colored shirt in the winter, or a lighter colored shirt in the summer. Add a tie that compliments your shirt to make this look extra formal.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "a fashion enthusiast, fashion blogger, or someone who frequently attends formal events.

It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries. And it creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production.\nSo in most cases, protecting the environment and promoting economic growth go hand-in-hand.

In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\u201d\n\nIt's pretty clear from the above verses that John was Elijah reincarnated.\nWouldn't the above verses imply that reincarnation is true? ", "Faulty Premise #1: John the Baptist was a reincarnation of Elijah\n\nWhen Jesus asked Peter who people said he was, he answered that some people thought that Jesus was Elijah come back. Peter knew better and said Jesus was the Christ. In any event, John the Baptist himself directly denied the claim (see John 1:19-21). \nWhat Jesus more likely was saying in Matthew 11 is that John the Baptist was a prophet in the tradition of Elijah. Elijah was the greatest of the prophets (even if his disciple Elisha inherited a double portion of his spirit). All of the prophets that followed came in the name and spirit of Elijah, in the same way that some of Paul's letters apparently were created after his death. They were in the spirit and tradition even if not the actual man. \nNote also Elijah never died - he was taken up into heaven, and people thought he would return. As such, no Elijah was not being thought to have reincarnated- only returned. Elijah's return was long a part of Jewish custom. Even today, during a Passover sedar, a chair is left empty for Elijah. But again, since he did not die, Jews look for his return, not his reincarnation. \n\nFaulty Premise #2: The Jewish world view has  any concept of reincarnation at all\n\nThe most basic rule of hermeneutics suggests that a text cannot mean what it could not mean to the original audience. If the Jews had no concept of reincarnation, then any interpretation that says it does has a very, very high bar to clear.\nIn his book The Gift of the Jews, Thomas Cahill advances the thesis that the primary distinctive philosophy of the Jews was precisely that history was not circular. Their linear idea of a human life was a departure from others and was an explicit rejection of reincarnation. As such, a text would need to be exceedingly explicit to a culture that rejected circular life patterns, and the obscure interpretation above (especially in light of the more obvious intepretation) simply doesn't hold water.\nFurthermore, the book of Hebrews - written to the people into which both Jesus and John the Baptist were born - explicitly reject reincarnation. As the writer points out in 9:27, \n\n  It is appointed unto a man once to die and then the judgement.\n\nHere we do have an explicit rejection of reincarnation by the followers of Jesus.

{"conversations": ["How to backpack in the rain?", "## Deal with a sudden storm\n\n1. Put on any protective gear that you\u2019ve brought. All hikers should carry lightweight rain gear or at least a poncho in case of rain. If you don\u2019t have these items, try to use what you do have, such as an extra garbage back that you carried just in case or a tarp.\n2. Keep your body moving. Even if you\u2019re trying to stay out of the rain, move around as you wait so that your body stays warmer. For example, march in place or step side to side. Hypothermia can easily set in if you get too cold, so generate as much body heat as you can.\n3. Seek shelter. Look around you for a place to duck out of the rain, such as a tree canopy, a cave, a cabin, or even your tent. If you plan on camping and have a waterproof tent, you may find that settling in early and riding out the storm is the best solution. If you hear thunder, seek immediate shelter. Staying outside during a thunder storm is dangerous.\n4. Watch for changes in the terrain. Rain can cause flooding, mud slides, rock slides, and slippery trails, all of which can be very dangerous. Look for signs such as flowing water, rising tide lines, shifting soil, and a sheen on the surface of the trail. When in doubt, walk away from the questionable terrain.\n5. Stay away from open fields, elevated areas, and water. If you\u2019re caught in a lightning storm, the most dangerous places to be include open areas, hills, mountains, trees, cliffs, and waterways. Lightning is most likely to strike these areas, so avoid them. If you\u2019re in the woods, try to find a small grove of trees that are surrounded by other taller trees. Tuck yourself in the lowest spot you can find. If you are stuck in an open area, look for the lowest spot, crouch down, and keep most of your body from touching the ground. Ideally, just the soles of your feet will make contact with the ground. If you have access to a vehicle, stay inside of it but try not to touch the sides of the car.\n6. Put down your trekking poles or other long objects. In a lightning storm, trekking poles and long, pointy objects make a great conductor for the lightning and are therefore very dangerous. Protect yourself by laying these items on the ground away from you.\n7. Pay attention to changing weather. Check the forecast before and during your trek, and watch for signs of a coming storm. If winds pick up and the sky becomes overcast, consider changing your route so that you can reach safety before the storm hits. It\u2019s better to cut your trek short and have the storm pass over rather than get caught in dangerous weather.\n\n\n## Plan a trek in a rainy environment\n\n1. Choose the right insulation for rainy weather. If you wear natural insulators like down or clothing made from cotton, the water seeps into the fabric and takes away the warmth. These fabrics can pull the heat from your body. Wool, fleece, and synthetics stay warm even in a downpour, so they are a better option if you know the weather will be rainy.\n2. Dress in layers. Stay warm by wearing long sleeved wool, polyester, or microfiber clothing under your rain gear. If the weather will also be cooler, add multiple layers. Your clothes will likely still get wet under your rain gear, but fabrics like wool and fleece can remain warm. On the other hand, you may want to look for items that dry easily, such as polyester. Choose items that will feel comfortable and flexible under your heavy raincoat. Avoid cotton, which will hold the water and drain your heat.\n3. Wear a hard shell raincoat and rain pants. A hard shell raincoat will hold up better than a soft shell raincoat in a sustained storm. You can protect your legs with rain pants or vented pants, depending on the temperature of the area and your preference as a hiker. Vented pants will be less insulating but dry quickly. Rain pants can help keep in your warmth and repel water, but they will eventually succumb to the onslaught of water.\n4. Choose the right shoes. For shorter backpacking trips, waterproof boots and gaiters are your best bet, while longer trips are best accomplished with breathable trail runners. If you\u2019re in the rain for long periods of time, your feet are going to get wet no matter what shoe you wear. Trail runners are easier on your feet and dry quicker than other options.\n5. Wear a hat. Your weakest link in staying warm is your head. Even with a hood, heat will escape from your head. Keep your head warm by wearing a hat. If you choose a hat that has a brim, you can also keep some of the rain off your face.\n6. Use a waterproof bag or use a pack cover. While they\u2019re expensive, waterproof bags far outrank pack covers in keeping your gear dry. A pack cover can easily be compromised by a wayward branch, which can pull off the cover. Additionally, water can still seep into the unprotected back of the bag. While a waterproof pack is preferable, a pack cover is better than nothing. Line the inside of your bag with a heavy-duty garbage bag.\n7. Protect your gear inside plastic bags. Protect items that need to stay dry, such as food, electronics, your map, your light source, etc. into plastic Ziplock bags, heavy-duty trash bags, or dry bags made for backpackers. If you are carrying a sleeping bag, tent, or other related items, make sure they are protected as well.\n8. Pack a set of dry clothes. If you\u2019re camping, make sure that you have a set of dry clothes to sleep in so that you can change out of your wet gear overnight. Not only will you be more comfortable, but it will help you keep your body temperature regulated. Store your dry clothes in plastic with your other dry gear.\n\n\n## Stay safe on rainy trail\n\n1. Choose a good trail. If you know that the weather will be rainy, choose an area that you can enjoy in the rain, such as a trek through the forest. Consider visibility and safety, since waterways can flood and rocks can become slippery. When in doubt, plan to keep your hiking short and bed down early.\n2. Avoid opening your pack. Each time you open your pack water drips in. Even if it\u2019s only a small amount of water, it can quickly compromise your pack. The water will remain in your waterproofed pack for the entire trek, so don\u2019t risk lugging around the unnecessary weight. Store frequently needed items and your snacks in pockets or in dry bags attached to the outside of your pack.\n3. Make sure that your map stays dry. If you don\u2019t have a waterproof map, then make sure that your map never gets wet. Ideally, it should be secured in a plastic see-through bag. Try not to remove it when it\u2019s exposed to rain.\n4. Snack often. Regularly munching on snacks will help you keep your body warmer, which is important when you\u2019re getting wet. Rain can cause hypothermia if you get too cool, so plan to eat more often than on a dry hike.\n5. Apply oils to your feet. The wetness from your socks can rub away your natural skin oils, which is what causes blisters. Applying a light salve to your feet can help prevent this from happening. Carry a salve and smooth it onto your feet when you settle in for the night.\n6. Stay hydrated. When it\u2019s raining, some hikers forget to drink their water. Even if you don\u2019t feel thirsty, make sure that you\u2019re sipping on your water to keep yourself hydrated. Dehydration can quickly become an issue.\n7. Take short breaks. Rainy weather makes breaks less desirable because it allows your body to cool down, causing you to be cold and uncomfortable. You also have the incentive to keep going until you reach your destination and can get out of the rain. However, not taking breaks can easily tire you out. Stay energized by taking shorter breaks than you normally would but more often. For example, if you would normally take a 15-minute break after hiking for an hour and a half, take a five-minute break every 30 minutes.\n8. Avoid placing wet gear in your tent. When you do stop to camp, keep your wet items separate from your dry items. Carrying wet gear into your tent can easily lead to everything being wet. Instead, cover up your gear and leave it outside the tent.\n9. Give your feet a chance to dry. When you stop to camp or to take an extended break, take off your shoes so that your feet have a chance to dry out. If you have dry socks, put them on. Otherwise, leave your feet bare. This will help keep your skin healthy and avoid blisters.\n10. Watch for the signs of hypothermia. Rain can lead to hypothermia, even if it\u2019s not very cold out. Stay safe by monitoring yourself for signs of hypothermia. If you do notice any, take steps to warm yourself, such as pitching camp and changing your wet clothes for dry ones. Symptoms of mild hypothermia include shivering, slurred speech, tiredness, cool or pale skin, and shallow breathing. Symptoms of moderate hypothermia include confusion, drowsiness, tiredness, shallow breathing, cold or pale skin, ceasing of shivering, and shedding clothes despite being cold.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An outdoor enthusiast or hiker with experience in backpacking, particularly in wet or rainy conditions.

{"conversations": ["How to identify ticks?", "While tick bites are not often painful, they can lead to infections or even chronic illnesses like Lyme disease. If you're uncertain whether you're dealing with a tick infestation, check for defining features that distinguish a tick from other bugs. Some bugs that look like ticks are harmless, but ticks must be dealt with immediately to avoid illness or infection. Call an exterminator if you're still not sure for a professional opinion.\n\n## Check for distinctive tick feature\n\n1. Look for a round, ovular shape. Before a tick is engorged with blood, its body is shaped like an oval with 2 major segments. After a tick is engorged, its head will remain small but its body will grow round and plump.\n2. Check for bugs that are between \u20442 to 2 in (1.3 to 5.1 cm) long. How large a tick is when you find it depends on whether it has recently fed on blood. Before it has drunk any blood, a tick will be around the size of a pinhead. Immediately to several hours afterward, a tick will grow to around the size of a lima bean.\n3. Examine its exterior for a protective hard body. In most cases, ticks have a hard exoskeleton. These are called hard or \"authentic\" ticks and are usually what people are talking about when describing ticks. Soft ticks with a flexible exoskeleton exist but are only found in select areas. Soft ticks are found in the western United States and southwestern Canada.\n4. Check for a star-shaped design on its back. Lone star ticks have a white, star-shaped design on their exoskeletons. If a bug does not have this design, it still may be a tick. This pattern is just a defining feature of this tick species.\n5. Examine the bug for black legs. Black-legged ticks, as suggested by their name, have legs that are darker than their bodies. Like a lone star tick's black legs, this is a defining characteristic of black-legged ticks and may not be present on every tick.\n\n\n## Differentiate between tick and other bug\n\n1. Avoid mistaking bugs with wings or antennae for ticks. Ticks do not have wings, nor do they have antennae. If you have found a bug with either, it is not a tick. Research bugs with similar characteristics to ticks but with wings or antennae if your bug in question has these. Poplar weevils, which are commonly mistaken for ticks, have both wings and antennae.\n2. Count the number of legs to distinguish it from insects. Because ticks are a type of arachnid, like spiders and scorpions, they have 8 legs. If your bug has 6, it is an insect and therefore not a tick. If your bug has less than 6 or more than 8 legs, it is neither an insect nor arachnid but is, regardless, not a tick.\n3. Watch for bugs that feed on blood and do not travel in groups. Billbugs are the commonly mistaken for ticks because of their near-identical appearance. The way to distinguish between a tick and a billbug is to watch them. Billbugs swarm in groups, whereas ticks are usually alone. Ticks also feed on blood, whereas billbugs do not. As a general rule, billbugs do not hang around or on people and animals. Ticks often do.\n4. Look for bugs that burrow in the skin instead of resting on its surface. Both ticks and bed bugs hang around animals and humans. Their method of feeding off of people and animals, however, differs. Ticks burrow into the skin to drink a living creature's blood but bed bugs stay on the skin's surface. Make sure you know whether a bug is a tick or bed bug before removing it from your skin. Without proper precautions, you may remove a tick's body while its head remains lodged in your skin.\n\n\n## Identify tick bite\n\n1. Check for mild pain around the bite. Tick bites are not usually painful. If you experience sharp pain, you have not likely been bitten by a tick. Research your other symptoms to determine what insect or arachnid bit you and begin treatment. If a soft tick bites you, you might notice localized pain immediately after the tick drops off.\n2. Inspect the site for redness. Although tick bites are not painful, they can still set off your body's immune system. If the bite and the skin surrounding it looks reddish, it may be a tick bite. Keep in mind, however, that redness is a symptom of many bug bites.\n3. Watch for rash development in the days and weeks following your bite. While not often a symptom of tick bites, you may develop a rash if your tick bite becomes infected or if you contracted an illness from the tick bite. If a rash spreads from your tick bite to other parts of your body, call your doctor or visit an urgent care clinic. Some illnesses that ticks carry, like Lyme disease, can take months or years before symptoms develop.\n4. Look for a tick still attached to your body. Because tick bites usually do not hurt, the most common way to spot a tick bite is to see the tick burrowed in your skin. Compare the bug on your body to other insects before removing it so you can use a pair of tweezers or a credit card to safely get it out of your skin. If you are not careful, tick heads can remain lodged in your skin.\n5. Recognize tick bite symptoms that require immediate medical care. While most tick bites can be treated at home, you may need emergency care if you develop an infection or allergic reaction. Seek emergency medical help immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms:\n\t* Raised red bumps (hives) all over your body\n\t* Trouble breathing\n\t* Swelling of the mouth, lips, tongue, or throat\n\t* Lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual who is concerned about their health and outdoor activities, such as hikers, campers, or gardeners.

I am then given another ciphertext that I should decrypt.\nI know that XOR-ing two ciphers gives me the XOR of their original messages.\nMy question is what is the correct thing to do after that?\nI tried to take 3 ciphertexts $C_1, C_2$ and $C_3$.\nThen get $S_1 = C_1 \\oplus C_2  \\oplus $```' '```, also get $S_2 = C_1 \\oplus C_3 \\oplus$ ```' '```.\nAfter that I compared all corresponding characters in $S_1$ and $S_2$,\nand if $S_1[i] = S_2[i]$ then I calculate $S_1[i] \\oplus C_2[i]$ to get $K[i]$.\nI tried this on paper before coding and it worked, but I might be missing something.\nIs this the right approach? Why does it work?", "The classical answer to \"what is the correct thing to do after you have the XOR of the two original messages\" is crib-dragging.\n\nThat is, you take a guess of a common phrase that may appear in one of the plaintexts (the classical example against ASCII english is the 5 letter \" the \"), and exclusive-or that against the XOR of the two original messages in various locations.  If one of the plaintexts had the text of the crib (\" the \" in our example), then the result of the exclusive-or is what the other plaintext had in that position; if neither plaintext had that, it's likely that the result of the exclusive-or is just gibberish.  And, once you have a plausible short section, you can extend it (for example, if you know that one of the plaintexts is \" na**\", you can go through the dictionary of all words that start with \"na\", use those as cribs, and see which makes the other plaintext make sense).\n\nIn addition, you can often deduce things directly from the bit pattern.  For example, if the messages are in ASCII, then one thing to note that bit 6 of letters is set, but bit 6 of spaces, numbers and (most) punctuation is clear; because spaces are far more common than numbers and punctuation, then that will give you a good guess of where spaces occur in the texts (albeit without telling you which message a specific space appears in).\n\nNow, if you have 11 messages all encrypted with the same pad (an \"11-time pad\"), things get even easier.  Obviously, you can grab a crib across one message, and check it against the other 10; if it makes all 10 make sense, then it is almost certainly accurate.  Even better, by using the observation that you can distinguish spaces from letters (again, by comparing bit 6), you can find where all the spaces appear in the messages; these all act like 1 character cribs, probably revealing virtually all the text of all the messages."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A student or self-taught individual with a basic understanding of cryptography, specifically One-Time Pad (OTP), who is seeking guidance on attacking a two-time pad and verifying their approach to the problem.

{"conversations": ["How to feel happy when christmas is over?", "Christmas season is filled with excitement and fun. Families come together to celebrate and exchange gifts, and decorations change the landscape of cities and towns. Once the holiday is over, however, the lack of excitement can leave you feeling down. Get back into a good mood by being thankful for your good times, planning for the next holiday or picking up a new hobby.\n\n## Be thankful\n\n1. Reflect on the holiday. When you feel sad that the holiday is over, cheer yourself up by thinking about all of the good times that you had. There are bound to be a lot of great memories from the holiday, so focus on those when you feel upset. Go through photographs from the holiday. If you're from a family that takes a lot of photographs or videos of family gatherings, look through some of them if you're feeling low after the holidays. They'll be a great reminder of all of the fun you had. Talk to the people you celebrated with. It's never to early to begin reminiscing. Speak with your friends and family members that celebrated with you and talk about the good times at Christmas. They're bound to be able to cheer you up with a funny story from the holiday.\n2. Get excited about your gifts. While gifts aren't the only good thing about the holidays, they can make make you happy when you're sad about the holiday ending. Play with toys or gadgets, read books, and make use of all of the gifts you've been given. They'll be a welcome distraction.\n3. Spend your Christmas money. If you received money or gift cards, go out and treat yourself. You'll be cheered up by new purchases, and you may be able to forget that the holiday is over. Go out to eat or visit stores for a good distraction.\n4. Write thank you notes. Send messages to the people who got you gifts and thank them for a great holiday. Not only will you be doing a good deed, but you'll be recalling memories of the times that made you happy. Use the notes to talk about how much you enjoyed the holidays, and how you can't wait to spend time together next year.\n\n\n## Plan for the next holiday\n\n1. Replace decorations. Decorations are one of the best parts of Christmas, but if you leave them up, it may make you even more sad that the holiday is over. Even worse, the empty walls left behind by decorations you've stored may make you feel even more sad. Find creative ways to redecorate your house now that the holiday is over. Buy some plants. Greenery will spruce up your home, and you'll be able to care for the plants throughout the coming spring. Buy a new poster or painting. Large Christmas decorations like wreaths or wall-hangings can be replaced with a new poster or painting. Look for something colorful and exciting to accent your home. With a new piece of art where your decorations were, you may not even notice that your wreath is gone. Put up pictures from Christmas. Replace some of your Christmas decorations with photos from the holiday. You'll have a reminder of the good times to replace the actual decorations. Decorate for winter. Winter can be a beautiful time of year if you learn to appreciate it. Decorate your home for the season with a lot of white items, vases accented with twigs, snowflake decorations and evergreen sprigs.\n2. Plan for New Year's. Christmas may be over, but New Years is right around the corner. Plan a New Years party to get into the spirit of a different holiday. Invite any family and friends that visited for Christmas and you'll get to spend more time with them.\n3. Plan for next Christmas. While it may seem a little early to be get ready for another Christmas, it may be helpful to think about what your next Christmas will be like. Make some invitations, and plan what gifts you will give to others. Your plans might change throughout the course of the year, but you'll be able to make your plans into a good distraction.\n\n\n## Pick up a new hobby\n\n1. Exercise. Exercising will put you in a much better mood and help you burn off some of the extra Christmas-food calories. Go for a jog, lift weights or play a sport with some friends. If you live in a cold climate, January might be too chilly for much outdoor activity, so look into a gym membership or indoor sports leagues.\n2. Start a new hobby. If you've received any hobby-oriented Christmas gifts like paints, kitchen utensils or a new video game, put them to use. Throwing yourself into a new hobby and learning a new skill will help take your mind off of your sadness.\n3. Volunteer. Volunteering can help you keep your Christmas spirit alive as you help those in need. Look into helping out local soup kitchens, shelters or charities that distribute winter clothes. You'll be able to help others through the winter and take your mind off of the end of the Christmas season.\n4. Try to keep a positive attitude. While it may be depressing that Christmas is over, always try to keep up a good attitude. Remember that this Christmas isn't the last one you'll ever have, and focus on things that make you happy as much as possible. It may be especially hard to keep a positive attitude if you have to go back to work. However, think of your return to work as a blank slate and new beginning.

{"conversations": ["Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20\u00b0C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.", "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp. Perparing food outside in the cold takes a lot longer than in a heated kitchen, severly limits what you can do, and may also risk predator encounters depending on what is around your area in the winter."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A young, adventurous, and environmentally conscious individual embarking on an unconventional living experiment in Stockholm.

Once they're ready, using scissors can be an excellent way for the child to build fine motor skills and patience.\n\n## Prepare to teach\n\n1. Try fine motor skill activities to prepare the child for using scissors. Children need to build fine motor skills before they're ready to use scissors. Here are some activities that can help build the child's skills, and help you know if the child is ready:\n\t* Precision: Squeezing watercolor paint from an eyedropper onto paper, playing with finger puppets\n\t* \n\t* Bilateral coordination: Tearing up paper from the recycling bin\n\t* \n\t* Finger and hand strength: Spinning a top, punching holes with a hole punch, playing with squirt guns, using clothes pins\n2. Evaluate the child's ability to follow directions. The child should be able to follow instructions like \"stop\" or \"put it down, please.\" If a child isn't able to follow safety rules, then they shouldn't be given anything dangerous.\n3. Choose the right pair of scissors. Safety scissors are ideal for young children. Choose right-handed or left-handed scissors based on your child's dominant hand.\n4. Know that most kids are ready to use scissors around the age of 2 or 3. Many young children are able to use scissors.Talk to an occupational therapist if you think your child is struggling or has a disability that might delay their learning to use scissors. There are adaptive scissors for kids with disabilities, and special techniques to help kids who struggle with scissors. A delay isn't the end of the world. It just means things will happen a little differently.\n\n\n## Teach how to use scissor\n\n1. Let the child see you use a scissors. Show them how you do it, and let them watch. If they're curious, then you'll know they're most likely ready to learn.\n2. Start with the grip. Show the child in your hand how to hold the scissors, and then have them try to copy it. If they aren't able to alone, help move their fingers and thumb into the right position. Teach them that the thumb always goes in the hole. Draw an eyeball on the small thumb hole and explain that the eyeball will always be on top. Teach them that two fingers in the larger hole. Help them put their index finger and their middle finger in the hole.\n3. Have the child practice opening and closing the scissors. This practice will help the child build up the strength to control the scissors.\n4. Try having the child do their best to cut in a line or other shapes. Try drawing lines or shapes for the child to cut. After they do it, praise them. (Keep in mind that they may not be very precise yet; they're still young.)\n5. Find ways to make it fun. Let the child be creative. Try letting them cut colored paper, yarn, and other materials. Using scissors can be another way the child works on expressing themselves (all while building essential motor skills).\n6. Practice with the child how to turn the paper with one hand and cut with the other. This will prevent the child from turning the scissors up side down. Show the how to move the paper along with shuffling motions so that they maintain control of both the paper and the scissors.\n\n\n## Teach scissor safety\n\n1. Tell the child that scissors can hurt people if misused. It helps if kids don't just know what the rules are, but if they know why the rules are important. Explain that using scissors the wrong way can result in somebody getting hurt, and that's why the rules matter. Tell them that as long as they are following the rules, they don't have to worry.\n2. Explain that scissors are only for cutting paper. Fingers, hair, clothing, crayons, and other things are off-limits. If you decide to have the child practice with cutting Play Doh first, you can say that scissors are only for paper and Play Doh.If the child asks about why scissors are used for haircuts, explain \"Only adults can use scissors to cut hair, because they have more practice to make sure they don't mess up. Some adults go to a hair cutting school to learn how to do it right, and once they go there, they're allowed to cut hair.\"\n3. Explain that you need to walk carefully with scissors, if at all. Scissors can hurt people, so it's important to be careful. Some adults forbid walking with scissors at all, while others allow children to do it if the kids are careful. The best way to walk with scissors is to hold the closed blades in the fist. Walking this way reduces the risk of the child playing with the blades while walking, or falling and hurting themselves on the blades. Explain that running with scissors is extremely dangerous. If the child is going too fast, say \"Walking feet\" to remind them to slow down. Take away the scissors if they continue behaving dangerously.\n4.

{"conversations": ["How to open your locker?", "If there are lockers with locks at your school, you'll probably want to get used to opening yours quickly. Don't worry; it gets easier with practice. See Step 1 to begin learning how to open 99% of all standard school lockers.\n\n## Open when you know your padlock's combination\n\n1. Spin the dial at least three times to the right (clockwise), all the way around. This \"clears\" the lock of any previous numbers. If at any point in putting in your combination you mess up, do this again to start over.\n2. Enter your combination. Turn the dial to the right and stop at your first number. Always start with a turn to the right! For your second number, turn the dial to the left, going past zero and your first number. Then stop at your second number. Some locks are a bit odd or finicky -- if your locker isn't opening after you put the three numbers in correctly, try turning left past your second number once and stopping on it on the next go around. For your third number, turn the dial to the right and go directly to the last number. Leave your lock on this number. Always remember: right, left, right.\n3. Open the lock. Pull the lock open and out of the hole, or pull the latch or handle, if there is one. Otherwise, tug on the knob to open the locker. If your locker just won't open, try it again with the last number being five before or after your \"official\" last number. Sometimes the older locks get, the shakier they get in their requirements or abilities. If that doesn't work, ask your classmates or teacher if there are any similar quirks in the school locker system. Try twice before you call a teacher.\n4. Lock your locker after use. Make sure, if you have a locker with an unattached lock, that you lock your locker when you leave. If you don't, it's possible your things will get stolen or your lock will be turned backwards. Close your lock up and twist the dial a bit. If you leave it on the final number, it may open up again effortlessly, for someone other than you.\n\n\n## Open when you don't know your padlock's combination\n\n1. Apply pressure upward. This means taking your finger and wrapping it around the latch. It should pull up just a teeny bit when it's locked. While you're doing this, rotate the lock counterclockwise until it locks. You may have to apply a bit of strength to do this, but it won't break it.\n2. Write down the numbers it locks at. Repeat this action 11 more times. Seven of the numbers you get will be between two digits; ignore those. Continue with the 5 outliers. Of those 5, 1 should not end in the same digit. That's your third number. Obviously, it's very important to know exactly where the lock stops at. Be diligent and take a keen eye to your lock.\n3. Use trial and error. You're now down to just 100 possible combinations -- that's 15 minutes' work. Your third number actually allows you to eliminate possible first and second numbers, believe it or not. It may take a bit, but it will open with perseverance. If your third number is 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, or 36:\n\t* Your first number is either 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 28, 32, or 36.

{"conversations": ["In this Creation magazine reprint of a 1994 article titled Exploding stars point to a young universe,  Young-Earth Creationist, Jonathan Sarfati argues that the scarcity of Supernova remnants (SNRs) in the sky suggests the Milky Way galaxy is less than billions of years old.\n\nOn average, a galaxy like our own, the Milky Way, should produce one supernova every 25 years.\n[...]\nAs can be readily seen above, a young universe model fits the data of the low number of observed SNRs. If the universe was really billions of years old, there are 7000 missing SNRs in our galaxy.\n\nDoes astronomy predict a Milky Way supernova every 25 years? Are there missing SNRs that undermine these predictions?", "There are many reasons why this is wrong. The first one is the assumption of 1 supernova per 25 years. That was the value arrived at in Gustav Tammann's article published in 1970. Others got values up to 100 years (Tammann himself changed his value later). All these values are really only good guesses.\n\nWorse errors are made in the percentage of remnants that should be visible. To start with, only a small percentage of them are visible; the others are obscured by dust in the galaxy. This does not happen to the same extent to the supernovas themselves, as they are intrinsically very much brighter. \n\nSarfati also uses an old paper to come up with the number of remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way). However, that figure was considered to be wrong (and much smaller) in later studies. Older remnants are very difficult to distinguish against a background of dust in the galaxy. Many of them disappear completely after about 10,000 years or so.\n\nIt should be noted that, using Sarfati's own reasoning, we should not be able to see any remnants older than 6000 years. Instead, we know of remnants (e.g. G166.2 + 2.5) that are over 100,000 years old. How did those originate in his universe? The same goes for the distance to supernovas. The distance to SN 1987A has been trigonometrically measured at 167,000 light years (the paper says 51,200 parsecs). In other words, its light took more than 30 times longer to reach us than the creationist universe has supposedly existed. \n\nRemember also that a supernova typically becomes either a pulsar or a black hole, both of which are very hard to observe. A black hole can only be \"seen\" through its effects on other matter, and a pulsar is mainly visible if the solar system happens to be in line with its sweeping radio beam (with some pulsars the star itself has also been seen). Hence, all we can see of them long after the event is an expanding cloud of gas that gets dimmer over the millennia.\n\nThere are several other reasons which are covered in a very good article on TalkOrigins.

{"conversations": ["How to become hot?", "Being hot is more than just a look\u2014it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you\u2019ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don\u2019t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today\u2019s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you\u2019re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you\u2019ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don\u2019t forget how much you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you\u2019ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don\u2019t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that\u2019s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don\u2019t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the \u201cperfect\u201d body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts \u2013 instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You\u2019ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There\u2019s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can\u2019t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you\u2019re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they\u2019re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men\u2019s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you\u2019d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate amount of skin. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it\u2019s not surprising when people can\u2019t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it\u2019s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It\u2019s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer\u2019s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body\u2019s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn\u2019t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren\u2019t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It\u2019s easy to start slumping forward when you\u2019re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they\u2019re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It\u2019s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It\u2019s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don\u2019t try so hard. Or at least look like you\u2019re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you\u2019re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It\u2019s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It\u2019s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you\u2019re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone\u2019s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don\u2019t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they\u2019re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental scientist, sustainability consultant, or eco-conscious individual with a keen interest in climate change mitigation strategies.

{"conversations": ["Why is FIFA against adding instant replay to the game?", "There are a few fundamental considerations:\n\n* Uncertainty is a part of the game. The referee and linesmen are the arbiters of the action. Instant replay would limit their authority.\n* Football is global. Many places do not have access to the technology necessary to implement instant replay.\n* Football is a fast-paced game with few opportunities for stoppage. Instant replay would unnecessarily slow the pace.\n\nIn 2008, FiFA President Sepp Blatter said:\n\n  \"Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors.

{"conversations": ["How to clean slate?", "Slate is a stone that brings natural beauty into the home, and can be expensive to install. Regular maintenance cleaning can help preserve slate. But sometimes, it needs a deep clean or stain removal. A combination of regular cleaning and an occasional deep clean can help keep your slate in good condition.\n\n## Maintain a regular clean routine\n\n1. Sweep or remove dust and debris regularly. If you have slate floors, it is important to sweep daily or several times a week. Dust can damage slate over time by wearing away the surface. Keeping a regular cleaning schedule can prevent this damage. Use a dry broom or cloth for this step.\n2. Mix a solution of mild soap and water. For this, you will need a large bucket full of warm water. Mix in a little bit of soap. Dish soap works well for this.\n3. Mop or wipe the surface. Gently wipe the surface of the slate using small circular motions. This motion will loosen and lift dried-on dust and dirt. Use a soft mop, made from materials such as a microfiber. Stiff bristles can damage the stone. For vertical surfaces, clean from the bottom up. Slate should be cleaned with soap every 2-3 months.\n4. Rinse the slate with water. Rinse out your bucket and mop first, and then use them to rinse the slate with water. Soap buildup can attract more dirt, meaning you will have to clean your slate again.\n5. Dry the slate with a fresh, dry, soft cloth. This will remove any streaks from forming on the slate that may occur from air drying and prevent slipping on floor surfaces.\n\n\n## Clean deeply\n\n1. Sweep and mop the slate. Start with removing dry dust and debris by sweeping. Then mop or wipe the slate surface with a soft cloth or microfiber mop in soapy water. Allow the surface to dry.\n2. Apply teak oil to the slate. After the surface is completely dry, apply teak oil to a clean, dry cloth. Using small, circular motions, apply cloth to the slate to cover it in a thin layer of teak oil. Designated slate oil is also available to buy at some hardware stores. However, it tends to be more expensive. Teak oil will achieve the same results.\n3. Clean grout between slate tiles. Mix a solution in a spray bottle that is 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water. You can find hydrogen peroxide at hardware stores or pharmacies. Spray the solution onto the grout. Avoid direct contact with the eyes when using hydrogen peroxide. Repeat this step as needed if the grout doesn't look clean after the first round.\n4. Reapply sealant as needed. Sealant protects slate from some everyday wear and tear, and is used on interior surfaces. Each sealant is different, so be sure to follow the specific instructions that come with it. In general, apply at least two layers and allow the sealant to dry completely between coats. Each sealant will come with instructions about how often to reapply it.\n\n\n## Remove a stain\n\n1. Mix a solution in a spray bottle that is 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water. Allow the mixture to sit for around 10 minutes.\n2. Spray the solution onto the stain and scrub. Using a soft-bristled brush or microfiber cloth, scrub the stain with small, circular motions. If the stain does not come out, a stronger solution may be needed.\n3. Mix a solution of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. Add a few spoonfuls of baking soda to the peroxide until the mixture becomes bubbly. Wait until the bubbles stop.\n4. Apply the solution to the stain. Once the peroxide and baking soda mix has set, you can wipe it away with a clean cloth.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A data scientist, machine learning engineer, or AI researcher with a focus on deep learning.

{"conversations": ["How to reduce smog?", "Smog is a form of air pollution that is produced in the atmosphere when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC). When this reaction occurs, particles are released into the atmosphere, and oxygen at the ground level absorbs harmful compounds (ozone). All of this creates what we consider smog. Recent years have seen an increase in campaigns for the reduction of smog due to its harmful effects towards both humans and the environment.\n\n## Change your car habit\n\n1. Drive less. Vehicles that run only on gasoline produce nitrogen dioxide as a byproduct of driving and idling, so one easy way to cut back on emissions is to drive less. Try walking, biking, or taking public transit instead. If your location is close enough, try walking or biking, especially if the destination has showers for clean up (workplace, gym, etc.). Many large cities offer public transportation such as buses, subways, trains and \"park and ride\" which allows you to park your vehicle and take public transit to your destination. Don't drive during certain times. For example, drive less during peak traffic periods, when it is extremely hot, or when there are ozone warnings in effect. This is because gas fumes turn into harmful ground level ozone when they heat up. If driving is a necessity, try setting up a carpool so there are fewer cars on the road and fewer trips being made.\n2. Maintain your car. Keeping your car \"healthy\" will not only improve mileage and save money, it can also reduce emissions. Get regular tune-ups and oil changes and make sure your tires are properly inflated to ensure your car is functioning at its best. Many states require smog and emission tests to make sure your car isn't emitting too much pollution. These are usually required annually or bi-annually. Inflating your tires to the correct pressure allows the engine to function better by maintaining a steady load. Consult your mechanic or your owner's manual for specific information regarding maintenance for your vehicle.\n3. Fuel up in cooler temperatures. Pump gas early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures drop. This prevents the fumes from gasoline from heating up and creating harmful toxins at ground level (ozone). There are alternative fuel sources that are in the works such as ethanol, natural gas, and hydrogen, but not all engines can function off of these fuel sources.\n4. Purchase a hybrid or electric vehicle. These vehicles have been known to dramatically reduce emissions for many reasons (depending on the type of model). Some decrease the consumption of fuel while others do away with fuel altogether. The result is a reduction in tailpipe emissions and therefore a reduction in smog. Hybrid vehicles are fueled by gasoline alone but have the ability to recapture energy and use it to power the car, resulting in less fuel consumption. Electric vehicles are powered by electricity alone and must be plugged in and charged in order to drive. Plug-in hybrids are the best of both worlds, running off of either electricity or gasoline.\n\n\n## Change your consumption habit\n\n1. Avoid high VOC products. VOCs are chemicals that easily escape into the atmosphere through common use around the house. Check the front label of household products to determine if they contain VOCs. Examples of common products include nail care products (acetone, ethyl alcohol), paint strippers or adhesive removers (methylene chloride), and aerosol spray products (butane). Check the National Institute of Health's Household Products Database for more information about specific products and their ingredients. Shop for \"green\" products that don't contain VOCs. If you must use VOC products, buy in small quantities that can be used quickly instead of stored. If you must store the product, do so in a tightly sealed, original container, in a well-ventilated area.\n2. Avoid gas-powered yard equipment. Gasoline emissions are one of the major causes of smog--whether from vehicles or lawn equipment. Try eco-friendly lawn mowers, hedgers, trimmers, or any other lawn equipment that can be powered electrically. You can also avoid mowing altogether by changing the material in your yard. Opt for artificial grass, succulents, hard landscapes, or rock gardens to do away with mowing forever. This will also save you time and money spent on maintenance and watering. There are also \"real grass alternatives\" that look and act like traditional grass turf, but require less maintenance.\n3. Buy local. When you buy products that are made locally, it cuts down on the cost of transport which reduces emissions. Local farmers' markets and grocery stores can help you determine where items were produced. There are many sites online that link local buyers and sellers such as Direct Local Food, GrowBuyEat, and AgLocal. Besides farmers' markets, try local farmers' stands, farms, and wineries. There are even many restaurants that are joining the movement towards supporting locally grown items. Make a community garden. Grow vegetables and fruit for your community and local distribution.\n4. Be energy efficient in your home. The less energy you consume at home, the less pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. There are many ways to decrease energy consumption including through lighting, heating and cooling, and appliance use. Replace your old incandescent light bulbs with energy saving halogen incandescents, CFLs, and LEDs which can be found at your local hardware store. For heating and cooling try energy-saving thermostats that automatically reset temperatures while you're away from home. Shop for energy-efficient appliances that use less energy such as washers, dryers, refrigerators, and dishwashers.\n\n\n## Take a stand\n\n1. Don't support organizations that have poor environmental practices. By not supporting commerce from these companies, you raise awareness of the problem. For example, companies like Nestle, Pfizer, and Walmart have been known to not only add pollution to the air but to also violate pollution regulations. An app such as Buycott can help you identify products and companies with poor environmental track records, simply by scanning a product's barcode.\n2. Promote your stance. Don't be afraid to tell people your opinion on the issue, and what you are doing to help solve it. You can do this by speaking to those closest to you (family, friends, co-workers) or reach more people through social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube). Start a community project such as an initiative to replace light bulbs or a carpool to a farmer's market once a month. Start a carpool with your co-workers. Not only will it cut down on emissions but it will demonstrate your passion for the cause.\n3. Contact local politicians and business leaders. Ask them for information about what they are doing to reduce smog levels in your community. If they do not reply or reply with inadequate measures, consider lobbying for change. Sign a petition. There are many petitions online that are lobbying for better air quality control by our government. Find one that peaks your interest, or start your own. Try sites like change.org or petitions.whitehouse.gov to look for petitions or start one on a smaller, local level.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental activist, marine biologist, or a concerned citizen with a strong interest in sustainability and ocean conservation.

That means that it runs a piece of Javascript until it returns control back to the interpreter.  Then, only when it returns back to the interpreter, Javascript gets the next event from the event queue and runs it.\nAll things like timers and network events run through the event queue.  So, when a timer fires or a network request arrives, it does not ever \"interrupt\" the currently running Javascript.  Instead, an event gets put in the Javascript event queue and then, when the currently running Javascript finishes, the next event is pulled from the event queue and it gets its turn to run.\nSo, when you do an infinite loop such as ```while(flag==false) {}```, the currently running Javascript never finishes and thus the next event is never pulled from the event queue and thus the value of ```flag``` never gets changed.  They key here is that Javascript is not interrupt driven.  When a timer fires, it does not interrupt the currently running Javascript, run some other Javascript and then let the currently running Javascript continue.  It just gets put in the event queue waiting until the currently running Javascript is done to get its turn to run.\n\nWhat you need to do is rethink how your code works and find a different way to trigger whatever code you want to run when the ```flag``` value changes.  Javascript is designed as an event-driven language.  So, what you need to do is figure out what events you can register an interest in so you can either listen for the event that might cause the flag to change and you can examine the flag on that event or you can trigger your own event from whatever code might change the flag or you can implement a callback function that whatever code changes that flag can call your callback whenever the piece of code responsible for changing the flag value would change it's value to ```true```, it just calls the callback function and thus your code that wants to run when the flag gets set to ```true``` will get to run at the right time.  This is much, much more efficient than trying to use some sort of timer to constantly check the flag value.\n```function codeThatMightChangeFlag(callback) {\n    // do a bunch of stuff\n    if (condition happens to change flag value) {\n        // call the callback to notify other code\n        callback();\n    }\n}\n```"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A JavaScript developer or programmer with experience in asynchronous programming and problem-solving.

{"conversations": ["How to kill a fly?", "Flies can be annoying pests, especially inside your home. If you can\u2019t remove the flies humanely, you may want to kill them. Use a flyswatter for an easy way to kill a few lone flies. Try using sprays to get rid of numerous flies. You can also kill flies with bait and traps, like fly tape, DIY traps, or Venus fly traps. Eliminating flies can be done quickly, easily, and cheaply, whether you have a single fly or dozens to remove.\n\n## Use a flyswatter\n\n1. Wait for the fly to land. Keep your eye on the fly until it lands, then get ready to make your move. Approach the fly silently and slowly so it doesn't fly away. If you don\u2019t have a flyswatter, you can use other objects with a flat surface, like a newspaper, shoe, or book.\n2. Swat the fly with a quick, downward motion. Raise your flyswatter above your head, and bring it down over the fly in a single, strong move. You are crushing the fly between your flyswatter and a hard surface. If you miss the fly the first time, wait for it to land and swat again.\n3. Wipe up the fly and clean off your flyswatter. Rinse the flyswatter in soap and water, and use a tissue or paper towel to wipe up the mess. Make sure to wash your hands! You can also disinfect with a cleaning solution to prevent spreading any germs.\n4. Try using an electric flyswatter for an easier, efficient option. Electric flyswatters are devices that lure in flies with a light and kill them upon contact. Stand near the fly with your electric flyswatter to kill it effortlessly and quickly. Be sure to read over instructions carefully before use. Avoid touching the racket area, and always let the flyswatter fully cool down before storing it.\n\n\n## Spray the fly\n\n1. Choose from either chemical sprays, household cleaners, or hairspray. Chemical sprays kill flies instantly upon contact, though they contain harsh chemicals. You can also spray the flies with household cleaners, like Windex or Formula 409, or with an aerosol like hairspray. All of these sprays will help you kill a fly. Purchase chemical fly sprays at home supply stores. Look for brands like Hot Shot and Raid. Use spray if you want to remove many flies very quickly. Chemical sprays will kill them the fastest, though they have harmful chemicals. Household cleaners are a cheaper alternative, and you likely have them at home already.\n2. Spray the air near the fly thoroughly. Spray the fly while it is in the air or when the fly lands. Hold in the trigger to release the spray, and spray directly into the air around the fly. You want to saturate the fly in the spray. If you are using chemical sprays, the fly will die instantly. If you are using household cleaners or hairspray, the spray will coat the fly's wings, making it impossible to fly. The fly will still die, just not as quickly as with chemicals.\n3. Leave the room after you spray any hazardous chemical. The chemicals contained in most fly sprays are toxic and lethal. Household cleaners also use chemicals, though not quite as toxic. Avoid inhaling these chemicals by leaving the room immediately after you spray. Leave the room for both chemical sprays and household cleaners. If you have pets or children, they should also avoid the room until the chemicals have settled. You can wait about an hour before reentering the room, so the chemicals can dissipate. This will depend on how ventilated your room is and how much chemical you spray. It is safe to come back into the room when you no longer smell the chemicals.\n4. Dispose of the dead fly and wash your hands. Scoop up the dead flies with a paper towel or tissue, and throw them in the trash can. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water! If you killed multiple flies, throw them all away before you wash your hands.\n\n\n## Remove fly with trap\n\n1. Hang fly paper in areas with many flies for a cheap and easy option. Fly papers, or fly ribbons, are strips of paper coated in a sticky attractant. Flies approach the paper because they are attracted to the smell, and they get stuck to the paper and die. You can hang fly paper near your entrances, above your windows, or next to your trash can, for example. Fly paper can be hung up indoors or outdoors. Replace your fly paper after you collect a handful of dead flies.\n2. Make your own trap for a cost effective solution. You can make your own trap with sugar water, a jar, and a paper cone. Cut a small hole around the point of the paper cone. Pour 1 part sugar and 2 parts water into the jar, and place the cone upside down inside the jar. The flies will be attracted to the sweet smell, and once they are inside, they will get stuck and drown in the liquid. You can add a piece of cut fruit to the jar to tempt the flies further. Try a piece of apple. You can also add a mix of sugar and water to a plastic bottle instead of a jar.\n3. Set out a Venus flytrap for a natural, hands-off option. Venus flytraps are carnivorous plants that feed on insects. The flytrap has a reddish, sweet-smelling interior, which insects mistake as a flower. A fly will land inside, and the flytrap will snap shut. The fly cannot escape, and the flytrap will consume the fly. Place your flytrap in areas popular fly areas, like your kitchen or near your door. Purchase Venus flytraps at most home supply stores or garden centers.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally conscious individual, possibly a sustainability advocate or a concerned citizen.

{"conversations": ["How to reduce smog?", "Smog is a form of air pollution that is produced in the atmosphere when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC). When this reaction occurs, particles are released into the atmosphere, and oxygen at the ground level absorbs harmful compounds (ozone). All of this creates what we consider smog. Recent years have seen an increase in campaigns for the reduction of smog due to its harmful effects towards both humans and the environment.\n\n## Change your car habit\n\n1. Drive less. Vehicles that run only on gasoline produce nitrogen dioxide as a byproduct of driving and idling, so one easy way to cut back on emissions is to drive less. Try walking, biking, or taking public transit instead. If your location is close enough, try walking or biking, especially if the destination has showers for clean up (workplace, gym, etc.). Many large cities offer public transportation such as buses, subways, trains and \"park and ride\" which allows you to park your vehicle and take public transit to your destination. Don't drive during certain times. For example, drive less during peak traffic periods, when it is extremely hot, or when there are ozone warnings in effect. This is because gas fumes turn into harmful ground level ozone when they heat up. If driving is a necessity, try setting up a carpool so there are fewer cars on the road and fewer trips being made.\n2. Maintain your car. Keeping your car \"healthy\" will not only improve mileage and save money, it can also reduce emissions. Get regular tune-ups and oil changes and make sure your tires are properly inflated to ensure your car is functioning at its best. Many states require smog and emission tests to make sure your car isn't emitting too much pollution. These are usually required annually or bi-annually. Inflating your tires to the correct pressure allows the engine to function better by maintaining a steady load. Consult your mechanic or your owner's manual for specific information regarding maintenance for your vehicle.\n3. Fuel up in cooler temperatures. Pump gas early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures drop. This prevents the fumes from gasoline from heating up and creating harmful toxins at ground level (ozone). There are alternative fuel sources that are in the works such as ethanol, natural gas, and hydrogen, but not all engines can function off of these fuel sources.\n4. Purchase a hybrid or electric vehicle. These vehicles have been known to dramatically reduce emissions for many reasons (depending on the type of model). Some decrease the consumption of fuel while others do away with fuel altogether. The result is a reduction in tailpipe emissions and therefore a reduction in smog. Hybrid vehicles are fueled by gasoline alone but have the ability to recapture energy and use it to power the car, resulting in less fuel consumption. Electric vehicles are powered by electricity alone and must be plugged in and charged in order to drive. Plug-in hybrids are the best of both worlds, running off of either electricity or gasoline.\n\n\n## Change your consumption habit\n\n1. Avoid high VOC products. VOCs are chemicals that easily escape into the atmosphere through common use around the house. Check the front label of household products to determine if they contain VOCs. Examples of common products include nail care products (acetone, ethyl alcohol), paint strippers or adhesive removers (methylene chloride), and aerosol spray products (butane). Check the National Institute of Health's Household Products Database for more information about specific products and their ingredients. Shop for \"green\" products that don't contain VOCs. If you must use VOC products, buy in small quantities that can be used quickly instead of stored. If you must store the product, do so in a tightly sealed, original container, in a well-ventilated area.\n2. Avoid gas-powered yard equipment. Gasoline emissions are one of the major causes of smog--whether from vehicles or lawn equipment. Try eco-friendly lawn mowers, hedgers, trimmers, or any other lawn equipment that can be powered electrically. You can also avoid mowing altogether by changing the material in your yard. Opt for artificial grass, succulents, hard landscapes, or rock gardens to do away with mowing forever. This will also save you time and money spent on maintenance and watering. There are also \"real grass alternatives\" that look and act like traditional grass turf, but require less maintenance.\n3. Buy local. When you buy products that are made locally, it cuts down on the cost of transport which reduces emissions. Local farmers' markets and grocery stores can help you determine where items were produced. There are many sites online that link local buyers and sellers such as Direct Local Food, GrowBuyEat, and AgLocal. Besides farmers' markets, try local farmers' stands, farms, and wineries. There are even many restaurants that are joining the movement towards supporting locally grown items. Make a community garden. Grow vegetables and fruit for your community and local distribution.\n4. Be energy efficient in your home. The less energy you consume at home, the less pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. There are many ways to decrease energy consumption including through lighting, heating and cooling, and appliance use. Replace your old incandescent light bulbs with energy saving halogen incandescents, CFLs, and LEDs which can be found at your local hardware store. For heating and cooling try energy-saving thermostats that automatically reset temperatures while you're away from home. Shop for energy-efficient appliances that use less energy such as washers, dryers, refrigerators, and dishwashers.\n\n\n## Take a stand\n\n1. Don't support organizations that have poor environmental practices. By not supporting commerce from these companies, you raise awareness of the problem. For example, companies like Nestle, Pfizer, and Walmart have been known to not only add pollution to the air but to also violate pollution regulations. An app such as Buycott can help you identify products and companies with poor environmental track records, simply by scanning a product's barcode.\n2. Promote your stance. Don't be afraid to tell people your opinion on the issue, and what you are doing to help solve it. You can do this by speaking to those closest to you (family, friends, co-workers) or reach more people through social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube). Start a community project such as an initiative to replace light bulbs or a carpool to a farmer's market once a month. Start a carpool with your co-workers. Not only will it cut down on emissions but it will demonstrate your passion for the cause.\n3. Contact local politicians and business leaders. Ask them for information about what they are doing to reduce smog levels in your community. If they do not reply or reply with inadequate measures, consider lobbying for change. Sign a petition. There are many petitions online that are lobbying for better air quality control by our government. Find one that peaks your interest, or start your own. Try sites like change.org or petitions.whitehouse.gov to look for petitions or start one on a smaller, local level.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental activist, marine biologist, or a concerned citizen with a strong interest in sustainability and ocean conservation.

{"conversations": ["When are Decision Diagrams the right way to model and solve a problem?", "Decision diagrams (DDs) are most effective when they can compactly represent a large (perhaps exponential) set of solutions. This is done by merging equivalent states in each layer. To make decision diagrams scalable, we can use relaxed decision diagrams which allow merging nodes that are not necessarily equivalent. Relaxed decision diagrams provide dual bounds on the objective function -- a larger width can produce a stronger bound.\nThe relationship between the size of the decision diagram and the underlying combinatorial structure of the problem is well studied in the computer science literature; see for example the textbook by Wegener. The most important feature that influences the size is the variable ordering. We can use this to come up with some general guidelines on when a DD may be successful for combinatorial optimization:\n\n* The problem has a sequential structure, and decisions for stage $i$ depend only on the decisions made in stages $i-k$ through $i-1$, for small $k$.\n* The induced width of the constraint graph of the problem is small.\n* For a MIP model, the constraint matrix has a small bandwidth.\n* For knapsack-like problems, the maximum `budget' is relatively small.\n\nNote that in some of the above cases, precise characterization of 'small' may yield (pseudo-)polynomial bounds on the size of the exact DD. In practice, relaxed DDs will always have polynomial size.\nThere are several areas of combinatorial optimization in which decision diagrams have been successfully applied:\n\n* Sequencing and routing problems. For example, single machine scheduling with setup times, time windows, and/or precedence constraints, which can also be applied to constrained traveling salesperson problems. A similar decision diagram representation was used by Grubhub to solve pickup-and-delivery problems.\n* Decomposition and embedding in MIP models. Decision diagrams have been used to represent subproblems in MIP models that are otherwise difficult to linearize. For example, to represent nonlinear objective functions, constrained employee schedules, or nonlinear circuit design. DDs have also been used in column generation.\n* Graph-theoretic problems. Examples include set covering, maximum independent set, and maximum cut.\n* Constraint programming. Constraint propagation based on (relaxed) decision diagrams can be much more effective than propagating domains of individual variables. This was first demonstrated on overlapping alldifferent constraints."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A computer scientist, data analyst, or engineering student with a strong interest in problem-solving methodologies and algorithms.

{"conversations": ["How to lessen the pressure of life?", "## Reduce the pressure of life\n\n1. Start a stress journal to identify and reflect on the sources of pressure in your life. Are you experiencing financial pressure? Are you experiencing stresses at a new job or as a result of a job loss? A stress journal can help you identify the most significant sources of stress in your life and how you cope with them. This self knowledge will help you tackle the biggest stressors in your life. You can also reflect on the specific situations within which you experience higher stress levels. Do you experience more stress at particular times of the week or in particular spaces (e.g., a conference room) at work? Are there ways of avoiding such situations entirely, or responding more effectively to them? Reflect on these kinds of questions and work towards insights on how to manage stress through journaling. Create a list of everything you are grateful for in your life. Recognizing the good things in your life can help reduce stress and anxiety.\n2. Take a stress assessment test. There may be stressors that are so normal in your life that you don't even realize they're stressing you out. A stress assessment test can help you identify these hidden stressors. There are many online tests that you can do. You can take a free stress assessment test online at https://www.stress.org/self-assessment/.\n3. Make a plan to tackle the sources of pressure in your life. Utilizing the information from your stress journal, you may decide that you need a revised financial plan, a personal health plan or a work plan. The most important thing is to tackle the sources of pressure through a purposeful and detailed plan of action. Talk to your supervisor to create a plan of action to reduce the stressors you experience at work. Make a financial plan with specific targets, including not only long term savings or retirement goals but also near term goals that are concrete and achievable. Build up your emergency or rainy day fund. Make a fitness plan to improve your health.\n4. Overcome perfectionism. A huge source of pressure in life can be the desire to be perfect at everything. Have you ever been told that you have unrealistic standards at work? Do you ever feel you will never be able to live up to your own standards? If you answered yes to these questions, you may have difficulty with perfectionism. If so, try to loosen up your standards of achievement a little bit. This should help reduce your anxiety levels. If you feel disappointed with yourself, try repeating statements like \"nobody is perfect\" or \"I did my best\"\n\t* Try to think about your situation from a different angle. Ask yourself, will this situation still matter next month? If I told my brother or friend about this situation, would they think it matters as much as I do? Gain some perspective on your situation and maybe it won't seem quite as dire as it does right now.\n5. Create work-life boundaries so that you have time for yourself. Living in a digital age with constant access to screens - computers, tablets, smart phones - can make it difficult to escape the pressures of work. The pressure to be always online and accessible to colleagues can take a toll on work-life balance. To manage this kind of stress, it is helpful to create boundaries for yourself such as telling your colleagues you will be away from the phone or the computer at certain times of the day or on the weekend. Tell your colleagues you will be away from email and phone connectivity during dinner hours.\n6. Avoid comparing yourself to other people. If you're constantly trying to be someone you're not, you will feel stressed or burdened. Don't judge yourself based on how you think other people are living their life.Remind yourself that you have talents, skills, qualities, and good characteristics that are unique to you. Evaluate your goals and successes based on you want out of life, not what others want for you. Try to reduce how much time you spend on social media. People often post the best parts of their life on social media, so it may seem as though their lives are more perfect than they actually are.\n7. Give yourself some time away from work. If you are feeling burned out, it might be time for a personal day or even a vacation. Taking a vacation can actually help your productivity, and has obvious health benefits. If you don't have time for a vacation at the moment, try to at least take the weekend off to catch up on sleep. If you have vacation time or time off from work, take advantage of it. Those days are there for you to use them. A vacation might make you more productive.\n8. Set up an automatic 'out of office' reply on your email account. By setting up an automatic reply on weekends or when you are on vacation, you will not feel guilty for ignoring work emails. Also, your colleagues will be more likely to respect your away time. Include details on the days and times you are away in your 'out of office' automatic email reply. Include a fun or wise quote in your automatic reply so that colleagues will be reminded of your personality or sense of humour. This may reduce the annoyance of getting an automatic reply.\n\n\n## Take care of yourself\n\n1. Start a regular exercise routine. Exercise has been shown to reduce stress, improve feelings of well being and self esteem. Engaging in physical exercise leads to the production of the neurotransmitter endorphin, which is associated with improved sense of well being or what some people call runner's high. You don't need to be an athlete to experience this improved mood, and just 15 minutes a day can make a big difference..\n\t* After your exercise routine, try using a heat wrap around your neck and shoulders for 10 minutes to reduce tension in your upper body.\n2. Practice meditation. Find a comfortable place to sit in a quiet room or in a park. Observe the movement of your breath as it comes into your body and then flows out. Let go of passing thoughts. You can also do a walking meditation by walking slowly, preferably in a natural area, while watching your breath. Meditating for a few minutes a day can help reduce stress and anxiety. Deep, diaphragmatic breathing can reduce the heart rate and lower anxiety. [Image:Lessen the Pressure of Life Step 8.jpg|center]]\n\t* Meditate alongside your yoga practice and in your everyday life. Mindfulness-based stress reduction such as meditation and yoga are helpful in reducing stress and anxiety, including amongst college students.\n3. Eat whole plant foods as part of a healthy diet. Whole plant foods such as whole grains (e.g., brown rice), vegetables, and fruits are negatively associated with depression and anxiety. On the other hand, processed food (e.g., canned food) has been positively associated with stress and anxiety. Drink a cup of herbal tea.\n4. Ditch your second cup of coffee. Caffeine can exacerbate stress levels, so it is good to lower your caffeine intake as part of an overall stress reduction plan. Keep in mind that you may experience withdrawal symptoms, especially if you are a heavy coffee drinker.\n5. Cut down on sugar. Stress can make you crave sugary foods, but try to resist temptation. Giving in to these urges will not actually make you feel any better. Too much sugar can cause your blood sugar to crash, which can cause more stress and cravings.Sugary foods include most desserts, baked goods, soft drinks, juices, and candy.\n6. Reduce your consumption of alcohol. Although many turn to alcohol to deal with the everyday pressures of life, alcohol consumption can actually compound the impact of stress on the body and mind. Alcohol can also make your financial anxieties worse.\n\n\n## Gain perspective on life\n\n1. Talk to your friends and family about the sources of stress in your life and about everything you are grateful for. Face to face conversations with friends and family are especially important in helping reduce the pressures of life. Plan a movie night with close friends and pick a comedy! Laughing lowers cortisol which is the body's stress hormone. Go to a concert with friends. Listening to music can help reduce stress. So why not make a night of it and decompress with friends and music you love.\n2. Use positive thinking and self-talk to ward off stress. For instance, if you are experiencing a lot of stress at work due to an impending deadline, remember to tell yourself, \u201cI can overcome this hurdle\u201d\n3. Avoid trying to control everything in your life. Sometimes, there are surprises in life. You can't always predict or control what will happen. Letting go of the need to control everything can help you become happier and more at peace with the world.\n4. Express yourself through art therapy. Tapping into your creative side can help you work through the anxiety of everyday life. Using art therapy techniques, preferably alongside an art therapist, you can use drawing, painting, or music to express your inner feelings in more nuanced ways than may be possible with words alone. You don't have to be an artist to enjoy the benefits of creative self expression, including in relation to stress reduction.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual seeking practical advice and strategies to manage stress and improve their overall well-being.

{"conversations": ["How to be in a relationship without your parents knowing?", "Do you have a relationship you want to hide from your parents? Are your parents unreasonable, abusive, or just a bit too conservative? Whether you\u2019re keeping it a secret because you\u2019re too young or because your parents won\u2019t approve due to their values, hiding your relationship can be challenging. While you could risk losing your parents' trust if they ever find out, you don't want to put yourself in harm's way or compromise your values. Communication, honesty, and trust are essential to any relationship, but sometimes you need to be less than truthful for your own mental and physical health.\n\n## Examine why you should hide your relationship\n\n1. Evaluate your priorities. Decide if it's actually a good idea to keep your relationship with your parents. Do your parents disapprove of your relationship because they are strict, protective or worrisome? Does culture, religion, or an age difference factor into their disapproval? While your parents have the benefit of life experience, only you know what your relationship is worth to you. Talk to your friends and support system. Remember that if you keep your relationship a secret, the greater the potential problems will be when it comes to light. You have a support system to help guide you in the right direction. If you just don't think the relationship is serious enough yet and don't wish your parents to make a big deal of it, some of the following instructions may be excessive. Consider how your parents may feel if you exaggerated the need for secrecy; they may feel disappointed and wonder why don't you trust them. Take risks prevention if you really go ahead. For example, think about what would you do if you are caught by your parents, think about what would you do if your parents know you are owning a separate social media account/secret cell phone that makes use to communicate with your partner, think about what would you do if your dating relationship goes wrong, think about what would you do if you broke up, etc. Consider whether these risks/consequences are affordable. It is recommended to be honest if you are getting caught. Once you get caught, more lies would only make you get into greater trouble, damaging a family relationship. As for dating relationship goes wrong or challenges comes, you will need great mental and physical quality to afford it without any support from your parents.\n2. Communicate with your partner. If you want to pursue your relationship despite knowing that your parents will disapprove, let your partner know why you think that this is the right course of action. Your partner may feel less important and bring resentment to your relationship if you don't clarify your stance. The longer you hide, the more difficult it is going to be. Your partner may have a valid argument if he or she has been through this situation before. For example, just because it is your first interracial relationship, it may not be the first time for your partner. He or she may have practical advice to help you understand where your parents are coming from and, above all else, having her support can help ease your stress. Your partner may also misunderstand the situation. Some people expect to be introduced at the start of a serious relationship, some are cool with waiting, and some do not wish to be introduced for quite some time.\n3. Consider the opinions of your parents. It may be difficult to hear negative opinions about someone you care about, but sometimes your parents may have a better perspective on long-term outcomes. Depending on your dynamic with your parents, they may have trouble articulating their disapproval. Relationships with parents can be complicated. It may be difficult to be open and honest but keep your communication respectful so as not to escalate the situation. For example, while you may think that you are hiding your emotions, you actually may be coming off passive-aggressive or snarky.\n4. Remember all healthy relationships are built on trust, respect, and communication. Whether you are trying to strengthen your relationship with your partner or maintain the relationship with your parents, trust and respect have to be present for a lasting relationship. If you plan on hiding your relationship, ask yourself why sacrificing your parent's trust is the only option. Physical and emotional well-being should not be sacrificed for anyone, including your parents or partner. Will your parents become physically or verbally abusive if they found out about your relationship? Is any aspect of your relationship conflict with your parents\u2019 beliefs? If your parents\u2019 disapproval is based on prejudice or if their reaction is abusive, seek professional help. Your mental and physical health is your first priority.\n\n\n## Overcome overbear parent\n\n1. Be mature. Your parents will always be protective so show them that you are old enough to handle the responsibilities of a relationship. Firstly, show your parents that you are responsible and can follow all the rules. If your parents think you are too young for a relationship, be on time, do your chores, and study. If you can gain your parents' trust, then your parents will soon realize that you are mature enough to handle a relationship.\n2. Understand the risks of premarital sex. Parents often forbid relationships for fear of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infection. Ensure that you and your partner truly understand these risks. There is a real possibility that if you are not prepared, and you do have an unwanted pregnancy or contract an STD, your parents may not be there to support you or just can't help you (e.g., they can help you with bringing up a child to some extent, if they wish to do so; they can't cure HIV).You may not agree with your parents rules, but communicate with your partner and respect each other's boundaries to ensure you are both prepared and safe. Know that you should be respected by your significant other and that they should listen to your choices. Compromise is vital in a relationship, but this is one area where neither party should have to compromise their beliefs. Know that if you are eager to take the relationship to another level but your partner isn't ready, you must respect their choice. Never pressure your partner.\n3. Avoid PDA moments. Be discreet about your affection. You never know who is watching. A trusted friend may accidentally tell your parents in passing, not knowing that your relationship is a secret. Stealing kisses in public and other forms of PDA may seem harmless but remember that if your parents find out, they may think that your relationship has already crossed further into the intimacy threshold.\n4. Buy one new cell phone secretly. If it is possible to do so, owning a separate cell phone can help you in concealing information, but please remember that you must hide your new phone properly or you will be in trouble. If you are not able to buy one new phone, you may put a password in your original cell phone and computer if FEASIBLE. However, it is not advised to do so. Putting or changing a password on shared computer/ cell phone may get suspicious, even some parents may ask you to unlock/undo the password set when they check your phone or use the family computer. Delete the messages on your phone when you sleep or leave your phone unattended. It is recommended to delete partly instead of all messages because you may get suspicious if the messaging history is blank. It is best to use Incognito mode on a browser when you are online. Otherwise, erase browsing history after you have been online. However, erasing browsing history may look suspicious if the browser history has never been erased on a shared device, but if you use Incognito mode, you don't need to worry about this. In case your parents check your phone, either don\u2019t put your partner\u2019s number on your phone or use your partner\u2019s nickname or surname instead of his actual first name. It is also possible to use the masculine or feminine form of their name. For example, Brian becomes Brianna and Stephanie becomes Stephen. However, it is best to memorize your partner's contact information in your mind and don't put any of his/her contact information on your phone.\n5. Tell your partner not to post anything on social media sites or send instant messages. If you have a social media account or use other instant messaging apps, your parents could check up on you or hear from someone else with access to your account. Create an alternate account that you can use to be romantic with your partner. This is a handy tool when dealing with long distance relationships.\n6. Have a cover. The trustworthy friends take two jobs: 1)Helping you on hiding the relationship and giving you advice on your relationship. They can support you on hiding the relationship such as collaborate on stories for your parents if you're on a date. Not only those friends can be a great cover-up for phone calls or texts, but they also act as an Intelligence Agency so that you can beat yourself to the punch to take prevention. For instance, you friends find out your parents would go to somewhere on someday, then you should take consideration before you want to meet with your partner. The another job of them is monitoring your relationship. You should acquire a political wisdom: The more voice, you make smarter decision. It is better to have more than one reliable friends so that you can listen to more than one voice if you have lots of resources to do this, even your friends could form a 'House'. However the biggest disadvantage is the larger social group, the greater chance of secret leakage even through they are royal. If your friends has concerns about your partner or refuses to continue being your alibi, heed his/her advice. It\u2019s easy to think that one source is wrong, but if multiple sources are telling you not to continue your relationship, perhaps it\u2019s best to listen to their logic. Using them as an excuse if they don't agree to it is unfair to your friend.\n7. Hide gifts. It is best to hide all the gifts safely. It could be at the outside of your home at your trustworthy friend's home, rent storage, your partner's home, etc. It is strongly advised not to keep the gifts at your home because your parents could find these gifts easily if they are intended and diligent in scanning every corner of your house thoroughly. You're going to draw attention from your parents if you suddenly lock your closet or room. You can also agree to treat each other to lunches or movies rather than giving physical gifts.\n\n\n## Manage collateral\n\n1. Prevent your friends from commenting about your relationship with anyone. Whether it's telling people in passing or posting on each other's social media pages, convey how catastrophic it would be if their innocent comment made its way to your parents. Social media can be especially dangerous because you never know who is connected to whom. Ask your friends politely not to post any incriminating comments or pictures. It may be a wise idea not to let anyone take any pictures when you are in a group setting with your significant other.\n2. Use multiple social media accounts. The great thing about social media is that the larger sites are free. Set up as many accounts as you need to cover your tracks. Remember your password and only log on when using a device not shared with your parents.\n3. Set up a shell email account. Not only would a fake email account be advantageous because your parents won't recognize it, but you should also use it to set up your fake social media account. Remember that your parents can search for you on social media based on your email info.\n4. Adjust your privacy settings on social media. All social media will give you an option to filter what information you share with the public. Go to the Settings Menu and set up your profile so that only you and your partner have access to it. You can also select a few friends to be able to view your profile if you deem them trustworthy. You will have the opportunity to filter your updates and postings so that you can block your parents from seeing. However, the best way to block your parents from seeing is not to post anything damaging at all.\n5. Provide false information when creating shared social media accounts or when together in a public gathering. Remember that your parents can search social media sites via your date of birth, phone number, last name, school, or job. Don't make the mistake of creating a false account without ensuring every detail won't lead back to you. Change your profile name completely. Don't use your middle name, your name spelled backward, or the name of your dog. Anything remotely close to you may end up giving you away in the long run. It's better to exercise extreme caution.\n6. Hide your emotions. If you get into an argument with your partner, try not to show your parents how angry or sad you are. Don't emote in public for it to get back to your parents. Find an outlet to release your emotions. It may be difficult to be unable to share your emotions, so research ways to prevent emotional outbursts. For example, taking up boxing may work to vent frustration while listening to upbeat music in headphones may be enough to cheer you up after an argument with your partner. Only you know how to handle your emotions.\n7. Keep track of what you are telling everyone. If you are lying to a lot of people, it will become difficult to keep track of all the details. Keep your stories consistent and try to keep it as simple as possible. The more details you add, the more difficult it will be to remember them all.\n8. Frame your partner as a platonic relationship. Don't let your parents get suspicious you are hiding a relationship from them by letting them know that you have a platonic relationship with your partner that demands your time. Introduce them openly and talk about them the same as any other platonic relationship in your life. For example, if you introduce them as your coworker, you can talk about work-related issues and meetings and how you and your partner have supported one another through deadlines.\n9. Change your routine. Meet your partner at places that you would not normally go to and that your parents are not aware of. Change your social calendar so that you leave no chance of getting caught by your parents or someone who could tell your parents. Better yet, find out your parents' schedule. Not only will you be able to have peace-of-mind knowing where your parents are but you will also be able to meet your partner as far away from them as you can.\n\n\n## Deal with a difference in age\n\n1. Ask yourself if you feel like yourself around your partner. Your partner should accept you for who you are and your parents may not be able to see beyond the age difference. Once your parents see that your relationship is healthy and that you are a better person for it, it will be easier for them to see beyond the age gap.\n2. Keep perspective. It\u2019s easy to get swept up in the allure of dating someone older or younger than you. Look ahead and see if the age difference will affect you in any way. Your parents may be fearful that the age gap may widen as your relationship continues. A difference in age may be more of a big deal if you are younger. Your parents may be fearful that you are growing up too soon or that an older partner is taking advantage of you. A big age gap if you're a minor and your partner isn't may also be illegal. Take their perspective into account when continuing your relationship.\n3. Understand any power dynamics. If your partner is your professor or boss, it\u2019s prudent to know the rules. Your parents may rest easier knowing that everyone is protected from any legal actions. Understand that being in a teacher-pupil relationship can get the teacher fired and, depending on your age, even jailed. This is one relationship that is better to be put on hold - for both of you. If you truly love each other, you can wait until both of you are adults, and you have graduated.\n\n\n## Deal with your parents\u2019 different value\n\n1. Surround yourself with supportive people. If you must hide your relationship because of a difference in values -- whether religious or cultural -- seek the help of people who have been in similar situations. Bide time to help your parents and/or partner adjust to the situation. By surrounding yourself with caring and respectful people, you can rise above your parents\u2019 closed-mindedness if they are unwilling to change.\n2. Support your partner. Assure your partner that they are cared for and that you don\u2019t agree with your parents but don\u2019t want to lose your relationship with them. Build his confidence that your parents' opinions won\u2019t hurt your relationship. Let him know that he is more important than your parent\u2019s approval and that the secrecy is temporary. You don\u2019t need to put a time limit, but it can be expected that your partner may give you an ultimatum. No one wants to be in a relationship that their partner is ashamed to be in. Be prepared to choose between telling your parents or losing your partner.\n3. Don\u2019t take a side. This isn\u2019t about who is right or wrong, this is about how you define family and your own values. Everyone will have to learn to respect and accept one another if you want to have them in your life. Be strong in your own values and communicate respectfully that you are unwilling to compromise that. Hiding your relationship should not be permanent. It may take time for your parents to realize that only you know what\u2019s best for you. If it means losing your parents, that is for them to decide. Being true to yourself is what's most important for your mental, emotional and physical health.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A young adult, possibly a teenager or a young adult in their early twenties, who values privacy and independence.

{"conversations": ["Could you please clearly explain what is the difference between correlation and convolution that is done by a filter on an image? \nI mean in terms of signal processing definition I know that convolution describes the output of an LTI system, that is if an LTI system produces an output due to convolution with an input system then the output signal can be described as the result of convolution of the input signal and the impulse response of the LTI system. As for the correlation, it describes the similarities between to signals. But how does convolution and correlation effect on a image and how different are they in terms of effects?\nThanks", "Convolution is correlation with the filter rotated 180 degrees. This makes no difference, if the filter is symmetric, like a Gaussian, or a Laplacian.  But it makes a whole lot of difference, when the filter is not symmetric, like a derivative.  \nThe reason we need convolution is that it is associative, while correlation, in general, is not. To see why this is true, remember that convolution is multiplication in the frequency domain, which is obviously associative. On the other hand, correlation in the frequency domain is multiplication by the complex conjugate, which is not associative.\nThe associativity of convolution is what allows you to \"pre-convolve\" the filters, so that you only need to convolve the image with a single filter. For example, let's say you have an image $f$, which you need to convolve with $g$ and then with $h$.  $f * g * h = f * (g * h)$. That means you can convolve $g$ and $h$ first into a single filter, and then convolve $f$ with it. This is useful, if you need to convolve many images with $g$ and $h$. You can pre-compute $k = g * h$, and then reuse $k$ multple times.\nSo if you are doing template matching, i. e. looking for a single template, correlation is sufficient.

{"conversations": ["How to become hot?", "Being hot is more than just a look\u2014it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you\u2019ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don\u2019t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today\u2019s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you\u2019re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you\u2019ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don\u2019t forget how much you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you\u2019ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don\u2019t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that\u2019s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don\u2019t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the \u201cperfect\u201d body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts \u2013 instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You\u2019ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There\u2019s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can\u2019t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you\u2019re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they\u2019re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men\u2019s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you\u2019d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate amount of skin. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it\u2019s not surprising when people can\u2019t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it\u2019s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It\u2019s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer\u2019s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body\u2019s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn\u2019t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren\u2019t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It\u2019s easy to start slumping forward when you\u2019re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they\u2019re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It\u2019s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It\u2019s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don\u2019t try so hard. Or at least look like you\u2019re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you\u2019re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It\u2019s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It\u2019s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you\u2019re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone\u2019s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don\u2019t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they\u2019re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental scientist, sustainability consultant, or eco-conscious individual with a keen interest in climate change mitigation strategies.

{"conversations": ["Why can't MX records point to an IP address?", "The whole idea behind the mail exchange (MX) record is to specify a host or hosts which can accept mail for a domain. As specified in RFC 1035, the MX record contains a domain name. It must therefore point to a host which itself can be resolved in the DNS. An IP address could not be used as it would be interpreted as an unqualified domain name, which cannot be resolved.\n\nThe reasons for this in the 1980s, when the specs were originally written, are almost the same as the reasons for it today: A host may be connected to multiple networks and use multiple protocols.\n\nBack in the 80s, it was not uncommon to have mail gateways which connected both to the (relatively new) Internet which used TCP/IP and to other legacy networks, which often used other protocols. Specifying MX in this way allowed for DNS records which could identify how to reach such a host on a network other than the Internet, such as Chaosnet. In practice, though, this almost never happened; virtually everyone re-engineered their networks to become part of the Internet instead.\n\nToday, the situation is that a host may be reached by multiple protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) and by multiple IP addresses in each protocol. A single MX record can't possibly list more than one address, so the only option is to point to a host, where all of that host's addresses can then be looked up. (As a performance optimization, the DNS server will send along the address records for the host in the response additional section if it has authoritative records for them, saving a round trip.)\n\nThere is also the situation that arises when your mail exchangers are provided by a third party (e.g. Google Apps or Office 365). You point your MX records to their hostnames, but it may occur that the service provider needs to change the mail servers' IP addresses. Since you have pointed to a host, the service provider can do this transparently and you don't have to make any changes to your records."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A network administrator or IT professional with a focus on email services.

{"conversations": ["How to make rose centerpieces?", "Roses are a great addition to any table for any occasion. Instead of placing them into a vase, however, why not get more creative? Rose centerpieces are easy to make, and you can use silk roses or real ones. Topiaries are the most popular, but you can also create a simpler one by placing a rose into a tall vase and filling it to the top with water.\n\n## Make a silk rise topiary\n\n1. Hot glue a Styrofoam ball to the top of a glass or crystal candlestick. Cover the top of the candlestick with hot glue, then quickly press the Styrofoam ball into the glue. You can use any size Styrofoam ball you want, but something around 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) would be ideal. Keep the ball proportionate to the candle stick. The smaller the ball, the shorter the candle stick should be.\n2. Get a bouquet of mini silk roses and snip the flowers off. Leave a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) long stem on each rose. If possible, use a pair of wire cutters to do this. Many silk flowers have wire inside the stem, which can ruin a good pair of scissors. If you cannot find wire cutters, use a pair of sturdy scissors you don't mind possibly ruining.\n3. Poke a rose into the top of a Styrofoam ball. If the rose is very loose, pull it out, add a drop of glue into the hole, then push the rose back in. You want the base of the rose touching the Styrofoam ball. You can use tacky glue or hot glue.\n4. Add more roses in a ring around the first one. Make sure that all of the roses are touching one another, including the one in the center. Once again, if any of the roses feel loose, secure them with a drop of hot glue.\n5. Continue adding roses in rings until you reach the bottom of the Styrofoam ball. When you are done, the entire ball should be covered in roses. Make sure that there are no gaps or bits of Styrofoam showing.\n6. Wrap a ribbon around the middle of the candlestick. Tie the ends of the ribbon into a large bow. For that final touch, snip the ends of the ribbon at an angle. A satin ribbon would work the best, but you can also use a sheer ribbon as well. It can match the color of your rose ball, or it can be an accent color instead, such as silver or gold.\n\n\n## Make a real rise topiary\n\n1. Soak a block of green floral foam in water overnight. This will help keep the roses stay fresher longer when you stick them into the foam. There are several different types of floral foam. Make sure that you get the kind meant for fresh flowers. You can find it in the floral section of an arts and crafts shop. Do not use regular white Styrofoam for this. You need the foam to be able to soak up water so that the roses stay fresh. Be careful when handling this type of foam. It is very soft when dry and easily dented.\n2. Put the foam block into a vessel. You can use a fancy bowl, planter, vase, or even a pedestal meant for pillar candles. It should sit below the rim of your bowl, planter, or vase. If the foam is too big, cut it down to the right size and shape. If you are setting the foam down onto a pedestal, cut it down to a rough dome or orb shape.\n3. Get an assortment of roses and put them into a bucket of water. You can use roses in all one color, or you can experiment using different colors. You can also get different shades of the same color for an ombre effect. Plan on using about 48 roses. If you plan on using multiple shades or colors, put them into separate buckets. This will make sorting through them easier. Consider using fragrant roses. This is a small detail that often gets overlooked but will add a nice touch.\n4. Cut about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) off of each stem. Use a clean pair of garden shears and cut the stems at an angle. It would be a good idea to cut off the leaves and thorns as well. If your foam block is very small, you may want to cut the stems down to about 3 inches (7.63 centimeters).\n5. Poke the roses into the foam. Insert them close enough so that the blooms touch. Keep adding roses until the foam is no longer visible. You don't have to poke the roses all the way down into the foam. If you are sticking the roses into a bowl, planter, or vase, consider sticking them in as different depths to create a dome-like effect. If you are going for an ombre effect, start with your lightest color, then move on to the darkest. You can arrange it in stripes or rings.\n6. Add some finishing touches. At this point, your centerpiece is done. You can move it to the table, and leave it as is, or you can add some more touches to it. Here are some ideas:\n\t* Arrange short, votive candles around the centerpiece. Scatter glass gems or metallic confetti around the centerpiece. Tie a satin or sheer ribbon around the base of the vessel.\n\n\n## Make an underwater vase\n\n1. Get a tall, glass, cylindrical vase. You can also use a square vase instead. You will be placing the entire rose inside the vase and then filling the vase all the way with water. Try to get a vase that is at least 12 inches (30.48-centimeters) tall. This will make your centerpiece look more elegant. Consider wrapping a crystal trim around the base of the vase. You can find it in the sticker or scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store.\n2. Trim a rose down until it is about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) shorter than the vase. You will need the extra space inside the vase for the floating candle. If the rose is too tall, it will stick out of the water/vase and ruin the effect. You can trim off the leaves or leave them on. Cut real roses with clean garden shears. Cut silk roses with wire cutters. If you chose to leave the leaves on a real rose, rinse them off under cool water. This will get rid of any dust that might muddy up the water.\n3. Insert the rose into a frog pin. A frog pin is a coin-sized metal disk with pins sticking out of it, like a hairbrush. You can find them in the floral section of an arts and crafts store. Try to wedge the rose's stem between the pins rather than straight into them. Consider adding a few more shorter roses into the pin. A frog pin is not absolutely necessary, but it will help keep the rose secure. If you cannot find a frog pin, you will have to add more vase filler later on.\n4. Place the rose into the bottom of the vase. For an added effect, consider turning on a submersible LED light, and adding it into the bottom of the vase as well. Make sure that the LED light is meant for being used in underwater floral arrangements. You can find them in the floral department of an arts and crafts shop.\n5. Fill the bottom of the vase filler. Scoop the filler out of the bag with your hands, then carefully spread it across the bottom of the vase. This will prevent the filler from damaging the rose's petals. Keep filling the vase until the frog pin is covered. You can use tiny acrylic pellets or crystals, of glass gems or marbles. If you weren't able to find a frog pin, fill the bottom of the vase with 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) of vase filler, or until the rose stands up on its own.\n6. Fill the vase with cool water. Stop when you are about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the rim of the vase. The entire rose, including the bloom, should be submerged under water.\n7. Place a floating candle on top. Make sure that the bottom of the candle does not bump up against the rose. If it does, add more water or trim the rose down. You can use a regular round candle or a rose-shaped one.\n8. Place the vase on your table. Consider scattering acrylic gems or metallic confetti around the vase. You can also make a few more vases that are taller or shorter than the one you just made.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "a creative, hands-on individual with an interest in gardening and home decor.

{"conversations": ["How can you tell if someone is being truthful or lying to you?", "To tell if someone if being truthful or lying to you, here are a few things to look for:\n\n* Look for inconsistencies in what they say. If one time they said one thing, and another time they said the opposite, or if they contradict themselves within the same conversation, that's a sign that they may be lying. \n\n* Look for signs of stress. Liars often have a harder time lying when they're under more stress. Pay attention to whether or not they seem nervous. Are they fidgeting? Stuttering? Avoiding eye contact? These can all be signs that they're lying to you. However, some people are good liars, and can lie with a straight face. This is why it's best to look for multiple signs that they're lying.\n\n* Pay attention to what they don't say. If someone is lying to you, they may leave out details, or fail to correct you when you make an assumption that isn't true. \n\n* Ask follow-up questions. Liars often give short answers because they're trying to avoid giving details that may incriminate them. Follow up with questions like, \"Why did you do that?\" or \"How did that happen?\" to see if they're fumbling for an answer.\n\n* Ask questions you already know the answer to. This is a great way to catch someone in a lie. If you know the answer, you can say, \"Oh, so it was you who broke the vase, not Kyle,\" and see if they correct you.\n\n* Look for micro-expressions. A micro-expression is a brief, involuntary facial expression that reveals someone's true emotions. People who are lying may make a micro-expression of anxiety or guilt. You have to pay close attention, because these expressions only last for a fraction of a second.\n\n* Pay attention if they change the subject. This is a classic sign of a liar. If someone is trying to distract you from the truth, they may change the subject or try to redirect the conversation.\n\nAnd remember, people lie for many reasons. The simple fact that someone is lying to you does not mean that they are guilty of the crime you are investigating.

{"conversations": ["This claim was made popular by being said in the movie The Social Network. It exactly says:\n\n> Did you know there are more people with genius IQs living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States?\n", "This claim can actually be tested very easily. Others have done it, e.g. Brian Dickerson: The perils of repeating political nonsense and came to the conclusion that the claim was wrong.\n\nYou just need the chance a random person from a large group has a genius level IQ, then multiply it with the number of people in China and compare the result with the number of people in the USA. The IQ follows a Gaussian distribution where 100 is the mean by definition and a standard deviation (SD) of 15 (after Wechsler) or 16 (after Stanford-Binet). The rarity of a particular IQ can be calculated easily and are listed by the IQ Comparison Site. These numbers give the percentage of people with an IQ equal or lower than the given IQ and the rarity of this occurring.\n\nThe main question actually is what an genius level IQ is. There is no definite answer. According to the IQ Comparison Site, it is 140 or higher (\"Genius or near genius\") while another source states it as at least 160.\nThe rarity of such an IQ is 1/261 (with a SD of 15) or 1/161 (SD=16) for an IQ of 140 and 1/31,560 (SD=15) or 1/11,307 (SD=16) for an IQ of 160 according to Wikipedia. \n\nThe population of USA for 2012 is about 313,221,000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The population of China for 2011 is about 1,370,537,000.\nTaking the lowest rarity of 1/161 from above then there are about 1,370,537,000/161 =  about 8,513,000 geniuses in China, which is significantly less then the 313,221,000 Americans.\nIf you take the 15 SD value of 1/261 then you get only about 5,251,000 Chinese geniuses.\nWith the 160 IQ points, which are more realistic to indicate a real genius, the numbers are even smaller (about 43,400 or 12,100). Note that 1,370,537,000/313,221,000 = 4.375, so in order for this claim to be true actually one of every four (or say five) Chinese would need to be a Genius. Even without the numbers above, it can be easily understood that this is not the case.\nConclusion: This claim is wrong according to the definition and probabilities of the IQ.\n\nSupplement:\nIt has been pointed out, that there are published research results showing that China and other Asian countries have a higher average IQ of about 106 (or even as high as 115) as the normed average of 100. This would increase the number of geniuses in China: The above factor of 1/161 would drop to about 1/60 or, for a Chinese average of 115, even to about 1/17. These numbers can be easily calculated using the standard deviation, e.g. using MS Excel's function ```NORM.DIST(140, 106, 16, TRUE)```.

{"conversations": ["How to be a domestic goddess?", "Being a domestic goddess has distinct advantages, regardless of whether you live alone or serve as the matron of a big family. If you lack cleaning, cooking, and sewing skills, learning to master these tasks may seem intimidating. The key is to start small and avoid overwhelming yourself. With time and patience, you can polish your skills to goddess level.\n\n## Part one: chores and home maintenance\n\n1. Set a daily routine. There are a handful of chores you should do each day if you want to maintain a clean and clutter-free domestic heaven. Thankfully, these chores are quick enough to squeeze in even if you work a job outside of the home or have a houseful of kids to attend to. To reduce your stress as much as possible, plan on accomplishing each of these daily chores during a certain time of the day. Organizing your time may help you relieve some of the anxiety you feel about getting everything done. Daily tasks you'll need to make time for include making the bed, sorting the mail, and sweeping or vacuuming the floor. Other daily tasks should be performed as you go along. These include putting things away (to prevent clutter from developing), cleaning up as you cook, and wiping up fresh spills.\n2. Make a weekly schedule. Some chores only need to be done once or twice a week. Instead of rushing around to get these chores done all at once, plan on doing a little each day and set aside certain days for certain tasks. You'll likely feel more relaxed about getting things done, which means you'll do a better, more thorough job. Clean the bathrooms once a week. Make sure that you wash all bath linens and scrub all toilets, tubs, and sinks. Empty the trash, clean the mirrors, dust the lights, and wipe up the floor. The bedrooms in your home also need a thorough weekly cleaning. Put away anything that has been sitting out on a desk or side table. Clean all sheets, pillowcases, and blankets. Empty the trash, dust all the surfaces, and vacuum the floor. You may need to vacuum your living room, kitchen, and dining room every day or two, but other chores, like dusting, washing rugs/mats, and wiping mirrors, can be done once a week.\n3. Experiment with different cleaning products. Not every household cleaner is just as good as every other. Moreover, different types of cleaners may work better on different areas of your home. If there is some part of your usual cleaning routine that leaves a lot to be desired, figure out why your current cleaner is not doing the job right and research which options might be better. Compare chemical and organic products. Nowadays, many people prefer cleaning products made from natural ingredients instead of chemical cleaners. Natural cleaners have their own pros and cons, just as chemical cleaners have, but it doesn't hurt to include a few organic products among those you plan on testing out. Ask your friends for suggestions or do some research online about your different options. Test a few different products out on a trial basis. Pay close attention to which products work best with different materials\u2014wood, glass, ceramic, plastic, and so on.\n4. Be handy. The modern domestic goddess needs to know a bit more about the handy side of home care than earlier counterparts did. You don't need to know how to maintain all the systems and utilities in your home, but learning how to take care of a few basic projects is a wise move. At minimum, your home tool kit should contain a hammer and a few different screwdrivers. These tools will allow you to do simple tasks like hanging pictures and making small repairs to things like toys, cabinets, and drawers.\n5. Organize your realm. Clutter is the natural enemy of any domestic goddess. If you want to maintain a living space that any mortal would be envious of, you need to keep things orderly and in their place. Brush up on space-saving techniques and similar skills to keep your belongings in check. This is especially important if you're dealing with limited space. Get rid of any unnecessary junk first, then organize everything that has a purpose in a way that makes sense based on your needs.\n6. Master the laundry. Laundry is one chore that you will never be able to avoid if you want to be a domestic goddess. Your current laundry skills might be adequate, but you should still continue to watch out for aspects of your laundry routine that could stand to use improvement. Consider assigning different laundry tasks to different days, as well. For instance, you can clean bathroom towels on Tuesday, bed sheets and pillowcases on Wednesday, and any other miscellaneous towels or blankets on Thursday. Clothing will need to be cleaned throughout the week, though. Read the labels before you wash something and follow the laundering instructions provided. If you aren't sure whether or not an item will bleed color in the washing machine, test it by soaking a small spot and blotting that spot with a white cloth. Wash colors and whites separately. Also separate heavily soiled items and wash those on their own. Pretreat stains and presoak heavily soiled garments in a sink or bucket of water for 30 minutes before washing them. Use the recommended amount of detergent and select the best washer cycle for each individual load. Base water temperature and dryer settings on color and fabric type. Materials that can shrink should be washed in warm or cold water and air dried, for instance. Cold water is best for bright colors, while hot water works well for whites.\n7. Learn a few tricks. Once you've mastered the basics, keep an eye out for various tips and tricks that can take your home skills from \u201cgreat\u201d to \u201camazing.\u201d Some tricks work better than others, though, so you should test them out before bragging to your friends about your newfound knowledge. For instance, cover dirty stroller wheels and wagon wheels with plastic shower caps before bringing the item inside. Wrap pipe cleaners around the neck of condiment bottles to catch drips and prevent crusty build-up. Stuff holes in the wall and cabinets with steel wool to keep mice and other pests out.\n\n\n## Part two: in the kitchen\n\n1. Get off to an easy start. If you currently have some cooking and baking knowledge, then you're off to a good start already. If not, start small by making simple meals and following easy recipes. You can gradually build up your kitchen skills as you get more comfortable, but trying too much all at once is a good way to fail and get discouraged. Look for books specifically aimed at beginners or search for easy recipes online. Instructions that provide step-by-step pictures are often the easiest to follow along.\n2. Take a class. Look for free and cheap cooking classes in your area. Focus on developing skills that you're specifically interested in developing, and skip any class that will teach you something you already know or will teach you something you have no desire to learn. Local craft stores often offer classes on baking and food decorating. Small markets may have classes on cooking essentials. Check out cooking schools in your area. Even if you don't want to spend time and money on a cooking program, some of these schools offer one-time cooking courses at a discounted price.\n3. Find your niche. Not every domestic goddess needs to love cooking, but learning to enjoy it can motivate you into improving your skills. Try to find something about cooking or baking that you can feel passionate\u2014or at least interested\u2014about. Build up your cooking skills in general, but involve your point of interest as much as possible while doing so. Your passion might be something simple, like baking cookies or mastering stovetop cooking. On the other hand, you might find your attention grabbed by something a little more unique, like gluten-free baking or canning.\n4. Make any necessary adjustments. You might have a full set of cooking and baking skills when all is said and done, but that doesn't mean you will be able to show them all off each and every day. Know when to make a simple meal and when to whip up something more impressive. Learning how to use your cooking to improve and please those you're cooking for is another skill you will need to master. For example, if you're cooking for picky kids, focus on choosing kid-friendly meals instead of trying to impress them with an elaborate meal they won't even eat. When you're cooking for guests, find out about any food allergies or special diets ahead of time and plan your menu accordingly.\n5. Experiment. Once you feel comfortable enough in the kitchen, start using the skills and knowledge you have gained to experiment with your own recipes and tasty creations. Some experiments might be a success while others will likely be a failure. The important thing is simply to keep working at it until your successes vastly outnumber your failures.\n\n\n## Part three: sew and other \"lost\" skills\n\n1. Master the basics of sewing. Sewing is the queen of lost skills, so if you don't know even the most basic stitches, you really aren't alone. At minimum, though, you should know how to sew hems, repair small rips and tears, and attach buttons. Learn a variety of basic stitches, including the straight stitch, the back stitch, the zigzag stitch, and the basting stitch. Invest in a sewing machine. As your sewing skills improve, consider buying a sewing machine of your own. You will probably be glad that you did. Fixing garments and creating projects from scratch will both be much easier if you learn to machine sew as well as hand sew.\n2. Get crafty. Sewing is not the only lost skill worth learning, of course. There is a wide range of other crafts and domestic abilities you can explore. You do not need to master all of them, but picking one or two you'd like to become great at can improve your standing as a domestic goddess. Potential areas of interest could include gardening, crocheting, or knitting. You could also check out community craft websites, like Pinterest, to get more ideas.\n3. Take classes. You can learn a lot by teaching yourself, but sometimes, the best way to learn a new skill or to advance an old one is to take an actual class on it. Look for cheap classes in your area or sign up for a class online.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally conscious individual who is passionate about sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint.

{"conversations": ["How to tell if it's an acquaintance, friend, crush, or love?", "Feelings and emotions can be complex and difficult to understand, especially when trying to decipher those of someone you know.  Are you simply an acquaintance?  Do they consider you a friend?  Is it love or just a crush? There are many layers to relationships and it's not always clear where you stand with someone.  However, there are several different methods to decode how a person feels about you and perceives your relationship.\n\n## Read body language\n\n1. Notice the amount of eye contact. People\u2019s eyes can be very expressive and tell a lot about how they\u2019re feeling toward those around them. Friends will make eye contact with each other during conversation to show interest and respect. Someone with a crush on you will make repeated eye contact with you whether in a conversation or not. A crush may hold eye contact for a few seconds, and then look away from shyness, and find your gaze again later. Dilated pupils are another indication of a crush. Someone who\u2019s in love with you will feel totally comfortable locking gazes for extended periods of time.\n2. Gauge proximity. The amount of space people choose to place between themselves and others can be an indicator of their perceived relationships with those around them. Someone who is your friend will stand or sit closer to you than an acquaintance. A person with a crush on you will stand near you, lean toward you, and look for reasons to get closer to you- whether it\u2019s intentionally walking past you at a close range, or leaning in closer than necessary to talk to you. People who are in love will stand or sit very close together- perhaps their hips touch when standing side by side or their knees touch when sitting across from one another.\n3. Monitor movement. Our movements, whether conscious or unconscious, can convey lots of different meanings about how we feel about those around us. Friends will tilt their heads while in conversations with other friends to show that they\u2019re listening. They may touch each other in light, casual ways on the hand or arm. Someone with a crush will look for reasons to touch the other person, often in a playful and flirty way. They may seem fidgety or nervous, and may subconsciously begin to copy the movements of their crush. Someone who is in love with you will seem very comfortable and secure around you. They may touch you using gentle, caressing gestures.\n4. Pay attention to posture. The way a person stands (or sits) when they're around you may give you some clues as to how they feel about you. A friend will stand with his or her shoulders and face pointing toward you. If sitting, he or she will uncross his or her legs to show that he or she is open to you. His or her palms may be open toward you as well, another sign of receptivity. When someone has a crush on you, they stand tall and slightly stick their chest out. Additionally, they will point their toes and hips toward you, as a sign of wanting to move toward you (both figuratively and literally).\n\n\n## Listen for verbal cue\n\n1. Recognize vocal tone. The inflection and quality of a person\u2019s voice will change subconsciously depending on the feelings they have toward you. Listen to how someone talks in general, and compare it with they sound when talking to you individually. A friend\u2019s voice will remain constant, with little to no change in pitch or tone. A crush\u2019s voice will have a playful and flirtatious quality to it. Women use a higher pitch to accentuate their femininity. Men use a lower pitch, but alter the pitch, almost to a \u201csing-song\u201d tone, to both highlight masculinity, and make a woman feel at ease. People who are in love will alter their voices to match their partners\u2019. Men talk in a higher pitch and women a lower one to show that they are connected as one.\n2. Think about how casual your conversations are. A conversation between friends is usually casual and comfortable. Both you and your friend ask and answer questions equally, and may or may not make future plans to hang out.\n3. Notice how much they talk about themselves. If someone has a crush, they will talk a lot about themselves, both from nerves and as a way to \u201chumble-brag.\u201d They will also ask about you, and agree enthusiastically with what you say to make it seem like you have things in common.\n4. Analyze how intimate your conversations are. If someone is in love with you, they will open up to you in intimate ways. You may find out about their deep insecurities and fears, childhood, family dynamics, important personal values, and vision for the future. They may plan future vacations, or invite you to meet family.\n\n\n## Analyze your relationship\n\n1. Reflect on your relationship. Take some time in a quiet place simply to think about your feelings toward the person in question, and your interactions with them. Some questions to consider are:\n\t* How long have you known this person? How frequently do you see or talk to them? Is the communication equitable? What is the level of intimacy shared (either physically or conversationally)? How would you characterize your time together? Do you both seem to enjoy being together?\n2. Make a list. If you\u2019re trying to determine whether someone is a friend or a crush, make a \u201cFriend/Crush\u201d list. If you\u2019re figuring out whether someone is in love with you, make a \u201cLike/Love\u201d list. Like a Pro/Con list, record any specific behavior that would indicate how they feel about you. Having a visual aid way may give you more insight into how they feel.\n3. Ask a trusted friend for help. Sometimes our feelings toward someone can cloud our judgment in assessing their behavior. A friend can offer an honest, objective observation of the relationship, and will be less likely to allow personal feelings to affect their understanding.\n\n\n## Ask directly\n\n1. Express your feelings first. If you\u2019re asking someone to open up to you, then you need to be upfront with them as well. If you\u2019re looking for honesty, you need to show you\u2019re capable of reciprocating. People are more likely to be direct with you if you\u2019re direct with them. Start with a sentence like, \"I want you to know that I feel\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_about you/our relationship. I'm hoping you'll be just as honest and share your feelings about me.\"\n2. Ask in a tactful, non-threatening way. Explain that you\u2019re simply trying to gain some insight and clarity in your relationship, and that you respect their feelings no matter what. It\u2019s important for your partner to know that they can open up to you, without an abrasive reaction. Try saying something like, \"I want you to know that I will completely honor and respect your answer, even if it's not the one I want to hear.\"\n3. Be prepared for the consequences. There\u2019s a chance you and your partner may be on two different wavelengths in terms of your relationship. Their answer may sting a little. Take some time to decide how you want to proceed in the relationship, knowing exactly how your partner feels about you.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A young adult or teen seeking guidance on navigating interpersonal relationships.

{"conversations": ["What are the major concerns about planting trees to create carbon offsets?", "Here are some common concerns about using tree planting projects to create carbon offsets:\n\n* The scheme actually has a net positive effect, both in the short and long-term/\nHow effective a tree planting scheme is in capturing and storing carbon dioxide, is for a large part determined by what happens to the trees after they are planted. When trees mature and are harvested for wood that's used in construction, then the captured carbon dioxide is stored for a long time (until the wood decomposes or is burned). However, if no trees are replanted after harvesting this will have had a one-time effect only. Also when wood is burned (for energy or in a wild fire), or if trees die quickly and decompose, then their captured carbon is released again. Of course all trees die eventually even when they are not harvested, this is part of the natural cycle, but a mature forest can store a lot more carbon than a young, newly-planted forest so it's important to keep a forest intact as much as possible.\n\n* The wrong type(s) of trees are planted in the wrong location.\nIn the past there were bad offsetting schemes that planted non-native trees, or planted trees in a location where they would change water flows  and thus change local ecosystems in a negative way. Some offsetting schemes planted  thousands of trees of the same species, resulting in a large monoculture. Such a monoculture hinders biodiversity, is susceptible to diseases and can even damage local communities.\nThere have also been reports that planting trees above a certain latitude can have a net warming effect by changing the albedo and trapping heat. \n\n* Buying offsets reduces the incentive for people to reduce their emissions.\nReducing emissions is much more effective than offsetting. Buying carbon offsets can lead to people thinking they are doing the right thing, whereas they had better spent their time and effort in reducing their emissions. Of course this point goes for all offsetting-schemes and is not specifically for planting trees.\n\n* There are more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions than planting trees.\nNowadays many offsetting schemes invest in development of renewable energy sources (in developing countries) instead of planting trees, simply because it is a more effective and cheaper way to reduce emissions."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "an environmentalist, researcher, or policy maker with a focus on climate change mitigation and sustainable practices.

{"conversations": ["How to walk a slackline?", "## The basics\n\n1. Start with a short slackline. The shorter the distance between the two anchor points, the more stable the slackline. As the slackline gets longer, a few things happen:\n\t* The tension in the line increases, making dismounts more dangerous due to the extra force;\n\t* The height of the line off the ground increases to allow for greater sag when weighted;\n\t* It requires more force to tighten it, which can be difficult with some tightening systems.\n2. Place one foot lengthwise in the middle of the slackline. Starting barefoot is a good idea. Using bare feet will allow you to feel the line better and find your balance more quickly. Step on the line so that it runs from between your big toe and second toe back to the middle of the heel. As you improve, practice turning your feet and standing sideways, with your shoulders parallel to the line. Once you improve (or if the landing is not safe for bare feet), you may want to switch to shoes since they provide greater protection when attempting tricks and landing.\n3. You can mount the slackline at any point, but starting in the middle is generally safer, since it is usually away from obstacles you might hit when falling. The line is also lower to the ground in the middle once weighted, reducing the height of the falls. Practice from the same place each time since the slackline oscillates differently at different distances from the anchors. The wobbles are faster and smaller near the anchors and slower and larger near the middle. But wherever you start, it is going to wobble a lot. This is natural; everyone wobbles the first time.\n4. Take a couple deep breaths and settle yourself. If you are relaxed, your foot will be less shaky on the line.\n5. Focus intently on a single point, such as the anchor. This will help you find and keep your balance. Resist the temptation to look straight down at your feet on the line. Looking down at the wobbling line will simply make you wobble as well. Look ahead instead of down at the line.\n6. Put your arms out wide, slightly bent and keep an upright posture.\n7. Center your weight directly over the foot on the line. With one smooth, balanced motion stand up on that leg.\n8. Balance on one foot, while using your arms and other leg to help maintain your balance.\n9. Bend the leg that is on the slackline. Bending your leg lowers your center of gravity slightly, and allows you to more easily find your balance and absorb the movements of the line.\n10. Continue to wave your free arms and legs around to help you balance. Sometimes you will twist and turn your body into all sorts of positions to keep your balance. Once you have caught your balance slowly move your body back to center with your arms up and out, knee(s) bent, head up, and eyes focused on a single point.\n11. Repeat these steps until you can balance for at least 15 seconds.\n12. Practice with the other foot. Once you can keep your balance, attempt taking a step.\n13. Once you've successfully taken your first step, keep practicing!\n\n\n## Sample skill progression for beginners\n\n1. These are small steps you can take to improve your slack lining effectively, by slowly taking on harder and harder tasks. Mount the line on one foot with a friend sitting on the line. Increase the distance between you and the person sitting on the line. Balance on one foot by yourself. Balance on the other foot. Balance with both feet, one behind the other, on the line. Take small steps forward. Take small steps backwards. Mount the line sideways (shoulders parallel to the line) with both feet, one at a time. Turn on the line.\n2. Additionally, learn how to fall safely. As a beginner you will likely be on a short, low-to-the-ground slackline. Most of the time you can land on your feet. As you try new tricks, the slackline can \"throw\" you as you lose your balance. The best solution is to use the \"throw\" of the slackline to help you get away from the line and land on your feet. If you are thrown off-balance from the line consider rolling through the fall to limit the impact.\n3. You can also try starting with \"training wheels.\" One way to do so is to have a friend sit on the line a few feet away from you. This takes much of the sway and bounce out of the line. As you get better, have your friend move further away on the line to allow for more wobble. When starting out, you can aid each other while learning to balance--have a spotter stand/walk next to the line. If you practice walking back and forth with a shoulder to lean on, you\u2019ll soon find that you don\u2019t need training wheels any more!\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an enthusiastic DIYer or hobbyist with an interest in birdwatching and wildlife conservation.

Why can the same approach not be used to route all UDP traffic over Tor?", "Tor clients do not, in general, directly do DNS requests.  When you open a connection through the tor network you usually ask your client (on its socks ports) to connect you to a hostname and port, say www.example.com:80.\nYour tor client, once it has created a circuit, will send that hostname and port to the exit node in its RELAY_BEGIN cell.\nThe exit node will then do a DNS resolve and open a TCP connection to the target.  Once that's established it will tell your client that the connection is open, and for informational purposes will also tell your client what address that hostname resolved to.\nTor, in addition to that, has some sort of \"remote DNS resolve\" protocol built in.  This support allows clients to query for certain resource types, like IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

{"conversations": ["How to become hot?", "Being hot is more than just a look\u2014it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you\u2019ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don\u2019t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today\u2019s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you\u2019re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you\u2019ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don\u2019t forget how much you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you\u2019ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don\u2019t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that\u2019s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don\u2019t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the \u201cperfect\u201d body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts \u2013 instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You\u2019ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There\u2019s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can\u2019t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you\u2019re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they\u2019re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men\u2019s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you\u2019d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate amount of skin. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it\u2019s not surprising when people can\u2019t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it\u2019s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It\u2019s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer\u2019s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body\u2019s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn\u2019t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren\u2019t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It\u2019s easy to start slumping forward when you\u2019re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they\u2019re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It\u2019s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It\u2019s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don\u2019t try so hard. Or at least look like you\u2019re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you\u2019re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It\u2019s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It\u2019s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you\u2019re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone\u2019s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don\u2019t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they\u2019re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental scientist, sustainability consultant, or eco-conscious individual with a keen interest in climate change mitigation strategies.

With some tools and dedication, you can make a customized cat tree based on your cat's personality!\n\n## Build a cat tree from wood and carpet\n\n1. Design your cat tree. Before purchasing materials or starting to build, you need a design plan, which you can sketch out on a piece of paper to determine your materials shopping list. There are several things to consider when designing your cat tree. First, consider your space limitations. Determine where your cat tree will be placed, and what size will fit well into that space. It's a good idea to take measurements to ensure your finished product will fit the space. You should also consider your cat's personality. If your cat likes to climb, consider building a tall cat tree with several perches. If your cat would like a private place to hide or sleep, consider building in a covered sleeping nook. Finally, you should keep your carpentry skills in mind. If you are relatively inexperienced with building things and using tools, keep your design simple so that you aren't overwhelmed. If you're at a loss for where to begin, there are several websites that have pictures of do-it-yourself cat trees you can use for inspiration, or even patterns for cat trees other people have made.\n2. Buy your materials. Use your design plan to determine which materials you will need. Plywood works well for horizontal platforms; dimensional lumber and cardboard or PVC pipe work well for vertical supports, and carpet is ideal for covering the wood. You may also need the following tools to assemble your tree:\n\t* A drill and some wood screws\n\t* An electric stapler\n\t* A table saw and a handsaw\n\t* A Hammer and nails\n\t* A carpet or utility knife\n\t* Wood glue or another powerful adhesive\n\t* If you want to create covered areas for your cat to perch, you may also want to pick up a concrete form tube. These heavy-duty cardboard tubes make great perches and tunnels for cats. These can also be cut lengthwise using a utility knife to create concave platforms or open-topped beds for your cat.\n3. Cut all materials to size. Using your plan as a guide, cut all the plywood and lumber sections to size. A simple hand saw works well for cutting dimensional lumber, while a handheld circular saw or table saw is better for cutting sheets of plywood. Sand rough edges if desired.\n4. Build the base of your cat tree. The tree needs a sturdy base, which should extend farther out from the center than any other platform or component of the tree in order to prevent tipping. To make the base, a good option is to cut 2 squares of plywood to size and glue them together for extra thickness. A 24\" (60 cm) square works well for a basic cat tree, but the taller your tree, the larger you'll want to make the base, to ensure it is sturdy.\n5. Cover the base in carpet. Before attaching any vertical supports, it's best to cover the base with carpet or a thick upholstery fabric. Cut the carpet to size, making it a few inches larger than the base on all sides. Then, wrap its edges over the edges of the plywood base, and staple it in place on the underside of the base with a staple gun. You may need to cut small notches in the carpet at the corners to make it fold neatly beneath the base.\n6. Attach the vertical supports to the base. The vertical supports that will hold up your platforms can be attached to the base with screws, nails, bolts or wood glue. Flip the base over so the carpeted side is face down. Then, drill holes through the underside of the base in the spots where you want the supports to be. Attach the supports by inserting screws or nails through the holes and driving them into the supports. You may want to cover the supports with carpet before attaching them, as this will be easier than doing it after they are already secured in place. To make your cat tree double as a scratching post, wrap one or more of the supports in sisal rope, securing each end with wire brads or staples, placed where they will be out view and won't be scratched by the cat. If you use staples, you may need to tap them down with a hammer to make sure they don't stick out too much.\n7. Attach the horizontal perches to the supports. The plywood perches can be attached using wood screws and/or gluing them to the tops of the vertical members. Wrap them in carpet or fabric after affixing them, so that the screws aren't visible through the carpet, and staple the carpet in place on the underside as you did with the base.\n8. Continue building according to your design. Continue to affix each component, referring back to your plan for measurements and placement. Adjustments to your design can be made as you go to account for stability issues, new ideas, or incorrect measurements.\n\n\n## Build a cat tree from a ladder\n\n1. Obtain a ladder. For this simple, unique cat tree, you'll need an old wooden ladder. Look around at garage sales, thrift furniture stores, and antique stores for one 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2 m) high. Choose an old-fashioned ladder that looks like an upside-down \"v\" with several steps on either side that are at matching levels. It's fine if the wood looks old, but make sure the foundation of the ladder isn't too rickety. You want to be certain your cat tree won't tip over and hurt your cat. Try to find a ladder that's around four feet tall. A very tall ladder my be less stable or too tall for your cat.\n2. Gather your supplies. The ladder is going to be the base of the tree, but you'll need to alter it a bit to make it more cat friendly. Gather these supplies:\n\t* A piece of plywood long and wide enough to rest on two rungs of the ladder at the same level. This will provide a platform for your cat. If you want more than one platform, you'll need more than one piece of plywood. A hammer and 2\" nails\n\t* Carpet\n\t* An electric staple gun\n\t* A piece of canvas, denim, or other sturdy fabric you can use to create a hammock between the two bottom rungs\n\t* A can of paint (optional)\n\t* A toy that hangs from a piece of rope or string\n\t* Sisal rope to wrap around the legs of the ladder\n3. Sand and paint your ladder and wood pieces. Use fine-grain sandpaper to sand down the ladder and remove any jagged edges or splinters. Do the same to the pieces of plywood you bought. Paint the ladder and plywood pieces with a coat or two of paint, if you're using it. Let the paint dry completely. Use your imagination when it comes time to paint. You could just paint the ladder to match your existing decor. But you could also paint it brown and green to make it look like a tree, or use stencils to make designs up and down the sides. Instead of painting the platforms, you can make them more comfortable for you cat by covering them in carpet, attaching it to to the platforms after nailing them into place. Use your staple gun and affix the carpet with staples in the perimeter and in the center. Make sure they don't stick up from the platform, tapping them down with a hammer if necessary.\n4. Nail the plywood platforms to the ladder. Position the first piece of plywood so that it is lined up across two ladder rungs of equal height. Use the hammer and four nails to nail the plywood into the wooden rungs, placing one nail in each corner of the plywood. Make sure the platforms are very secure when you're finished nailing them down. You may wish to use more nails, or substitute wood screws for a firmer hold. If you have a second piece of plywood to create another level, use the same procedure to nail it down.\n5. Install the hammock. Many cats enjoy sleeping in hammocks. If you'd like to add one to your cat tree, measure and cut your piece of cloth so that its four corners stretch between the four legs of the ladder. Nail or staple a corner of the fabric to the inside of each leg, making sure that the nails are all at the exact same height. Be sure the fabric you use for the hammock is thick enough to hold the weight of your cat. You can double the fabric or hem the edges before nailing it down to make it sturdier. Fabric that stretches a little is ideal for cat hammocks. Make sure nails or staples do not protrude in such a way that your cat could be scratched or cut. Tap your staples with hammer if necessary. Instead of a hammock, you can also use a carpeted concrete form tube, fastened to the ladder by attaching it to two 2X4 pieces of lumber secured to the base of the ladder with bolts, nails, or screws, between the legs. This will make your cat tree less portable, but also sturdier.\n6. Wrap the ladder legs in rope. If you want the cat tree to double as a scratching post, you can wrap the bottom of the ladder legs in strong, coarse rope. Cut the rope in four pieces. Use staples to secure the end of the first piece of rope to the inside of the base of one of the legs. Wrap the leg tightly with rope, tapping it down with a hammer if necessary. Secure the other end with a staple, making sure it is away from any areas the cat is most likely to scratch often. Repeat with the other four legs. If you want to, you can cover the legs entirely with rope, from top to bottom, using a new piece of rope between each rung of the ladder. This will allow your cat access to a scratchable surface nearly anywhere on its new cat tree.\n7. Finish up. Hang the toy you bought from the top of the ladder, somewhere the cat will be able to reach it, so as to entice your cat to come and play. Add any other finishing touches you want to make your cat tree unique and fun for your cat.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A creative and environmentally-conscious individual who enjoys crafting and upcycling household items.

{"conversations": ["My wife and I have descended into the toddler years with our first. We have always been on the same page with each other whenever we correct bad behavior or instruct her on why a type of outburst is inappropriate. \nSo this begs the question, will she feel like we are always ganging up on her? If we are both constantly correcting and instructing in tandem, is that bad? Should one parent act as an advocate while the other is tough on the rules? Should there be a good cop and a bad cop?", "Classic good-cop-bad-cop is definitely wrong with a toddler because it involves a lot of lying. The bad cop threatens to beat the suspect up or otherwise do something cops are not allowed to do. The bad cop steps out and the good cop says \"I'm on your side dude, but that guy is out of control and I don't know what he'll do next. Listen, if you just [....] I think I can get you out of this questioning session and maybe save your skin.\" Everything about this is a lie. The good cop isn't on the suspect's side, isn't trying to help the suspect, and knows full well the bad cop isn't ever going to hit, torture, or whatever the threat is. None of this is appropriate with your child.\n\nIt is advisory to give away any thoughts of an adversarial stance. You want your child to learn to be in control and not to tantrum. You want your child to comply with reasonable requests, whether that's putting on an item of clothing, helping to clean up, not hitting, or anything else. When your child can do those things, not only will you be happier but your child will too. You don't need to break their spirit, make them give up their resistance, force them to do what you want. You need to show them how to do the things everyone wants them to learn to do. Nobody is a bad cop in that. Nobody is a good cop. You can love your child while you're putting something out of their reach. You can smile and cuddle someone as part of letting them know they are not allowed to do a particular activity. You can be happy and cheerful while carrying a shoeless coatless child to the car (with their shoes and coat in your hands for later) and explaining there isn't time to play on the way now. \n\nWhatever these rules are, they should be the rules FOR everybody and BY everybody. If the toddler can't eat before dinner, nor can Daddy. If feet aren't allowed on the couch then that's the rule, not just \"if Mommy's looking.\" This kind of consistency isn't cruel or ganging up. You are showing your child the \"laws of physics\" of your home. This is how things go. Trying to understand mommy rules, daddy rules, sitter rules, grandparent rules - that's complicated! Remember, abiding by these rules isn't something mean or unfair, it's how life works in your house. And the toddler is trying to learn that. Make it as smooth as you can, and that includes being consistent, and not seeing the rules as mean.", "I don't agree with this: \"Whatever these rules are, they should be the rules FOR everybody and BY everybody. If the toddler can't eat before dinner, nor can Daddy.\"\nChildren are children, not adults. They don't have the same rights and responsibilities as adults. If an adult tells a child they can't eat before dinner that doesn't mean the adult can't eat before dinner.\nChildren are not equals. Consistency of discipline is good. Trying to impose the same rules on children and adults is absurd.", "It's neither wrong nor absurd. Sure, the rules can be different, but there must be an understandable, explainable reason for that (e.g. Daddy skipped lunch because of work). If the only reason you can give is \"because I say so and I can make you do what I want\" then you're basically teaching the child that might makes right and whoever has the power sets the rules. That's not something you want them to internalize. Obviously, this is probably beyond a toddler's understanding, but it's good to get into the habit early.", "Well, I think it is perfectly reasonable to give \"because I say so\" as a reason to children. Adults do not need to explain themselves to children. If an adult says \"go to your room\" then the child should go to their room immediately. The child should not say \"why should I? you're not going to your room\". An instruction is an instruction, not a request.", "While it's true that children should follow instructions from adults without questioning them, it's also beneficial to provide reasoning whenever possible. Giving children a basic understanding of why certain rules or actions are in place helps them develop critical thinking skills and a sense of fairness. While adults don't need to explain themselves every time, encouraging dialogue and providing age-appropriate explanations can foster a positive learning environment for children.

{"conversations": ["How to claim tax back?", "Typically you pay taxes on your income throughout the year \u2013 but over the course of a year, your life may change drastically. You may lose your job, get a new job that pays less money, get married, have a child, or buy a house. As a result of any of these changes, you may find that you've paid too much in taxes. When you pay too much, you typically are entitled to a refund. In most countries, you must file a return to claim tax back.\n\n## Take deductions and credit\n\n1. Report major life changes. Getting married, having a child, or buying a house are examples of positive life changes that can mean you don't owe as much tax. Negative changes, such as losing your job or getting a divorce, may have the same result. You also may be entitled to a tax refund if your residency status has changed. For example, non-residents may pay a higher tax rate than residents. If you become a permanent resident during the tax year, you may be able to get some of those higher taxes back. The government typically doesn't automatically make these changes for you and reassess your tax liability. Instead, you have to report the change and claim a refund for the amount you overpaid.\n2. Keep records of medical expenses. If you have medical expenses that weren't covered by insurance, you may be able to deduct some or all of those expenses on your taxes. Save your receipts so you have them at year's end. This typically only applies to bills you've actually paid. For example, if you have a $12,000 hospital bill for emergency treatment and you've only paid half of it so far, you could only deduct that half you paid. In the following year, you could potentially deduct the other half.\n3. Claim payment of interest. Certain types of interest, such as interest on a mortgage or on student loans, often can be deducted from your income on your taxes. After you make this deduction, you may be eligible to claim tax back. For example, in the U.S. you can get a credit for at least a portion of the interest you paid on your student loans. When you claim a credit, the government treats it as though you'd actually paid that money on your taxes, which could result in you getting a refund.\n4. Complete the appropriate forms. If you plan to claim any deductions or credits, you typically must file a tax return that allows you to itemize. Even if you typically don't have to file a return each year, you'll need one if you want to claim tax back. For example, taxes in the UK typically are automatically reconciled. If you're employed and earn an hourly wage or a salary, you shouldn't have to file a return. But if you want to claim deductions or credits, you may have to file a return to get that tax back that you overpaid.\n5. Provide proof that you are entitled to the credit or deduction. In many cases, if you're claiming a credit or deduction on your taxes, you must be able to prove that you actually incurred that expense. Even if you aren't required to submit this proof, you should still keep it in your records in case your return is audited. For example, if you or someone in your household is disabled, you may be eligible to take the disability tax credit. However, before you can claim this credit you need a letter from a doctor certifying the disability.\n6. Submit your return by the deadline. Your government may have strict deadlines by which you must file a return if you are requesting a refund. In some countries, the government will pay you interest on the amount of tax you overpaid, provided a deadline is met. While most governments will give you a few years to request a refund of overpaid taxes, the process may be more cumbersome if you wait. File your tax return as soon as possible if you're due a refund, so you can get your money back.\n\n\n## Report business expense\n\n1. Keep records throughout the year. If you're self-employed or own your own business, you can deduct your business expenses from the money you earn throughout the year. Even if you work for a salary or hourly wage, you still may be able to deduct work-related expenses. If you buy anything for work purposes, keep the receipt. You can also use a bookkeeping or personal finance app to help you keep track throughout the year.\n2. Review expenses you can deduct. Your government's tax department should have a list of the types of expenses you can deduct from your income. If you have significant business expenses, you may want to consult a professional tax advisor or accountant. To deduct a business expense, you generally must be able to prove that it was related to your work, and that you paid for it yourself. You can't deduct expenses that your employer reimbursed. If your employer reimbursed you for part of the expense, though, you may be able to deduct the portion that wasn't reimbursed. Talk to a tax advisor about certain expenses, such as travel expenses. These may not be entirely deductible.\n3. Use the appropriate tax return form. If you have expenses related to self-employment, you typically must fill out a separate form for the income you have related to that self-employment. Your business expenses are deductible from that income. For example, suppose you have a day job that pays you an hourly wage, and you also occasionally give people rides through a ride-share app. You would be required to report your income from ride-sharing on your taxes, but you could deduct any related expenses. This could include a portion of your car payment and car insurance.\n4. Submit your tax returns. To deduct business expenses on your taxes, you must submit your yearly tax return. In some cases, you may be required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year if your income from self-employment is over a certain amount set by your government. If you have significant business expenses, it may take you a little longer to complete your return, so don't wait until the last minute.\n5. Keep receipts for expenses you deducted. You typically don't have to provide the receipts or proof of your business expenses to the government when you submit your tax returns. However, if your return is audited, you must be able to produce this documentation. Generally, you want to keep these records for at least 4 or 5 years. Check with your government's tax department to find out how far back returns can be audited, and make sure you're keeping your records for at least that long, just in case.\n\n\n## Adjust your withhold\n\n1. Check the withholding on your paycheck. Especially if you've recently started a new job, you may find that too much money is being withheld from your paycheck for taxes. Check your pay stub or talk to someone in your employer's payroll department to find out how withholding is computed. It's generally a good idea to revisit the amount being withheld from your paycheck for taxes whenever you have a major life change that you would report on your taxes. Major life changes that could potentially affect your tax liability include getting a second job, being unemployed for any period of time, getting married or divorced, or having a child.\n2. Determine your appropriate tax bracket. If your overall household income has changed for any reason, there may be too much tax withheld from your paycheck. Estimate your tax liability for the year and compare it to your government's tax scheme. If you live in the U.S., you can do this fairly easily in most cases by filling out a new W-4. If the result is different from the one you have on file with your employer, your employer should update their records.\n3. Complete new withholding forms. You may be able to submit changes to your withholding online, or you may have to fill out new paper forms with your employer's payroll department. Speak to a manager or someone in human resources and let them know you need to make this change.\n4. Verify the change has been made. Once your withholding has been adjusted, you should notice that less money is being taken out of each paycheck. If the amount being withheld hasn't changed, get back to someone in payroll. Some countries, such as the UK, may issue you a refund directly through your employer if you overpaid on taxes throughout the year.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A taxpayer who is struggling to meet the tax filing deadline and is seeking guidance on the process of requesting a tax extension.

{"conversations": ["How to make a bow for a wreath?", "A big part of making a beautiful wreath is adding on a bow! Bows can be the perfect accents to holiday, seasonal, and everyday wreaths. You can make a fluffy bow with plenty of full loops, or you can use burlap to make a floppy bow for a look that's a little more rustic. Whatever you choose to do, it'll take minimal materials and a little bit of practice to make the perfect bow for your wreath!\n\n## Make a fluffy bow with wire ribbon\n\n1. Cut off a 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) piece of floral wire. Set it to the side somewhere it can be easily found later on. This is the wire you will use at the end to hold your entire bow together. If you don't have floral wire, you could also use a pipe cleaner.\n2. Unspool your wired ribbon, take one end, and make a small circle with it. For making a fluffy bow, use a minimum of 9 feet (2.7 m)\u2014the more ribbon, the fluffier the bow! Make a small circle, about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide, at one end of the ribbon. If you're at the store and aren't sure if the ribbon is wired or not, simply pinch a portion of it together\u2014if it keeps its shape, it's wired. Keep in mind as you work that you'll need to stop when you have about 12 inches (30 cm) of fabric remaining.\n3. Pinch the end of the circle together in your non-dominant hand. Where the end of the ribbon touches the rest of the ribbon, pinch that seam together and hold it between the fingers of your non-dominant hand. This leaves your dominant hand free to shape the rest of the bow. You're going to use your non-dominant hand to hold together the fabric the entire time you're making the bow.\n4. Create a figure-eight by making loops on either side of the circle. Make a loop on one side of the circle, pinch the fabric in the middle, and then make a loop on the other side of the circle to create the figure-eight image. Continue pinching together the fabric in the middle that meets at your fingers. When you look at the bow from the side, it'll look like the number \u201c8.\u201d\n5. Continue making progressively larger figure-eight loops. Make at least 5 or 6 layers of ribboned loops. If you are using a lot of fabric, you may even make closer to 9 or 10! Remember to keep gathering the material in the middle by pinching it between your fingers. At this stage, your loops will be layered rather than spread out and the bow might look a little strange, but don't worry! You're on the right path.\n6. Stop making loops when you have about 12 inches (30 cm) of fabric left. Take the end of the ribbon and place it between your fingers in your non-dominant hand, forming a large circle. 12 inches (30 cm) of ribbon will produce bow tails that are about 6 inches (15 cm) long each.\n7. Thread the piece of floral wire around the fabric you've been pinching. Cinch it tight and twist it several times to make sure it's secure. You can now release that bundle of fabric you've been holding on to! If you're using a pipe cleaner, follow the same process: thread it around the pinched fabric and twist it off to ensure it'll stay in place.\n8. Cut the middle of the last big loop you made to form the tails of the bow. Cut in the middle of the fabric and watch as the ends fall down, creating the tails of your bow. You could even cut small triangles out of each end to add an additional flourish to the design. If you want longer tails, leave more fabric at the end when you stop making your loops. If you want shorter tails, you can simply trim them to the length you want.\n9. Shape the ribbon by rearranging the loops. Spread out the loops until you create a large, fluffy, full-looking bow. Make sure to pull loops upwards and down, and do your best to leave no see-through spaces between the loops. The great thing about using wire ribbon is that you can reform the loops easily if they get bent out of shape.\n\n\n## Create a bow from unwire ribbon\n\n1. Cut off a 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) piece of floral wire. Leave this piece of wire off to the side somewhere you can find it easily later on. You'll use it to secure your bow once you're finished making it. If you don't have floral wire, use a pipe cleaner.\n2. Take your ribbon and make a twist at the end of it. Use at least 2 feet (0.61 m) of ribbon for this bow. Twist the end, leaving about 6 inches (15 cm) of fabric for one of your tail ends. If you're using ribbon that isn't patterned on both sides, just make sure that the patterned or colored side is on the outside of the twist.\n3. Make multiple loops, twisting the fabric at the end of each loop. Hold the forming bow in your non-dominant hand and use your dominant hand to make the loops and twists. How large you make the loops depends on how big you want the bow to be\u2014use smaller loops for a more concentrated bow, and use bigger loops for a larger, fluffier bow. For this bow, you won't be making a figure-eight pattern. Instead, you'll just be making each loop consecutively right next to one another.\n4. Stop making loops on an even number. Make anywhere from 6-10 loops (or more, if you're going for a really large bow!) before you stop. The even number helps create symmetry in your bow.\n5. Cut off your bow from the rest of the ribbon. Cut the ribbon so that there are roughly equal-sized tails on each side. If you're worried about matching the sides, just leave extra room so you can trim the ribbon tails to match later on. It's okay if the edge is a little jagged\u2014you can tidy it up later on.\n6. Thread your floral wire through the center of the bow. Position the wire so that half of the loops are on one side and the rest are on the other. Twist off the floral wire several times so that it stays firmly in place. If you're using a pipe cleaner, follow the same process. You can leave the excess floral wire in place and use it to attach the bow to the wreath later on.\n7. Spread out the loops to create a fluffy bow! Position the loops in all directions so that it looks full. Because this bow is made of unwired fabric, it might look a little loose, but that's part of the beauty of it! If you want, you can also cut small triangles out of the ends of the tails for an added flourish.\n\n\n## Craft a rustic bow with burlap\n\n1. Cut off 3 separate sections of burlap ribbon. Make one piece 60 inches (150 cm), one 24 inches (61 cm), and the last one 8 inches (20 cm). Additionally, cut the 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap in half lengthwise. These measurements will create a large, rustic bow that will hang down off of your wreath.\n2. Hold the large ribbon in the center, and fold the sides down and across. Leave about 16 inches (41 cm) of fabric in the center before making your folds, as this will be the main part of your bow. Fold each side down and across so that the end of each one is on the opposite side. It's usually easier if you do this at a workstation so you can lay the ribbon down flat.\n3. Fold the 24 in (61 cm) piece of ribbon so the ends meet in the middle. Place the folded ribbon, seam-side down, over top of and in the middle of the 16 in (41 cm) section from the largest ribbon, layering one on top of the other. This second piece of fabric helps create depth in your bow by giving it a second dimension, rather than just having a flat, single-layer bow.\n4. Gather the fabric in the middle of your ribbons to make a bow shape. Pinch the fabric together in the very middle to create the 2 sides of your bow, and hold the fabric together using your non-dominant hand. One side of the bow should be a mirror reflection of the other side.\n5. Wrap your floral wire around the center of the bow. Thread it around the middle, and twist it off several times to ensure it's secure and won't come undone. If you don't have floral wire, you could also use a pipe cleaner. You can either trim off the excess ends of the wire, or let them stick out to the sides so you can use them to attach the bow to the wreath later on.\n6. Cover the floral wire with the halved 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap. Wrap it around several times until there isn't any excess ribbon to be wrapped around. If you want, you could also take the other half of that 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap and wrap it around the middle, too. A fun variation here is to use a colored or patterned ribbon to cover the floral wire for a little pop of color!\n7. Use your glue gun to secure the burlap on the backside. Flip your bow over and apply some hot glue to the burlap that's covering the floral wire. Use your scissors to trim off any burlap that is still sticking up. Let the hot glue dry before you flip it back over so it doesn't accidentally get stuck to your table. If you don't have a hot glue gun, you could use double-sided tape.\n8. Cut out triangles from the ends of the \u201ctails\u201d for an added flourish. Instead of leaving the ends of your burlap as straight edges, cut out a triangle shape from each end for a rustic and authentic feel. It's okay if the triangles don't match exactly, but try to keep them about the same general size.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A DIY enthusiast or a crafter who enjoys creating handmade decorations for various occasions, such as weddings, holidays, or home decor.

{"conversations": ["How to make a paper mosaic?", "Mosaics were traditionally made with bits of tile or glass, but it is possible to make simple ones using paper. They are a great project for school children to do while learning about different cultures throughout history. They are also a great project to do on a rainy day or over summer vacation. You can make paper mosaic masterpieces to frame and hang. You can also make paper mosaic masks to wear!\n\n## Make a simple paper mosaic\n\n1. Get some sheets of paper in different colors. Construction paper is the most popular, but you can also use scrapbook paper, paint chips, magazine pages, or even cereal boxes! What colors you need depends on your design. You don't have to use all of the colors of the rainbow. You could just use different shades of the same color, such as: light blue, medium blue, and dark blue.\n2. Cut the paper into small pieces to make your tiles. The pieces should be small, about the size of your thumbnail. You can make squares, rectangles, triangles, or even thin strips. The pieces don't have to be the same size. In fact, try to cut some smaller ones too. This way, you can fit them into tight corners. Sort your shapes by color and put them into small piles or cups. This will make it easier to find the color you need.\n3. Start gluing the pieces of paper to the outline of a shape. Lightly draw a simple shape on a sheet of paper, which will be the outline for your mosaic. When you start gluing the pieces on it, leave a small gap between each one. You can apply the glue directly to the sheet of paper, or you can apply it to the back of your tile instead. If you are using irregular shapes, including triangles, make sure that the straightest edge is on the outside of the outline\u2014otherwise, your shape will look jagged. If you are using white school glue, apply it with a paintbrush. This will keep things less messy. If you are applying the glue directly to the paper, work only in small sections at a time, or the glue will dry too fast.\n4. Glue the rest of your tiles to the inside of your shape. If your shape has designs on the inside, like spots on a butterfly wing, outline those designs first with more tiles before filling them in. Don't be afraid to cut some pieces down to help them fit! For a more professional touch, continue aligning the pieces along the outline, going smaller and smaller with each row until you reach the center.\n5. Consider filling in the background, if desired, using a contrasting color. This will make your work stand out. If you used different colors for your shape (this includes different shades of the same color), consider using just one color for the background. This will make your shape the focus. You can also leave the background blank.\n6. Set the mosaic out to dry. If you'd like to make your mosaic last longer, coat it with an acrylic sealer or a brush-on decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Let it dry before moving on.\n7. Finished.\n\n\n## Make a paper mosaic mask\n\n1. Draw a large oval or rectangle on a sheet of black paper. The shape needs to be just a little bit larger than your head. Don't cut anything out yet. Use poster paper, construction paper, or cardstock for this.\n2. Draw some shapes for the eyes, nose, and mouth. You will be cutting the eyes out, so figure out where your eyes will be when you put the mask on, and place them accordingly. Keep the nose and moth simple; you will be filling them in with tiles. A triangle for the nose and a rectangle or sausage shape for the mouth would be perfect!\n3. Cut some colored paper into small tiles. You can use construction paper, scrapbook paper, or paint chips for this. The shapes can be squares, rectangles, triangles, or even a combination of all three. They can be different sizes, but try to make them no larger than your thumbnail. You will need at least two different colors for this: one color for the mask and a contrasting color for the nose and mouth. For a different look, paint your own paper, let it dry, then cut it out. Sort your shapes by color. This will make it easier to find the color you need.\n4. Start gluing your paper tiles to the edge of your mask. Leave a small gap between each tile, and make sure that it doesn't go past the edges of the paper shape. You can use a glue stick or white school glue. If you are using white school glue, apply it using a paint brush. This will make things less messy.\n5. Glue some more tiles to the inside edges of the nose and mouth. This way, your nose and mouth won't be too big. Remember to leave a slight gap between each tile. For a cleaner finish, align any straight edges with the outline, and keep pointy edges on the inside of the shape. Use your contrasting color(s) for this. It will help them stand out better.\n6. Outline the outside of the eyes with more tiles, if desired. Don't fill the eyes in. You will be cutting them out later. You can use the same color you will use for the inside of the mask, or you can use a contrasting color.\n7. Start filling in your mask with tiles. You can glue them down randomly, or you can follow the curves of the outlines as you work your way towards the center. Remember to leave slight gaps between each tile. Use your contrasting color for the nose and mouth.\n8. Let your mask dry. If you'd like to make your mask last longer, you can seal it with a clear, acrylic sealer or a brush-on decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Remember to let the mask dry after sealing it.\n9. Cut the mask and the eyes out. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you cut the eyes out. You can cut the mask itself out using a pair of scissors, but you will need a shape craft knife (such as an Xacto knife) to cut the eyes out.\n10. Punch some holes to either side of the mask, and thread some ribbon or elastic through them. The holes should be at about ear level, or just where the eyes are on your mask. This will make the mask more comfortable to wear.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally conscious individual who is passionate about sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint.

{"conversations": ["Why did people start using CO2 (instead of e.g. oxygen) for carbonated drinks?", "CO2 tastes good! Carbonated water is actually a weak carbonic acid solution; this is what you taste. It's like \"salt and pepper\", but for water.\n\nSlightly acidic water is usually popular, hence lemon juice is sometimes used to taint a jug of water in times when no carbonated water is available.\n\nCarbonated water releases CO2 bubbles for many minutes after pressure is released (dissolved carbonic acid reforming), which is an important presentation effect that other gases do not generally have.\n\nIn many countries the local water supply is slightly alkaline (due to limestone rock being very common), and this can leave a bad after-taste, and make food in your mouth taste soapy. The addition of weak acids to water helps with neutralising this effect.\n\nAround the world, some lucky towns have natural springs with effervescent water (carbonated water), and man-made carbonated water is just imitating this. In history people have often travelled great distances to try effervescent water, so its popularity is well recorded.\n\nNitrogen is used for water pressurisation in brewing and cooking as it leaves little or no taste, and generally does not form other chemical compounds. It's used mainly when bubbles are required, but not an acidic taste.\n\nOxygen is unsuitable for water pressurisation as very little can be dissolved at normal soda pressures, and it has no taste, but may readily form unwanted chemical compounds.\n\nIn the 18th century, Joseph Priestley was the first person to document this manufacturing discovery.

{"conversations": ["How to identify ticks?", "While tick bites are not often painful, they can lead to infections or even chronic illnesses like Lyme disease. If you're uncertain whether you're dealing with a tick infestation, check for defining features that distinguish a tick from other bugs. Some bugs that look like ticks are harmless, but ticks must be dealt with immediately to avoid illness or infection. Call an exterminator if you're still not sure for a professional opinion.\n\n## Check for distinctive tick feature\n\n1. Look for a round, ovular shape. Before a tick is engorged with blood, its body is shaped like an oval with 2 major segments. After a tick is engorged, its head will remain small but its body will grow round and plump.\n2. Check for bugs that are between \u20442 to 2 in (1.3 to 5.1 cm) long. How large a tick is when you find it depends on whether it has recently fed on blood. Before it has drunk any blood, a tick will be around the size of a pinhead. Immediately to several hours afterward, a tick will grow to around the size of a lima bean.\n3. Examine its exterior for a protective hard body. In most cases, ticks have a hard exoskeleton. These are called hard or \"authentic\" ticks and are usually what people are talking about when describing ticks. Soft ticks with a flexible exoskeleton exist but are only found in select areas. Soft ticks are found in the western United States and southwestern Canada.\n4. Check for a star-shaped design on its back. Lone star ticks have a white, star-shaped design on their exoskeletons. If a bug does not have this design, it still may be a tick. This pattern is just a defining feature of this tick species.\n5. Examine the bug for black legs. Black-legged ticks, as suggested by their name, have legs that are darker than their bodies. Like a lone star tick's black legs, this is a defining characteristic of black-legged ticks and may not be present on every tick.\n\n\n## Differentiate between tick and other bug\n\n1. Avoid mistaking bugs with wings or antennae for ticks. Ticks do not have wings, nor do they have antennae. If you have found a bug with either, it is not a tick. Research bugs with similar characteristics to ticks but with wings or antennae if your bug in question has these. Poplar weevils, which are commonly mistaken for ticks, have both wings and antennae.\n2. Count the number of legs to distinguish it from insects. Because ticks are a type of arachnid, like spiders and scorpions, they have 8 legs. If your bug has 6, it is an insect and therefore not a tick. If your bug has less than 6 or more than 8 legs, it is neither an insect nor arachnid but is, regardless, not a tick.\n3. Watch for bugs that feed on blood and do not travel in groups. Billbugs are the commonly mistaken for ticks because of their near-identical appearance. The way to distinguish between a tick and a billbug is to watch them. Billbugs swarm in groups, whereas ticks are usually alone. Ticks also feed on blood, whereas billbugs do not. As a general rule, billbugs do not hang around or on people and animals. Ticks often do.\n4. Look for bugs that burrow in the skin instead of resting on its surface. Both ticks and bed bugs hang around animals and humans. Their method of feeding off of people and animals, however, differs. Ticks burrow into the skin to drink a living creature's blood but bed bugs stay on the skin's surface. Make sure you know whether a bug is a tick or bed bug before removing it from your skin. Without proper precautions, you may remove a tick's body while its head remains lodged in your skin.\n\n\n## Identify tick bite\n\n1. Check for mild pain around the bite. Tick bites are not usually painful. If you experience sharp pain, you have not likely been bitten by a tick. Research your other symptoms to determine what insect or arachnid bit you and begin treatment. If a soft tick bites you, you might notice localized pain immediately after the tick drops off.\n2. Inspect the site for redness. Although tick bites are not painful, they can still set off your body's immune system. If the bite and the skin surrounding it looks reddish, it may be a tick bite. Keep in mind, however, that redness is a symptom of many bug bites.\n3. Watch for rash development in the days and weeks following your bite. While not often a symptom of tick bites, you may develop a rash if your tick bite becomes infected or if you contracted an illness from the tick bite. If a rash spreads from your tick bite to other parts of your body, call your doctor or visit an urgent care clinic. Some illnesses that ticks carry, like Lyme disease, can take months or years before symptoms develop.\n4. Look for a tick still attached to your body. Because tick bites usually do not hurt, the most common way to spot a tick bite is to see the tick burrowed in your skin. Compare the bug on your body to other insects before removing it so you can use a pair of tweezers or a credit card to safely get it out of your skin. If you are not careful, tick heads can remain lodged in your skin.\n5. Recognize tick bite symptoms that require immediate medical care. While most tick bites can be treated at home, you may need emergency care if you develop an infection or allergic reaction. Seek emergency medical help immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms:\n\t* Raised red bumps (hives) all over your body\n\t* Trouble breathing\n\t* Swelling of the mouth, lips, tongue, or throat\n\t* Lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual who is concerned about their health and outdoor activities, such as hikers, campers, or gardeners.

However, it will be harder for you than for a child:\n\n* You have to make a conscious decision to practice, whereas a child just does it because their parents told them to. This makes it easier to skip practice when you don't feel like it.\n* You probably have other responsibilities (work, family) that take up time and energy. A child usually has nothing but time and energy. This means you'll have to be more efficient in your practice, and cut out all non-essential activities.\n* You're starting from zero. A child can learn a piece of music in a few days that would take you months to learn. This means you have to be patient and accept that you'll be playing nursery rhymes for a while.\n\nOn the other hand, you have some advantages over a child:\n\n* You can understand more abstract concepts. This means you can learn more efficiently, and don't have to rely on muscle memory as much.\n* You have a greater capacity for focused concentration. A child's attention span is very short. This means you can get more done in a single practice session.\n* You have a better sense of dedication and perseverance. A child will give up the moment it becomes difficult. You, on the other hand, will stubbornly keep trying until you succeed.

{"conversations": ["How to become hot?", "Being hot is more than just a look\u2014it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you\u2019ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don\u2019t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today\u2019s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you\u2019re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you\u2019ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don\u2019t forget how much you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you\u2019ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don\u2019t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that\u2019s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don\u2019t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the \u201cperfect\u201d body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts \u2013 instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You\u2019ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There\u2019s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can\u2019t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you\u2019re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they\u2019re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men\u2019s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you\u2019d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate amount of skin. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it\u2019s not surprising when people can\u2019t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it\u2019s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It\u2019s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer\u2019s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body\u2019s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn\u2019t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren\u2019t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It\u2019s easy to start slumping forward when you\u2019re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they\u2019re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It\u2019s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It\u2019s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don\u2019t try so hard. Or at least look like you\u2019re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you\u2019re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It\u2019s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It\u2019s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you\u2019re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone\u2019s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don\u2019t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they\u2019re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental scientist, sustainability consultant, or eco-conscious individual with a keen interest in climate change mitigation strategies.

{"conversations": ["How to handle feeling out of place at work?", "Many people spend a large percentage of their lives at work. This can feel terrible if you are one of many people who feel detached and disengaged within the culture of their workplace. Workplace loneliness can impact your performance and engagement, so overcoming the feeling of not belonging is central to your success. Knowing how to connect with people at work is also an important professional skill that can help your career. Manage the feeling of being out of place at work by trying to figure out what caused it, making an effort to interact, and finding solutions for disengagement.\n\n## Address the feel\n\n1. Try to label what you're feeling. Ask yourself what is keeping you from belonging. Co-workers sometimes hang out with their own age group by default and maybe you're much older or younger. Perhaps you are a manager and feel excluded from your subordinates?Maybe everyone else has energy for the job, but you're dealing with burnout. There even may be varying levels of lifestyles, values, or interests separating you and your colleagues. Sit down with paper and a pen and try to list whatever reasons come to mind. After you make a tentative list, you can spend a few days observing yourself and your peers at work to see if your reasons are accurate.\n2. Change your internal dialogue. Sometimes, the biggest roadblock keeping you from connecting with people is in your own head. If you keep telling yourself you don't fit in, you won't. Your thought patterns can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy in which what you believe about yourself becomes true. If you're thinking you don't belong, you're awkward, or people won't like you, reframe your self-talk. Create a list of positive, realistic statements about your workplace connections, such as \u201cI have much to offer as a friend\u201d or \u201cI enjoy the culture of my workplace, so I am certain to find people with common interests.\u201d\n3. Consider any constructive criticism you have received. If your boss or a peer has recently expressed concern that you are not a team player, dominate conversations, or bring a toxic competitive vibe to the workplace, you may need to dial it back to feel like a part of the group. If you shrugged off their feedback without trying to make positive change, they may be excluding you on purpose. If this describes your circumstances, you have two options: you can stay the way you are and remain excluded or reflect on their feedback and find ways to improve. It's up to you, just know that if you choose to stay the same, you could be hurting your reputation and growth within your career.\n4. Get help. Your engagement at your job has a major influence on your career growth and life satisfaction. If you can't seem to identify what's keeping you from fitting in, you made need to seek out professional assistance. If you are struggling with self-esteem issues or social anxiety, you should see a mental health expert. If you are dissatisfied with your choice of work or feel like your workplace does not align with your values, it may help to see a career counselor. Look into leadership or self-help workshops to get help with specific areas of personal development. One good option for leadership and self-improvement training is called Landmark Education.\n\n\n## Attempt to interact\n\n1. Set a daily conversation quota. Not belonging doesn't feel good, so even if you don't make any major changes, it can still make you feel better to interact more often. Make a personal goal to have one or two conversations with a peer at work each day. Think of some conversation starters to make it easier. Increase your chances of conversing by hanging out with your co-workers more. If they eat in the break room, don't take your lunch at your desk or work-station. Join them. Then, listen to their discussion and participate when you have something of value to add. For example, your co-workers are discussing vacation plans and one of them mentions a trip to a specific location. If you have an interest in that place, you might say, \u201cThat sounds so exciting! What sorts of excursions are you planning during your visit?\u201d\n2. Focus on the other person, not on your own shyness. If you are shy or hesitant about chatting it up with your co-workers, follow this rule-of-thumb: don't dwell on how shy you feel, turn your attention completely to the other person. Act as if you are serving them in a way\u2014try to make them smile or laugh, get them talking about their own life. When you're worried about how you're coming off to others, you might over-analyze and end up ruining a perfectly decent interaction. Take a break from focusing on yourself and devote your attention to the other speaker. Make sure to ask open-ended questions to keep the other person talking. These are questions that invite elaboration and that don't have a simple yes or no answer. Be willing to share about yourself as well to keep the conversation going and to form a genuine connection.\n3. Don't turn down invitations. If you're notorious for responding with \u201cno\u201d each time your peers invite you to lunch or to after-work drinks, they'll quickly stop asking. No one wants to be rejected over and over again, so you may have inadvertently caused them to exclude you. When you catch them discussing plans, ask if you can tag along. Or, if someone directly invites you, try to say \u201cyes\u201d unless you absolutely cannot go. Practicing saying yes to invites can improve your work life and your personal life. Accept a set amount of invitations per week and invite people to do things as well.\n4. Ask a co-worker out for coffee or similar. If the group as a whole makes you self-conscious, target one particularly non-intimidating, friendly co-worker. Making just one social connection at work can help you feel less isolated. Plus, once this person gets to know you, they might encourage the others to do the same. Say something like, \u201cHey, Carla, I enjoyed our talk earlier. It's refreshing to talk to another newbie mom. Would you like to get coffee together one morning before work?\u201d\n5. Suggest to your boss the idea of workplace socials. If your workplace culture doesn't emphasize inclusion, you might not be the only one feeling left out. Make a recommendation to your superior to stimulate connectedness with group events. Plan a potluck lunch or dinner to celebrate a company victory. Start a baseball, cricket, soccer, netball or basketball team.\n6. Seek advice about purposeful exclusion. Maybe your co-workers seem to have a vendetta against you, overlooking you for social outings and never including you in workplace gift exchanges. If this is the case, you will have to carefully consider how you choose to move forward. The best thing to do is to talk with someone you trust at your workplace about what has been happening. It can also help to first share your worries with a trusted friend. You might say, \"I get the sense that I am the odd one out at work. They never include me. And they stop talking whenever I come around. What should I do?\" Even if you don't take your friend's advice, it can help to have some unbiased support.\n\n\n## Deal with disengagement\n\n1. Resist acting out to get attention. Studies show that when an employee feels excluded, they may engage in acting out behaviors to get noticed. Examples might include cutting co-workers out of projects, cheating, lying, or aggressively competing. If you are tempted to behave this way, think about the possible repercussions first. Acting out will only make you feel more excluded, and it could jeopardize your job too.\n2. Set an objective workplace goal. Chances are you could be disengaged from work because you no longer feel challenged. Simply because your job description doesn't entail any lofty accomplishments or goals doesn't mean you can't strive for them. Create your own personal goals to work towards. This could be just what you need to feel passionate about your work and reconnect with the group. For example, you might aim to get so many reports done by 5pm each day. Or, you might develop a track to move towards a promotion or transfer to a new company. Try to focus on what you can control and avoid trying to control things that are outside of your control.\n3. Reevaluate the job. If the work you do and the people you do it with leave you feeling lackluster, you could be in the wrong career. If you have to change the way you act, undermine your values, or fantasize about leaving your job each day, pay attention to these cues. The culture of your workplace is just as important to your satisfaction as the actual position and salary. It may be time to quit. Re-examine why you got onto this career path or took this job.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An individual who is experiencing feelings of discomfort or unease at their workplace due to factors such as cultural differences, lack of familiarity with work environment, or difficulty adapting to new work dynamics.

{"conversations": ["How to make a bow for a wreath?", "A big part of making a beautiful wreath is adding on a bow! Bows can be the perfect accents to holiday, seasonal, and everyday wreaths. You can make a fluffy bow with plenty of full loops, or you can use burlap to make a floppy bow for a look that's a little more rustic. Whatever you choose to do, it'll take minimal materials and a little bit of practice to make the perfect bow for your wreath!\n\n## Make a fluffy bow with wire ribbon\n\n1. Cut off a 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) piece of floral wire. Set it to the side somewhere it can be easily found later on. This is the wire you will use at the end to hold your entire bow together. If you don't have floral wire, you could also use a pipe cleaner.\n2. Unspool your wired ribbon, take one end, and make a small circle with it. For making a fluffy bow, use a minimum of 9 feet (2.7 m)\u2014the more ribbon, the fluffier the bow! Make a small circle, about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide, at one end of the ribbon. If you're at the store and aren't sure if the ribbon is wired or not, simply pinch a portion of it together\u2014if it keeps its shape, it's wired. Keep in mind as you work that you'll need to stop when you have about 12 inches (30 cm) of fabric remaining.\n3. Pinch the end of the circle together in your non-dominant hand. Where the end of the ribbon touches the rest of the ribbon, pinch that seam together and hold it between the fingers of your non-dominant hand. This leaves your dominant hand free to shape the rest of the bow. You're going to use your non-dominant hand to hold together the fabric the entire time you're making the bow.\n4. Create a figure-eight by making loops on either side of the circle. Make a loop on one side of the circle, pinch the fabric in the middle, and then make a loop on the other side of the circle to create the figure-eight image. Continue pinching together the fabric in the middle that meets at your fingers. When you look at the bow from the side, it'll look like the number \u201c8.\u201d\n5. Continue making progressively larger figure-eight loops. Make at least 5 or 6 layers of ribboned loops. If you are using a lot of fabric, you may even make closer to 9 or 10! Remember to keep gathering the material in the middle by pinching it between your fingers. At this stage, your loops will be layered rather than spread out and the bow might look a little strange, but don't worry! You're on the right path.\n6. Stop making loops when you have about 12 inches (30 cm) of fabric left. Take the end of the ribbon and place it between your fingers in your non-dominant hand, forming a large circle. 12 inches (30 cm) of ribbon will produce bow tails that are about 6 inches (15 cm) long each.\n7. Thread the piece of floral wire around the fabric you've been pinching. Cinch it tight and twist it several times to make sure it's secure. You can now release that bundle of fabric you've been holding on to! If you're using a pipe cleaner, follow the same process: thread it around the pinched fabric and twist it off to ensure it'll stay in place.\n8. Cut the middle of the last big loop you made to form the tails of the bow. Cut in the middle of the fabric and watch as the ends fall down, creating the tails of your bow. You could even cut small triangles out of each end to add an additional flourish to the design. If you want longer tails, leave more fabric at the end when you stop making your loops. If you want shorter tails, you can simply trim them to the length you want.\n9. Shape the ribbon by rearranging the loops. Spread out the loops until you create a large, fluffy, full-looking bow. Make sure to pull loops upwards and down, and do your best to leave no see-through spaces between the loops. The great thing about using wire ribbon is that you can reform the loops easily if they get bent out of shape.\n\n\n## Create a bow from unwire ribbon\n\n1. Cut off a 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) piece of floral wire. Leave this piece of wire off to the side somewhere you can find it easily later on. You'll use it to secure your bow once you're finished making it. If you don't have floral wire, use a pipe cleaner.\n2. Take your ribbon and make a twist at the end of it. Use at least 2 feet (0.61 m) of ribbon for this bow. Twist the end, leaving about 6 inches (15 cm) of fabric for one of your tail ends. If you're using ribbon that isn't patterned on both sides, just make sure that the patterned or colored side is on the outside of the twist.\n3. Make multiple loops, twisting the fabric at the end of each loop. Hold the forming bow in your non-dominant hand and use your dominant hand to make the loops and twists. How large you make the loops depends on how big you want the bow to be\u2014use smaller loops for a more concentrated bow, and use bigger loops for a larger, fluffier bow. For this bow, you won't be making a figure-eight pattern. Instead, you'll just be making each loop consecutively right next to one another.\n4. Stop making loops on an even number. Make anywhere from 6-10 loops (or more, if you're going for a really large bow!) before you stop. The even number helps create symmetry in your bow.\n5. Cut off your bow from the rest of the ribbon. Cut the ribbon so that there are roughly equal-sized tails on each side. If you're worried about matching the sides, just leave extra room so you can trim the ribbon tails to match later on. It's okay if the edge is a little jagged\u2014you can tidy it up later on.\n6. Thread your floral wire through the center of the bow. Position the wire so that half of the loops are on one side and the rest are on the other. Twist off the floral wire several times so that it stays firmly in place. If you're using a pipe cleaner, follow the same process. You can leave the excess floral wire in place and use it to attach the bow to the wreath later on.\n7. Spread out the loops to create a fluffy bow! Position the loops in all directions so that it looks full. Because this bow is made of unwired fabric, it might look a little loose, but that's part of the beauty of it! If you want, you can also cut small triangles out of the ends of the tails for an added flourish.\n\n\n## Craft a rustic bow with burlap\n\n1. Cut off 3 separate sections of burlap ribbon. Make one piece 60 inches (150 cm), one 24 inches (61 cm), and the last one 8 inches (20 cm). Additionally, cut the 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap in half lengthwise. These measurements will create a large, rustic bow that will hang down off of your wreath.\n2. Hold the large ribbon in the center, and fold the sides down and across. Leave about 16 inches (41 cm) of fabric in the center before making your folds, as this will be the main part of your bow. Fold each side down and across so that the end of each one is on the opposite side. It's usually easier if you do this at a workstation so you can lay the ribbon down flat.\n3. Fold the 24 in (61 cm) piece of ribbon so the ends meet in the middle. Place the folded ribbon, seam-side down, over top of and in the middle of the 16 in (41 cm) section from the largest ribbon, layering one on top of the other. This second piece of fabric helps create depth in your bow by giving it a second dimension, rather than just having a flat, single-layer bow.\n4. Gather the fabric in the middle of your ribbons to make a bow shape. Pinch the fabric together in the very middle to create the 2 sides of your bow, and hold the fabric together using your non-dominant hand. One side of the bow should be a mirror reflection of the other side.\n5. Wrap your floral wire around the center of the bow. Thread it around the middle, and twist it off several times to ensure it's secure and won't come undone. If you don't have floral wire, you could also use a pipe cleaner. You can either trim off the excess ends of the wire, or let them stick out to the sides so you can use them to attach the bow to the wreath later on.\n6. Cover the floral wire with the halved 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap. Wrap it around several times until there isn't any excess ribbon to be wrapped around. If you want, you could also take the other half of that 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap and wrap it around the middle, too. A fun variation here is to use a colored or patterned ribbon to cover the floral wire for a little pop of color!\n7. Use your glue gun to secure the burlap on the backside. Flip your bow over and apply some hot glue to the burlap that's covering the floral wire. Use your scissors to trim off any burlap that is still sticking up. Let the hot glue dry before you flip it back over so it doesn't accidentally get stuck to your table. If you don't have a hot glue gun, you could use double-sided tape.\n8. Cut out triangles from the ends of the \u201ctails\u201d for an added flourish. Instead of leaving the ends of your burlap as straight edges, cut out a triangle shape from each end for a rustic and authentic feel. It's okay if the triangles don't match exactly, but try to keep them about the same general size.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A DIY enthusiast or a crafter who enjoys creating handmade decorations for various occasions, such as weddings, holidays, or home decor.

It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries.

Among the more benevolent leaders was Hyperion, the Lord of Light. He was called upon for wisdom and discernment; mortals valued his insight and praised his control of the heavenly bodies.\nYet Hyperion had one great love: Theia, his consort. She was a Titaness of radiance, a mother goddess who shone like the sun on all who sought after her. The two Titans were very much in love, and their love gave vibrancy to the life around them. They were happy - for a time.\nThat time ended when the Gods declared war on the Titans, with Zeus at the forefront of battle.

Knowing the war would end in defeat, Hyperion left anyway, answering the call of his brother and king.\nBut before he left, Hyperion gave Theia a gift: a ring of radiant light to wear around her finger. He told her that the ring would tell her if he was safe; that the ring would glow with a silver light when he was in danger. Theia took it gratefully and bid her lover farewell. It was the last time she would see him.\nHyperion fell during the war and was banished with the other Titans to the pits of Tartarus. During the battle, Theia watched in helpless anguish as the ring shone brighter and brighter until it was nearly as luminous as the sun. In her despair, she removed the ring and prayed to the Mother Gaia that she would cause the ring to grow as large as her love for Hyperion.

{"conversations": ["How to identify ticks?", "While tick bites are not often painful, they can lead to infections or even chronic illnesses like Lyme disease. If you're uncertain whether you're dealing with a tick infestation, check for defining features that distinguish a tick from other bugs. Some bugs that look like ticks are harmless, but ticks must be dealt with immediately to avoid illness or infection. Call an exterminator if you're still not sure for a professional opinion.\n\n## Check for distinctive tick feature\n\n1. Look for a round, ovular shape. Before a tick is engorged with blood, its body is shaped like an oval with 2 major segments. After a tick is engorged, its head will remain small but its body will grow round and plump.\n2. Check for bugs that are between \u20442 to 2 in (1.3 to 5.1 cm) long. How large a tick is when you find it depends on whether it has recently fed on blood. Before it has drunk any blood, a tick will be around the size of a pinhead. Immediately to several hours afterward, a tick will grow to around the size of a lima bean.\n3. Examine its exterior for a protective hard body. In most cases, ticks have a hard exoskeleton. These are called hard or \"authentic\" ticks and are usually what people are talking about when describing ticks. Soft ticks with a flexible exoskeleton exist but are only found in select areas. Soft ticks are found in the western United States and southwestern Canada.\n4. Check for a star-shaped design on its back. Lone star ticks have a white, star-shaped design on their exoskeletons. If a bug does not have this design, it still may be a tick. This pattern is just a defining feature of this tick species.\n5. Examine the bug for black legs. Black-legged ticks, as suggested by their name, have legs that are darker than their bodies. Like a lone star tick's black legs, this is a defining characteristic of black-legged ticks and may not be present on every tick.\n\n\n## Differentiate between tick and other bug\n\n1. Avoid mistaking bugs with wings or antennae for ticks. Ticks do not have wings, nor do they have antennae. If you have found a bug with either, it is not a tick. Research bugs with similar characteristics to ticks but with wings or antennae if your bug in question has these. Poplar weevils, which are commonly mistaken for ticks, have both wings and antennae.\n2. Count the number of legs to distinguish it from insects. Because ticks are a type of arachnid, like spiders and scorpions, they have 8 legs. If your bug has 6, it is an insect and therefore not a tick. If your bug has less than 6 or more than 8 legs, it is neither an insect nor arachnid but is, regardless, not a tick.\n3. Watch for bugs that feed on blood and do not travel in groups. Billbugs are the commonly mistaken for ticks because of their near-identical appearance. The way to distinguish between a tick and a billbug is to watch them. Billbugs swarm in groups, whereas ticks are usually alone. Ticks also feed on blood, whereas billbugs do not. As a general rule, billbugs do not hang around or on people and animals. Ticks often do.\n4. Look for bugs that burrow in the skin instead of resting on its surface. Both ticks and bed bugs hang around animals and humans. Their method of feeding off of people and animals, however, differs. Ticks burrow into the skin to drink a living creature's blood but bed bugs stay on the skin's surface. Make sure you know whether a bug is a tick or bed bug before removing it from your skin. Without proper precautions, you may remove a tick's body while its head remains lodged in your skin.\n\n\n## Identify tick bite\n\n1. Check for mild pain around the bite. Tick bites are not usually painful. If you experience sharp pain, you have not likely been bitten by a tick. Research your other symptoms to determine what insect or arachnid bit you and begin treatment. If a soft tick bites you, you might notice localized pain immediately after the tick drops off.\n2. Inspect the site for redness. Although tick bites are not painful, they can still set off your body's immune system. If the bite and the skin surrounding it looks reddish, it may be a tick bite. Keep in mind, however, that redness is a symptom of many bug bites.\n3. Watch for rash development in the days and weeks following your bite. While not often a symptom of tick bites, you may develop a rash if your tick bite becomes infected or if you contracted an illness from the tick bite. If a rash spreads from your tick bite to other parts of your body, call your doctor or visit an urgent care clinic. Some illnesses that ticks carry, like Lyme disease, can take months or years before symptoms develop.\n4. Look for a tick still attached to your body. Because tick bites usually do not hurt, the most common way to spot a tick bite is to see the tick burrowed in your skin. Compare the bug on your body to other insects before removing it so you can use a pair of tweezers or a credit card to safely get it out of your skin. If you are not careful, tick heads can remain lodged in your skin.\n5. Recognize tick bite symptoms that require immediate medical care. While most tick bites can be treated at home, you may need emergency care if you develop an infection or allergic reaction. Seek emergency medical help immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms:\n\t* Raised red bumps (hives) all over your body\n\t* Trouble breathing\n\t* Swelling of the mouth, lips, tongue, or throat\n\t* Lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual who is concerned about their health and outdoor activities, such as hikers, campers, or gardeners.

{"conversations": ["Why isn't Sectumsempra an Unforgivable Curse?", "Not many people knew Sectumsempra - they'd need to know it exists to  ban it.\nSeverus Snape invented Sectumsempra while at Hogwarts, and wrote it down in his Potions book. He doesn't seem to have told many people about it, it's possible he didn't tell anyone at all.\n\n\u201cHarry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned \u2018For Enemies\u2019, that he had marked a few weeks previously.\u201d - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 24 (Sectumsempra)\n\nHis book was hidden away until Harry found it, and Harry didn't tell the rest of the wizarding world about it either. Severus himself was seen using Sectumsempra when the Order was moving seven Harrys, and Harry had used it a few times after he found it in Snape's old book. Lupin knows of it, since he described it as one of Snape's specialties.\nHowever, they are probably some of the only people who know it - it isn't widely known like the three Unforgivable Curses. No one else, either in the Death Eaters or the Order of the Phoenix, is ever said to use it.  It's likely that the Ministry didn't even know of it. Therefore, the Ministry wouldn't have even been able to make the decision to classify it as an Unforgivable Curse, since they would likely not have even known it existed.\nIf the Ministry knew about it, would it be classified as Unforgivable?\nThe reason it wasn't classified as an Unforgivable Curse is because the Ministry wouldn't have known about it - they would be unable to make any decision on something they don't know exists. That, by itself, doesn't say whether the Ministry would classify it as one if they knew about it.\nNot all potentially harmful spells are classified as Unforgivable Curses.\nIt's nowhere near guaranteed, though, that if the Ministry knew about Sectumsempra, that they'd classify it as an Unforgivable Curse. There are other spells that could clearly do harm. Just to give a few examples - Confringo, Flagrante, and the creation of Fiendfyre are all potentially harmful but not Unforgivable.\nIt's never mentioned why those three curses are classified as Unforgivable and others aren't, but it seems likely that it's because there are little to no uses for them that aren't evil. The punishment for using an Unforgivable Curse is a lifetime sentence in Azkaban, so only the worst curses, that are highly unlikely to ever have a non-Dark use, would be made Unforgivable.\n\n\u201cNow \u2026 those three curses \u2013 Avada Kedavra, Imperius and Cruciatus \u2013 are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban.\u201d - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 14 (The Unforgivable Curses)\n\nNow, would Sectumsempra fit the criteria for being made an Unforgivable Curse?\nProbably not - it cuts through things like a sword. It can be used for anything a sword, knife or other cutting tool can be used for. While using it on people might be considered Unforgivable, the spell itself is simply the act of cutting. There are many things a wizard might reasonably want to cut with no malicious intent; vegetables, rope, cloth, building materials. Because of this, it seems unlikely that even if the Ministry had known about it, it would be classified as an Unforgivable Curse.\nIn addition, there is a countercurse for Sectumsempra.\n\n\u201cPushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand and traced it over the deep wounds Harry\u2019s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy\u2019s face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting. - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 24 (Sectumsempra)\n\nWhile the wounds from Sectumsempra can't be healed by simple healing spells, they can in fact be healed by the countercurse.\nSo - Sectumsempra likely wouldn't be made Unforgivable if the Ministry knew it."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A dedicated Harry Potter fan, possibly a writer or researcher, who is intrigued by the magical world's rules and regulations, particularly the nature of the Unforgivable Curses.

Have not yet figured out how to script the 'curvy L' for Lagrangian and/or for Laplace Transforms.\nAs of now I am using the 'L' - which is not good! :-( \nAny help?\nUPDATE The 2 best solutions are;\n```\\usepackage{ amssymb }\n\\mathcal{L}\n```\nand\n```\\usepackage{ mathrsfs }\n\\mathscr{L}\n```\nI got my answers at, http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html ", "You have been told how to get a curved L. But here's some more general advice, which also applies in this situation: In cases such as this, always create your own shortcut macro, say\n```\\newcommand{\\Lagr}{\\mathcal{L}}\n```\n\nThis way, if you ever decide that that curly L is not quite the one you like, it is easy to switch. Also, even before you knew the answer to this question, you could have written\n```\\newcommand{\\Lagr}{L}\n```\nin your preamble. Then you could start/continue writing the document, use ordinary capital Ls where you want, and ```\\Lagr``` wherever you actually mean a Lagrangian, and then later changing the definition of ```\\Lagr``` to something appropriate. This way, you wouldn't have to manually search for each occurence of a capital L and decide if it's a Lagrangian or not. Clearly ```\\Lagr``` (or whatever you want to call this macro) is also easier to type than ```\\mathcal{L}```, and it makes the source code much more readable.\n\nAnother advantage, which is probably more subtle, since you're new to LaTeX, is that we can make the curvy L exactly the type of math we want. TeX distinguishes between ordinary letters, binary operators, binary relations, opening and closing parenthesis and so on; the spacing between two ordinary letters is not the same as the spacing between the ```a```, ```+```, and ```b``` in ```$a+b$```. So since the Lagrangian is a kind of operator, we could say\n```\\newcommand{\\Lagr}{\\mathop{\\mathcal{L}}}\n```\n\nBut in the case of operators, the package amsmath (which you are most likely using; if not, you should) provides a somewhat better mechanism:\n```\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Lagr}{\\mathcal{L}}\n```\n\nAnother (related) tip: Even if you are using the same notation for two different things, it is best to make a separate macro for each. In this case you might have\n```\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Lagr}{\\mathcal{L}}\n\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Lapl}{\\mathcal{L}}\n```\nThe reason is the same as in the ```L``` vs. ```\\Lagr``` case above: If you at some point decide that using ```\\mathcal{L}``` for both is a bad idea, you would have to find each occurence of ```\\Lagr``` and figure out if it is really a Laplacian.

{"conversations": ["Why don't toilets use saltwater?", "The main answer is logistical. Building a network of pipes to convey water to houses is a major effort, and most places where that's been done found it extremely expensive. Providing a second set of pipes to bring salt water to houses would probably cost about the same. Except that cities go to considerable lengths to put their water reservoirs above the city as far as possible so they don't have to use as much energy for pumping. The few cities with seawater above them pay a lot to pump water out.\nA minor secondary problem is that sewage treatment plants are fairly heavily biological. They grow things in the sewage to break it down. But most of those things won't grow in salt water. It's already a challenge keeping toxic chemicals out of the sewage. For this to work it might be necessary to add a second set of sewer pipes to carry the water away, and develop new methods of treating that salty sewage (the treated sewage couldn't be spread on farmland, for example).\nIt would be far simpler, cheaper and more reliable to simply buy everyone a composting toilet to replace each toilet they currently have. As a halfway measure, mandating more economical toilets would help, as would education campaigns like the  ones encouraging people not to flush at all when they urinate. Even with a sensible cistern that has a 2 litre &quot;half flush&quot;, that's two litres wasted every time someone pees.\nAdditionally, salt is not good for pipes.

This way it is impossible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL.\n\nYou basically have two options to achieve this:\n\n1. Using PDO (for any supported database driver):\n```\n$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');\n$stmt->execute([ 'name' => $name ]);\n\nforeach ($stmt as $row) {\n    // Do something with $row\n}\n```\n\n2. Using MySQLi (for MySQL):\nSince PHP 8.2+ we can make use of execute_query() which prepares, binds parameters, and executes SQL statement in one method:\n```\n$result = $dbConnection->execute_query('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?', [$name]);\n\nwhile ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    // Do something with $row\n}\n```\n\nUp to PHP8.1:\n```\n$stmt = $dbConnection->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?');\n$stmt->bind_param('s', $name); // 's' specifies the variable type => 'string'\n$stmt->execute();\n\n$result = $stmt->get_result();\nwhile ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    // Do something with $row\n}\n```\nIf you're connecting to a database other than MySQL, there is a driver-specific second option that you can refer to (for example, pg_prepare() and pg_execute() for PostgreSQL).

{"conversations": ["How to make a cat tree?", "Cats are natural climbers, and will happily crawl all over tall structures. A homemade cat tree will provide your kitty with hours of entertainment, and can be built at a fraction of the cost of cat trees available at a pet store. With some tools and dedication, you can make a customized cat tree based on your cat's personality!\n\n## Build a cat tree from wood and carpet\n\n1. Design your cat tree. Before purchasing materials or starting to build, you need a design plan, which you can sketch out on a piece of paper to determine your materials shopping list. There are several things to consider when designing your cat tree. First, consider your space limitations. Determine where your cat tree will be placed, and what size will fit well into that space. It's a good idea to take measurements to ensure your finished product will fit the space. You should also consider your cat's personality. If your cat likes to climb, consider building a tall cat tree with several perches. If your cat would like a private place to hide or sleep, consider building in a covered sleeping nook. Finally, you should keep your carpentry skills in mind. If you are relatively inexperienced with building things and using tools, keep your design simple so that you aren't overwhelmed. If you're at a loss for where to begin, there are several websites that have pictures of do-it-yourself cat trees you can use for inspiration, or even patterns for cat trees other people have made.\n2. Buy your materials. Use your design plan to determine which materials you will need. Plywood works well for horizontal platforms; dimensional lumber and cardboard or PVC pipe work well for vertical supports, and carpet is ideal for covering the wood. You may also need the following tools to assemble your tree:\n\t* A drill and some wood screws\n\t* An electric stapler\n\t* A table saw and a handsaw\n\t* A Hammer and nails\n\t* A carpet or utility knife\n\t* Wood glue or another powerful adhesive\n\t* If you want to create covered areas for your cat to perch, you may also want to pick up a concrete form tube. These heavy-duty cardboard tubes make great perches and tunnels for cats. These can also be cut lengthwise using a utility knife to create concave platforms or open-topped beds for your cat.\n3. Cut all materials to size. Using your plan as a guide, cut all the plywood and lumber sections to size. A simple hand saw works well for cutting dimensional lumber, while a handheld circular saw or table saw is better for cutting sheets of plywood. Sand rough edges if desired.\n4. Build the base of your cat tree. The tree needs a sturdy base, which should extend farther out from the center than any other platform or component of the tree in order to prevent tipping. To make the base, a good option is to cut 2 squares of plywood to size and glue them together for extra thickness. A 24\" (60 cm) square works well for a basic cat tree, but the taller your tree, the larger you'll want to make the base, to ensure it is sturdy.\n5. Cover the base in carpet. Before attaching any vertical supports, it's best to cover the base with carpet or a thick upholstery fabric. Cut the carpet to size, making it a few inches larger than the base on all sides. Then, wrap its edges over the edges of the plywood base, and staple it in place on the underside of the base with a staple gun. You may need to cut small notches in the carpet at the corners to make it fold neatly beneath the base.\n6. Attach the vertical supports to the base. The vertical supports that will hold up your platforms can be attached to the base with screws, nails, bolts or wood glue. Flip the base over so the carpeted side is face down. Then, drill holes through the underside of the base in the spots where you want the supports to be. Attach the supports by inserting screws or nails through the holes and driving them into the supports. You may want to cover the supports with carpet before attaching them, as this will be easier than doing it after they are already secured in place. To make your cat tree double as a scratching post, wrap one or more of the supports in sisal rope, securing each end with wire brads or staples, placed where they will be out view and won't be scratched by the cat. If you use staples, you may need to tap them down with a hammer to make sure they don't stick out too much.\n7. Attach the horizontal perches to the supports. The plywood perches can be attached using wood screws and/or gluing them to the tops of the vertical members. Wrap them in carpet or fabric after affixing them, so that the screws aren't visible through the carpet, and staple the carpet in place on the underside as you did with the base.\n8. Continue building according to your design. Continue to affix each component, referring back to your plan for measurements and placement. Adjustments to your design can be made as you go to account for stability issues, new ideas, or incorrect measurements.\n\n\n## Build a cat tree from a ladder\n\n1. Obtain a ladder. For this simple, unique cat tree, you'll need an old wooden ladder. Look around at garage sales, thrift furniture stores, and antique stores for one 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2 m) high. Choose an old-fashioned ladder that looks like an upside-down \"v\" with several steps on either side that are at matching levels. It's fine if the wood looks old, but make sure the foundation of the ladder isn't too rickety. You want to be certain your cat tree won't tip over and hurt your cat. Try to find a ladder that's around four feet tall. A very tall ladder my be less stable or too tall for your cat.\n2. Gather your supplies. The ladder is going to be the base of the tree, but you'll need to alter it a bit to make it more cat friendly. Gather these supplies:\n\t* A piece of plywood long and wide enough to rest on two rungs of the ladder at the same level. This will provide a platform for your cat. If you want more than one platform, you'll need more than one piece of plywood. A hammer and 2\" nails\n\t* Carpet\n\t* An electric staple gun\n\t* A piece of canvas, denim, or other sturdy fabric you can use to create a hammock between the two bottom rungs\n\t* A can of paint (optional)\n\t* A toy that hangs from a piece of rope or string\n\t* Sisal rope to wrap around the legs of the ladder\n3. Sand and paint your ladder and wood pieces. Use fine-grain sandpaper to sand down the ladder and remove any jagged edges or splinters. Do the same to the pieces of plywood you bought. Paint the ladder and plywood pieces with a coat or two of paint, if you're using it. Let the paint dry completely. Use your imagination when it comes time to paint. You could just paint the ladder to match your existing decor. But you could also paint it brown and green to make it look like a tree, or use stencils to make designs up and down the sides. Instead of painting the platforms, you can make them more comfortable for you cat by covering them in carpet, attaching it to to the platforms after nailing them into place. Use your staple gun and affix the carpet with staples in the perimeter and in the center. Make sure they don't stick up from the platform, tapping them down with a hammer if necessary.\n4. Nail the plywood platforms to the ladder. Position the first piece of plywood so that it is lined up across two ladder rungs of equal height. Use the hammer and four nails to nail the plywood into the wooden rungs, placing one nail in each corner of the plywood. Make sure the platforms are very secure when you're finished nailing them down. You may wish to use more nails, or substitute wood screws for a firmer hold. If you have a second piece of plywood to create another level, use the same procedure to nail it down.\n5. Install the hammock. Many cats enjoy sleeping in hammocks. If you'd like to add one to your cat tree, measure and cut your piece of cloth so that its four corners stretch between the four legs of the ladder. Nail or staple a corner of the fabric to the inside of each leg, making sure that the nails are all at the exact same height. Be sure the fabric you use for the hammock is thick enough to hold the weight of your cat. You can double the fabric or hem the edges before nailing it down to make it sturdier. Fabric that stretches a little is ideal for cat hammocks. Make sure nails or staples do not protrude in such a way that your cat could be scratched or cut. Tap your staples with hammer if necessary. Instead of a hammock, you can also use a carpeted concrete form tube, fastened to the ladder by attaching it to two 2X4 pieces of lumber secured to the base of the ladder with bolts, nails, or screws, between the legs. This will make your cat tree less portable, but also sturdier.\n6. Wrap the ladder legs in rope. If you want the cat tree to double as a scratching post, you can wrap the bottom of the ladder legs in strong, coarse rope. Cut the rope in four pieces. Use staples to secure the end of the first piece of rope to the inside of the base of one of the legs. Wrap the leg tightly with rope, tapping it down with a hammer if necessary. Secure the other end with a staple, making sure it is away from any areas the cat is most likely to scratch often. Repeat with the other four legs. If you want to, you can cover the legs entirely with rope, from top to bottom, using a new piece of rope between each rung of the ladder. This will allow your cat access to a scratchable surface nearly anywhere on its new cat tree.\n7. Finish up. Hang the toy you bought from the top of the ladder, somewhere the cat will be able to reach it, so as to entice your cat to come and play. Add any other finishing touches you want to make your cat tree unique and fun for your cat.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A creative and environmentally-conscious individual who enjoys crafting and upcycling household items.

{"conversations": ["Windows in its earliest days was simply a shell that ran on top of MS-DOS, which means that Windows 3.1 itself was actually just a standard MS-DOS application like any other.\nYet, MS-DOS is not a multitasking operating system, and at the same time, Windows applications were compiled native-code binaries that ran without any form of managed environment. So, how exactly was multitasking of Windows binaries achieved if Windows 3.1 was simply a regular old MS-DOS program itself? Are there any old technical documents still floating around that describe the early Windows architecture internally?", "For Win16 programs, Windows implemented co-operative multitasking. Its implementation was based upon the &quot;message loop&quot; architecture of every Windows program.\n\nThe duty of every program was to endlessly run in a loop in which a call to the ```GetMessage``` function was performed. This function call looks whether a message to this process is in the queue. If there is one, it is retrieved (```GetMessage```), optionally translated (```TranslateMessage```, done to convert keyboard shortcuts into menu actions) and finally, passed to the window procedure (```DispatchMessage```).\n\nIf there is no message available in the queue, Windows suspends the current task and gives the CPU to another task. This task will try to retrieve a message from its queue as well, yielding the CPU to another task if no message is present and so on.\n\nIf a program needed to perform background tasks while there were no pending messages in its queue, it would call ```PeekMessage``` instead of ```GetMessage```. This didn't make the task relinquish the CPU, as ```PeekMessage``` would immediately return to the caller task to inform it whether a message is available or not. This was used to time-multiplex message processing with another time-consuming task (think of a 3D program rendering but letting the user cancel that render by pressing a &quot;Cancel&quot; button).\n\nIf this time-consuming task was actually very time-consuming, a well-behaved program should call the ```Yield``` function from time to time, to relinquish the CPU and let other tasks run. A badly-behaved program could easily hog the CPU by not retrieving messages too often or by spending too much time in a window procedure function.\n\nThe situation was quite different for MS-DOS boxes. They ran using the V8086 mode of the 80386 (if Windows was running in enhanced mode). Windows-aware programs ran in the so-called System VM (Virtual Machine 1). DOS boxes ran from VM 2 upwards. DOS programs usually were badly-behaved programs, so Windows assigned each DOS box a different virtual machine. Virtual machines used pre-emptive multitasking in Windows 3.1, so each DOS box could run concurrently to others and to any Windows-aware program."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A computer programmer or software engineer with a focus on operating systems and system software.

{"conversations": ["How to save gift wrapping paper?", "We've all seen promotional material for having \"green\" (environmentally sound) events, conserving paper, and saving trees.  In this article we'll see several alternatives to one time usage of rolls of wrapping paper for gifts.\n\n## Reuse wrap paper\n\n1. Wrap the gift in such a way as to promote reuse: When selecting wrapping paper, select paper which is durable. When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.\n2. Unwrap the gift for reuse, too. When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper. Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.\n3. Share the paper with several guests. If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.\n\n\n## Use gift bag with a gift tag\n\n1. Purchase a nice gift bag (or reusable bag), rather than wrapping paper for each gift.\n2. Make and attach a large gift tag to the bottom of the bag covering the manufacturers name, etc. Include at least 12 rows on the tag. Write your name, email, occasion and date on the first row of the tag.\n3. Place gift item in bag and present to honoree as usual. After honoree removes the gift from the bag, they save the bag for the next occasion.\n4. When the honoree has an occasion to give a gift, they write their name, occasion and date on the first blank line on the tag.\n5. Repeat the re-use and gifting process 12 times.\n6. Have the twelfth person to receive the gift bag send an email to everyone listed on the tag with the bag's history. Assuming the bag remains in usable condition, they can then attach a new tag on top of the original tag and repeat the process.\n7. Keep the reuse and gifting chain going until the back is too worn to continue. Ultimately, recycle the bag.\n\n\n## Make a gift display rather than gift wrap\n\n1. Bring unwrapped gifts to the celebration.\n2. Place the gifts on a display table. Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.\n3. Prepare a one page log for the honoree. It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift. The honoree can then use this log to send Thank You notes. Only one sheet of paper is consumed for the entire event!\n4. When it is time to present the gifts, position the honoree behind the table along with the guests. Take photos of the covered table, uncover the table and photograph the table displaying the gifts. (Optionally, make a video of the table being uncovered.)\n\n\n## Gift wrap (blindfold) the honoree instead of the gift\n\n1. If your honoree is adventuresome, blindfold them with an attractive looking bandana or blindfold prior to displaying or presenting any gifts.\n2. Present each gift to the blindfolded honoree while the people giving the gift stand behind them.\n3. Have the honoree identify the gift by feeling of it. If you want to make the task more challenging have the honoree wear attractive looking gloves or mittens while doing this. Optionally, have the honoree guess who gave them the gift.\n4.

We don't hear about all the cases where everything is fine.

However, a few of the specific issues you mention are perhaps less likely to arise in mathematics, due to cultural and structural reasons.\n\n>\"my advisor has stopped funding me\"\n\nIn the US, at least, the main avenue of funding for math graduate students is through teaching assistantships, since math departments teach a large number of service courses. Faculty who have grants can sometimes offer their students a research assistantship instead, so that the student doesn't have to teach. But a student really isn't completely reliant on their advisor for funding. Moreover, there typically aren't major expenses for the research itself (no expensive equipment, etc), so as long as the student is getting paid, research can continue.\n(This is not necessarily the case in other countries.)\n\n>\"my advisor wants to be 1st author, when I did the majority of the work!\"\n\nThe general practice in mathematics is that all authors are listed alphabetically, and the concept of \"first authorship\" does not exist. As such, people don't bother to keep track of who did the \"majority\" of the work. Thus this particular issue doesn't arise in mathematics.\n\n>\"my advisor is stealing my ideas!\"\n\nWhile individual departments may vary, I think there's a general sense in mathematics that a joint paper \"counts\" about the same as a solo paper.

{"conversations": ["How to identify different types of forklifts?", "Whether you're new to forklifts, or an experienced operator, it is always important to know as much as you can about forklifts and their operation. It is equally important to be able to identify different forklifts, both by look and name. This is especially important when searching for forklift operating jobs, as it will allow you to know which type of forklift you will be operating and if you have the experience to do so.\n\n## Identify basic \"forklifts\" and jack\n\n1. Know what manual pallet jacks are. Although not usually considered a forklift, pallet jacks are some of the most common manual forms of pallet handling that people will come across in logistics industries. Manual pallet jacks are usually very simple in design; the handle lever is squeezed to lower the pallet jack forks for insertion into a pallet, and the handle lever is moved in the opposite direction to engage the hydraulics that allows the pallet to be raised by pumping the handle.\n2. Familiarize yourself with motorized pallet jacks. Motorized pallet jacks, on the other hand, are much more varied than manual pallet jacks. They are almost always powered by electric batteries. Some are walk-behind, some are ride-on, and some even require the operator to take a side stance to ride on/operate, which is considerably more difficult to learn. Motorized pallet jacks usually have extended pallet forks that are used to handle two pallets at a time for greater efficiency in large warehouse operations, such as order picking. However, single pallet handlers are more common in smaller warehouses, for greater maneuverability and ease of use.\n3. Learn to recognize walkie stackers. Walkie stackers, also known as pedestrian forklifts, are still usually not considered a true forklift. However, they very closely resemble a forklift with forks, a mast, backrest, etc. They are almost always operated with a walk-behind pedestrian operator. They are frequently used in retail, very small storerooms, small scale warehousing, etc.\n\n\n## Identify counterbalance forklifts\n\n1. Know what standard counterbalance forklifts are. Being the most iconic, recognized, and popular type of forklift, a standard counterbalance forklift is a forklift where the driver sits facing the forks, and the counterweight is everything behind the front wheels of the forklift.\n2. Consider how different standard counterbalance forklifts are powered. These forklifts can be powered by anything, from batteries, petrol (gasoline), diesel, LPG/propane gas bottles, and other forms of fuel, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, internal combustion forklifts (petrol, LPG, diesel, etc) are generally faster and have greater lifting capacities than electric/battery-powered forklifts. However, for health and safety reasons, combustion forklifts cannot be used in confined spaces (e.g. shipping containers, small warehouses, etc) due to the exhaust gasses produced when in operation.\n3. Be familiar with how many wheels standard counterbalance forklifts have. They can be either 4-wheeled or 3-wheeled; two wheels at the front and one at the back allows for greater maneuverability, at the expense of stability. This is why 4-wheeled forklifts are usually more common, as they generally still have more than enough maneuverability for most applications in small spaces.\n\n\n## Identify warehouse forklifts\n\n1. Get to know reach forklifts. Designed for usage for indoors and on flat surfaces, reach forklifts (also known as high-reach forklifts) are named for their ability to reach high racking. (up to 12 metres (39ft) or more!!!) Depending on the forklift manufacturer, the reaching mechanism may be a moving mast type, or a moving forks and carriage type. Reach forklifts generally have lifting capacities of 1 ton to 2.5 tons. Lifting capacities above 2.5 ton are generally very rare due to many factors such as narrow aisle space and keeping the forklift compact (a stronger forklift must be larger and therefore unable to operate in narrow aisles) and also generally due to most loads in warehousing to be put in aisle racking usually just do not weigh more than 1- 2 tons. Reach forklifts drive differently, compared to counterbalance forklifts because the operator sits (or stands, depending on the model) sideways on the forklift. Reach forklifts are designed for narrow warehouse aisle use; the operator is able to look forward or backward without the neck strain of having to turn around. This sideways operator position, alongside with reversed steering controls, makes reach forklifts considerably challenging for a new operator to learn.\n2. Know what double deep reach forklifts are. Double deep reach forklifts are very similar to reach forklifts. However, as the name suggests, they are able to retrieve/put away pallets that are stored in double deep racking, which are pallets that are stored one in front of each other in specially designed racks.\n3. Familiarize yourself with order picker forklifts. Although an order picker forklift is considered a type of forklift, it is not used for regular forklift operations. Order picker forklifts require the operator to wear a harness and stand while operating, as they are used for lifting pallets alongside with the operator up into the air. The operator then typically picks up individual units of a product to manually stack on a pallet to \"pick\" an warehouse order; this is opposed to regular order picking, where workers can only pick products from ground level. An order picker forklift can allow operators to pick products quickly and efficiently at any level in the air.\n4. Recognize the disadvantages of picker forklifts. The only main disadvantage of them is that they must be operated on flat ground, and they cannot be operated on slopes or uneven ground; they are top heavy, and this increases the risk of tip overs.\n\n\n## Identify big forklifts\n\n1. Know what a heavy duty forklift is. A heavy duty forklift is an umbrella term used to describe a counterbalance forklift with a high lifting capacity. Most standard counterbalance forklifts in warehouses and manufacturing plants will only have a lifting capacity of 1-3 tons, whereas heavy duty forklifts have a lifting capacity of 5 - 50+ tons!\n2. Understand how heavy duty forklifts operate. All heavy duty forklifts will require significant space to be able to maneuver around. The higher the lifting capacity the forklift has, the larger the rear end (counterweight) of the forklift will need to be. The vast majority of heavy duty forklifts will be powered by diesel fuel, though some lower end heavy duty forklifts (with lifting capacities up to 8-10 tons) may still be powered by LPG/propane gas bottles or petrol fuel.While It is generally very uncommon to encounter battery powered heavy duty forklifts, a few forklift companies have recently started to offer them up to the 20 ton range.\n3. Learn about container handling forklifts. Container handling forklifts generally come in two types: Laden and Unladen (i.e. for handling full or empty containers, respectively). Laden container handling forklifts are usually capable of stacking full shipping containers 4-5 high, with lifting capacities ranging from 35-50 tons. Unladen container handling forklifts are able to stack as high as 8 or 9 shipping containers high, but with a lifting capacity of only 7-10 tons (empty shipping containers generally only weigh 3-5 tons). For these reasons, an unladen container handling forklift cannot be used for handling laden shipping containers, as it will be extremely overloaded. (full shipping containers can weigh anywhere from 10-30 tons).\n4. Learn about reach stackers. Reach stackers are technically not forklifts at all; as they do not have a mast or forks to lift loads, instead, they operate with a heavy duty boom that extends from the rear to the front of the reach stacker, and they lift shipping containers using a container handling attachment. Reach stackers often are highly sophisticated machines with on-board computers and other technologies. Their load capacity usually ranges from 40-50 tons. However, due to the extending boom feature, overloading is still possible.\n\n\n## Identify specialist forklifts\n\n1. Learn about Articulated VNA Forklifts. Pictured here, Articulated VNA (Very Narrow Aisle) Forklifts are generally known as \"Bendi\" or \"Flexi\" Forklifts. Articulated Forklifts are special types of forklifts which are articulated from the front end (wheels, mast, and forks and carriage) so that they are able to perform both duties of a counterbalance forklift (loading trucks) and a reach forklift (retrieve/put away stock in narrow aisles). Another variation of the articulated forklift is the \"Turret truck\" also known as the \"Man-up forklift\", named so, as much like an order picker forklift, turret truck forklifts lift the operator high up in the air along with the forks. Much like \"bendi\" articulated forklifts, turret trucks allow for maximized warehouse storage space by greatly reducing the aisle widths - however unlike bendi forklifts, turret trucks cannot be operated outside, on slopes or on uneven ground, similar as order picking forklifts.\n2. Identify an all terrain forklift. Generally similar in operation to standard counterbalance forklifts, the main difference is All terrain forklifts usually have large trodden tires, for use on all terrain ground, dirt, mud, grass, etc, where regular solid forklift tires would simply not operate on the ground - they would have no traction and get \"bogged\". All terrain forklifts are generally best identified by the large trodden tires and a similar appearance to a small tractor.\n3. Learn about side loaders. A side loader, or multi-directional forklift, is a specialist type of forklift used mainly for the moving of long shaped loads, such as timber, piping, etc. Its main feature is it is able to be driven in different directions; for example, it can be driven sideways after retrieving a long load from an aisle - which greatly eases the process of getting long loads in and out of racking storage - as opposed to turning a full 90 degrees with standard forklifts, a maneuvering problem exacerbated by long shaped loads.\n4. Learn about telehandler forklifts. Similar in design to reach stackers, telehandler forklifts are a specialist type of forklift common in the construction industry, the use of a boom with the forks and carriage on the end allows the handling of loads to places standard mast type forklifts cannot reach, for example on a rooftop, in the middle of a large trailer, etc. Again with the boom extension care needs to be taken as lifting capacity can be significantly reduced.\n5. Understand truck mounted forklifts. Truck mounted forklifts, also known as \"donkey forklifts\", are just as their name suggests. They are a small type of forklift that can be easily mounted on the back of a truck for transport, and easily taken off for use of loading or unloading the trucks on-site. These forklifts are generally built to be lightweight and very simple to operate, thus lifting capacities and lift heights are generally very low. Essentially they are used for lifting small loads on and off trucks, unless they are otherwise specially designed to perform other functions.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual with an interest in renewable energy and home sustainability.

{"conversations": ["How to change a diaper?", "Changing diapers is often a source of dread, fear, and humor for new parents and caregivers. Babies and toddlers who are not potty trained need to have their diapers changed every few hours to avoid rashes and discomfort. Create a diaper changing station so you can easily change disposable or cloth diapers at a moment's notice.\n\n## Remove the diaper and clean the baby\n\n1. Wash your hands. Before you change the diaper, wash your hands with soapy water. If you don't have access to a sink, you can rub hand sanitizer on your hands. If you don't have hand sanitizer, you can rub a clean baby wipe on your hands. If you work in a daycare, put on disposable gloves after washing your hands.\n2. Prepare the clean diaper. Place the baby on the changing surface and get out a new diaper. If you're using a disposable diaper, unfold it. If you're using a cloth diaper, fold it or stuff it with an absorbent insert depending on the style of diaper you have. Set the diaper to the side so it's ready once you've removed the dirty diaper. Many people place the clean diaper directly under the dirty diaper before you remove it, to catch any accidents that occur during changing. Just keep in mind, the clean diaper can get dirty, so you may need to use a second one if that happens.\n3. Unfasten and remove the dirty diaper. Pull away the tabs, snaps, or Velcro from the dirty diaper to unfasten it. Pull down the front part of the dirty diaper and gently lift the baby's legs up a little. If the diaper is wet, slide the back of the dirty diaper out from under the baby's bottom. If there is poop, use the front half of the dirty diaper to scoop as much of it off the baby as you can. Set the dirty diaper aside until you can fold it. Hold the baby\u2019s legs in one hand so that their bottom is in the air to avoid letting it touch the diapering surface. Ensure that you put the dirty diaper out of the baby's reach. If you\u2019re changing a baby boy who pees during diaper changes, consider laying a clean cloth or baby wipe over his penis while you change him.\n4. Wipe the baby's bottom with a wipe or a damp cloth. Take a baby wipe or damp cloth and wipe the baby's genitals from front to back (towards the bottom). Cleaning is important to prevent bacterial infections. To clean poop, you'll probably need several wipes to ensure the baby is clean. Gently lift your baby's legs by the ankles and wipe in between the baby's bottom. Ensure that there's no poop around the baby's genitals or along the creases of their thighs.\n5. Air dry the skin for a moment. You can prevent diaper rashes by keeping your baby's bottom clean and dry. Give the baby's bottom a few seconds to dry out before you put on the clean diaper. If your baby has a rash, apply diaper cream or petroleum jelly before you put the new diaper on. If you're using cloth diapers, you'll need to lay a disposable insert in the center of the diaper. The insert will keep the diaper cream from touching the cloth diaper which could damage it.\n\n\n## Put on the clean disposable diaper\n\n1. Lay the clean diaper under the baby. Grab the opened clean diaper and lay the back half of it underneath the baby. The diaper should be near the baby's waist. If you're changing a boy's diaper, point his penis down to direct any urine into the new diaper. Pull the front half of the clean diaper up onto the baby's stomach. Ensure that your baby doesn't bunch their legs or the diaper might be uncomfortable. Try to spread the baby's legs so the diaper will fit comfortably. If you're changing a newborn diaper, use a newborn diaper that leaves room for the umbilical cord stump. Or fold over the front of the diaper so you don't cover it.\n2. Fasten the diaper. Hold the front of the diaper in place with one hand. Use your other hand to pull the tabs on each side of the diaper and fold them up towards the front. Fasten them onto the diaper so the diaper is secured to the baby. Avoid fastening the diaper too tightly. Check to see if the diaper is too tight. If it is, the skin will look pinched or red. You should also ensure that the tabs aren't sticking to the baby's skin.\n3. Dress the baby and throw away the disposable diaper. Pull the onesie down and snap it closed or put the baby in a new outfit. Set the baby in a safe place while you fold the dirty disposable diaper. Throw it in the trash or in the odor-sealing canister. To fold the dirty diaper, fold the front part of the dirty diaper in half towards the back of the diaper to make a slight ball shape. Fasten both of the tabs in the center of the diaper to contain it.\n4. Wash your hands. If you are wearing gloves, remove and dispose of them. Then, wash your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap. Aim to scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Rinse them thoroughly, then dry them off.\n\n\n## Put on and handle cloth diapers\n\n1. Position the clean diaper under the baby. Take the prepared cloth diaper and lay the back half of it underneath your baby so it's near your baby's waist. If you're changing a boy's diaper, you can prevent leaks by pointing his penis down. Grab the front half of the diaper and pull it up onto the baby's stomach. Spread the baby's legs so the diaper won't bunch while you're fastening it. If you're changing a newborn diaper, ensure that you're using the smallest cloth diapers. You'll probably need to fold them specially so they don't rub against the umbilical cord stump.\n2. Secure the diaper. Hold the front of the diaper in place with one hand. Use your other hand to hook a T-shaped fastener or a two-pronged fastener onto the front of the diaper. Some cloth diapers use snaps that you simply snap into place or Velcro that you can just pull and press down on. Dress the baby before you handle the dirty cloth diaper. If you're using diaper pins, put a few of your fingers under the diaper and above the baby's skin to so you don't accidentally poke the baby.\n3. Store the dirty cloth diaper. If you're handling a poopy diaper, take it to the bathroom and dump as much of the poop into the toilet as possible. You can use a diaper sprayer to remove larger amounts of poop. Place the dirty diaper and any dirty cloth wipes into a diaper pail or hanging wet bag. Wash the cloth diapers according to the manufacturer's instructions. If you're changing a poopy diaper from an exclusively breastfed baby, you don't need to dump the poop in the diaper. It will dissolve in the washing machine.\n4. Clean your hands. Remove your gloves and throw them away, if applicable. Wash your hands using antibacterial soap and warm, running water for at least 20 seconds. After thoroughly rinsing your hands, dry them off.\n\n\n## Gather diaper supply\n\n1. Choose an area to change your baby's diaper. Set up 1-2 diaper changing spaces in easy-to-access spaces in your home. For example, you could set up a changing table in the nursery, your bedroom, or near a bathroom. If you don't want to use a changing table, you can easily change the baby's diaper on a comfortable flat surface (like a bed or on the floor). Choose convenient diaper changing areas based on where your family spends the most time. It's a good idea to pack a diaper bag or backpack with some diapering supplies. Keep the diaper bag in the changing area so you can stock it and then grab the bag when you need to leave the house.\n2. Organize the changing area. You might need more than just a diaper and some wipes to change the baby. Keep things organized and easy to find by using dividers, containers, and small baskets. This way you know right where something is if you need it quickly. For example, it will help to have a drawer or basket that has extra pajamas or pacifiers if your baby needs a change in the middle of the night.\n3. Stock up on diapers and wipes. Newborn babies can go through 8 to 10 diapers a day, so keep a lot of clean ones nearby. They should be easy to reach so you don't have to step away from your baby during the diaper change. You'll also need to keep wipes nearby to wipe your baby's bottom. If you're constantly refilling the diapers at your diaper changing station, consider leaving a new box of diapers in the same room. This way, you'll never be completely out.\n4. Store diaper cream or petroleum jelly. Babies frequently get rashes and you might need to apply diaper cream or petroleum jelly. Keep tubes of these at your diaper changing area so you can easily use them when you notice a rash. It's also a good idea to keep these in your diaper bag so you can treat your baby's rash when you're out together.\n5. Have a place to put soiled diapers. Decide how you'd like to dispose of or handle the soiled diapers. For example, if you're using disposable diapers, set up a trash can or odor-sealing canister. If you're using cloth diapers, you may want to set up a wet pail where you can store the diapers until you're ready to wash them. It's a good idea to keep hand sanitizer nearby to quickly clean your hands before you wash them in the bathroom. Remember to keep the hand sanitizer out of your baby's reach.\n6. Keep distractions nearby. As the baby gets older, you'll need to distract them during diaper changes. Distracting the baby with a toy, object, or book will also keep the baby from grabbing soiled diapers or squirming during the diaper change. Consider keeping some of these near your diaper changing station:\n\t* Small board books\n\t* Pacifiers\n\t* Toy keys\n\t* Rattles\n7. Store changes of clothing and extra sheets. If your baby has leaked through their diaper, you'll need to have a change of clothes close by. Keep several clean onesies at the changing area just in case. You should also have a few sets of clean crib sheets in case these get dirty. If your changing table has a soft, removable cover, you should also have an extra clean cover in case the baby gets the cover dirty during the diaper change.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A new parent or caregiver who is seeking clear, step-by-step guidance on diaper changing, especially for infants.

{"conversations": ["What are objective advantages or disadvantages of using the markup language LaTeX instead of a WYSIWYG word processor like MS Word or LibreOffice Writer?\nPlease use objective arguments.", "LaTeX is better at:\n\n* Dealing with mathematical notation. Layout and entry are generally easier using LaTeX than some other sort of equation editor. \n* Consistent handling of intra-document references and bibliography. As of a couple of years ago the major WYSIWYG editors still had problems with re-numbering cross-references and bibliography items. This is never a problem with BibTeX or LaTeX. \n* Separation of content and style. In principle this means that you can write your document without caring how it is formatted, and at the end of the day wrap it in the style-file provided by the journal publisher before submission to conform to the house style. In practice some of the journal publishers demand special formatting commands that partially moots this process. Furthermore recent versions of Word and LibreOffice Writer, when properly used, should be able to keep track of various levels of section heading separate from the body text, and apply uniform styling to each level. The gap is somewhat closing. \n* Tables and illustrations. With PSTricks or TikZ, one can produce high quality illustrations within the document (though the learning curve is a bit steep there). And I've found LaTeX to be better at preparing complex tables. \n\nWYSIWYG (especially Word and Writer) is better at:\n\n* Collaborative editing. Without using an online site for collaborative LaTeX editing (such as ShareLaTeX), working collaboratively on a LaTeX file ideally requires some sort of separate revision control software. Word and Writer have very good comments/annotations and edit-tracking features. When a large number of authors are commenting on the writing of one file, this can be very useful. \n* Spell check. Admittedly most text editors one uses to edit TeX files also do spell check. But this is generally conveniently built into WYSIWYG editors. \n* Compatibility. Unless you work in mathematics, computer science, or physics (and sometimes even if you work in those fields), it is more likely that your collaborators will know what to do with a Word or Writer file than a LaTeX file. \n* Minimum barrier to entry. If you just care about getting the ideas down on paper, you can use a WYSIWYG editor just like a typewriter. Sure, it may be tedious to fix the formatting later on, compared to LaTeX where one need to first figure out how to setup a bare-minimum file before using, it may be an attractive point. \n\nA wash:\n\n* Most journals provide templates for both Word and LaTeX, so there's no real winner there. \n\nSuggestion: if you want to convince someone to start using LaTeX, start them out first in one of the WYSIWYG environments designed for LaTeX first (for example LyX). This will help somewhat to ameliorate the scary entry barrier.

{"conversations": ["How to be a domestic goddess?", "Being a domestic goddess has distinct advantages, regardless of whether you live alone or serve as the matron of a big family. If you lack cleaning, cooking, and sewing skills, learning to master these tasks may seem intimidating. The key is to start small and avoid overwhelming yourself. With time and patience, you can polish your skills to goddess level.\n\n## Part one: chores and home maintenance\n\n1. Set a daily routine. There are a handful of chores you should do each day if you want to maintain a clean and clutter-free domestic heaven. Thankfully, these chores are quick enough to squeeze in even if you work a job outside of the home or have a houseful of kids to attend to. To reduce your stress as much as possible, plan on accomplishing each of these daily chores during a certain time of the day. Organizing your time may help you relieve some of the anxiety you feel about getting everything done. Daily tasks you'll need to make time for include making the bed, sorting the mail, and sweeping or vacuuming the floor. Other daily tasks should be performed as you go along. These include putting things away (to prevent clutter from developing), cleaning up as you cook, and wiping up fresh spills.\n2. Make a weekly schedule. Some chores only need to be done once or twice a week. Instead of rushing around to get these chores done all at once, plan on doing a little each day and set aside certain days for certain tasks. You'll likely feel more relaxed about getting things done, which means you'll do a better, more thorough job. Clean the bathrooms once a week. Make sure that you wash all bath linens and scrub all toilets, tubs, and sinks. Empty the trash, clean the mirrors, dust the lights, and wipe up the floor. The bedrooms in your home also need a thorough weekly cleaning. Put away anything that has been sitting out on a desk or side table. Clean all sheets, pillowcases, and blankets. Empty the trash, dust all the surfaces, and vacuum the floor. You may need to vacuum your living room, kitchen, and dining room every day or two, but other chores, like dusting, washing rugs/mats, and wiping mirrors, can be done once a week.\n3. Experiment with different cleaning products. Not every household cleaner is just as good as every other. Moreover, different types of cleaners may work better on different areas of your home. If there is some part of your usual cleaning routine that leaves a lot to be desired, figure out why your current cleaner is not doing the job right and research which options might be better. Compare chemical and organic products. Nowadays, many people prefer cleaning products made from natural ingredients instead of chemical cleaners. Natural cleaners have their own pros and cons, just as chemical cleaners have, but it doesn't hurt to include a few organic products among those you plan on testing out. Ask your friends for suggestions or do some research online about your different options. Test a few different products out on a trial basis. Pay close attention to which products work best with different materials\u2014wood, glass, ceramic, plastic, and so on.\n4. Be handy. The modern domestic goddess needs to know a bit more about the handy side of home care than earlier counterparts did. You don't need to know how to maintain all the systems and utilities in your home, but learning how to take care of a few basic projects is a wise move. At minimum, your home tool kit should contain a hammer and a few different screwdrivers. These tools will allow you to do simple tasks like hanging pictures and making small repairs to things like toys, cabinets, and drawers.\n5. Organize your realm. Clutter is the natural enemy of any domestic goddess. If you want to maintain a living space that any mortal would be envious of, you need to keep things orderly and in their place. Brush up on space-saving techniques and similar skills to keep your belongings in check. This is especially important if you're dealing with limited space. Get rid of any unnecessary junk first, then organize everything that has a purpose in a way that makes sense based on your needs.\n6. Master the laundry. Laundry is one chore that you will never be able to avoid if you want to be a domestic goddess. Your current laundry skills might be adequate, but you should still continue to watch out for aspects of your laundry routine that could stand to use improvement. Consider assigning different laundry tasks to different days, as well. For instance, you can clean bathroom towels on Tuesday, bed sheets and pillowcases on Wednesday, and any other miscellaneous towels or blankets on Thursday. Clothing will need to be cleaned throughout the week, though. Read the labels before you wash something and follow the laundering instructions provided. If you aren't sure whether or not an item will bleed color in the washing machine, test it by soaking a small spot and blotting that spot with a white cloth. Wash colors and whites separately. Also separate heavily soiled items and wash those on their own. Pretreat stains and presoak heavily soiled garments in a sink or bucket of water for 30 minutes before washing them. Use the recommended amount of detergent and select the best washer cycle for each individual load. Base water temperature and dryer settings on color and fabric type. Materials that can shrink should be washed in warm or cold water and air dried, for instance. Cold water is best for bright colors, while hot water works well for whites.\n7. Learn a few tricks. Once you've mastered the basics, keep an eye out for various tips and tricks that can take your home skills from \u201cgreat\u201d to \u201camazing.\u201d Some tricks work better than others, though, so you should test them out before bragging to your friends about your newfound knowledge. For instance, cover dirty stroller wheels and wagon wheels with plastic shower caps before bringing the item inside. Wrap pipe cleaners around the neck of condiment bottles to catch drips and prevent crusty build-up. Stuff holes in the wall and cabinets with steel wool to keep mice and other pests out.\n\n\n## Part two: in the kitchen\n\n1. Get off to an easy start. If you currently have some cooking and baking knowledge, then you're off to a good start already. If not, start small by making simple meals and following easy recipes. You can gradually build up your kitchen skills as you get more comfortable, but trying too much all at once is a good way to fail and get discouraged. Look for books specifically aimed at beginners or search for easy recipes online. Instructions that provide step-by-step pictures are often the easiest to follow along.\n2. Take a class. Look for free and cheap cooking classes in your area. Focus on developing skills that you're specifically interested in developing, and skip any class that will teach you something you already know or will teach you something you have no desire to learn. Local craft stores often offer classes on baking and food decorating. Small markets may have classes on cooking essentials. Check out cooking schools in your area. Even if you don't want to spend time and money on a cooking program, some of these schools offer one-time cooking courses at a discounted price.\n3. Find your niche. Not every domestic goddess needs to love cooking, but learning to enjoy it can motivate you into improving your skills. Try to find something about cooking or baking that you can feel passionate\u2014or at least interested\u2014about. Build up your cooking skills in general, but involve your point of interest as much as possible while doing so. Your passion might be something simple, like baking cookies or mastering stovetop cooking. On the other hand, you might find your attention grabbed by something a little more unique, like gluten-free baking or canning.\n4. Make any necessary adjustments. You might have a full set of cooking and baking skills when all is said and done, but that doesn't mean you will be able to show them all off each and every day. Know when to make a simple meal and when to whip up something more impressive. Learning how to use your cooking to improve and please those you're cooking for is another skill you will need to master. For example, if you're cooking for picky kids, focus on choosing kid-friendly meals instead of trying to impress them with an elaborate meal they won't even eat. When you're cooking for guests, find out about any food allergies or special diets ahead of time and plan your menu accordingly.\n5. Experiment. Once you feel comfortable enough in the kitchen, start using the skills and knowledge you have gained to experiment with your own recipes and tasty creations. Some experiments might be a success while others will likely be a failure. The important thing is simply to keep working at it until your successes vastly outnumber your failures.\n\n\n## Part three: sew and other \"lost\" skills\n\n1. Master the basics of sewing. Sewing is the queen of lost skills, so if you don't know even the most basic stitches, you really aren't alone. At minimum, though, you should know how to sew hems, repair small rips and tears, and attach buttons. Learn a variety of basic stitches, including the straight stitch, the back stitch, the zigzag stitch, and the basting stitch. Invest in a sewing machine. As your sewing skills improve, consider buying a sewing machine of your own. You will probably be glad that you did. Fixing garments and creating projects from scratch will both be much easier if you learn to machine sew as well as hand sew.\n2. Get crafty. Sewing is not the only lost skill worth learning, of course. There is a wide range of other crafts and domestic abilities you can explore. You do not need to master all of them, but picking one or two you'd like to become great at can improve your standing as a domestic goddess. Potential areas of interest could include gardening, crocheting, or knitting. You could also check out community craft websites, like Pinterest, to get more ideas.\n3. Take classes. You can learn a lot by teaching yourself, but sometimes, the best way to learn a new skill or to advance an old one is to take an actual class on it. Look for cheap classes in your area or sign up for a class online.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally conscious individual who is passionate about sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint.

{"conversations": ["How to be happy in an unhappy marriage?", "People remain in unhappy marriages for many reasons. If you're one of those people, you may feel like you can't be happy. Nonetheless, you can find your own way to happiness, even in a bad situation, by practicing habits that lead to happiness, and you may even be able to work on your marriage to move toward happiness as a couple.\n\n## Learn to be happy\n\n1. Find ways to be grateful. It's not always easy to be grateful, especially in the midst of a bad relationship. Nonetheless, gratitude can help you cope with the bad relationship, and it can lead to you being happier. Take time each day to figure out what you are thankful for. Try writing a few things you are grateful for each day in a journal. You can also use posts on social media for this purpose. Usually, even if the situation is bad, you can find something to be grateful about. For instance, you may not like how you are being treated in the relationship you are in, but you may be grateful to have financial stability in your life at the moment. Alternatively, maybe you're grateful that the other person in the relationship remains a good parent to your kids.\n2. Engage in flow experiences. Flow moments are when you lose yourself to an experience by being completely absorbed in whatever it is you're doing. If you're an artist, a writer, or even a runner, you may already understand this type of experience. It's that moment when the world falls away, and you are just experiencing or enjoying what you're doing. Studies have shown that the more flow moments you have, the happier you are in general. Choose an activity that challenges you a little bit, but that is still familiar so that you can lose yourself in it. For example, if you enjoy painting landscapes, then you might try painting a new subject such as a portrait or a basket of fruit.\n3. Stop fighting the same fights. That is, if you always find yourself arguing about the same things, it may be time to put that topic aside. You need to decide that you won't discuss it because you can't agree or try to find a compromise that works for both of you. For example, if you tend to fight over politics, then you might want to make politics an off-limits topic. Or, if you often fight about what movie you are going to watch on Friday nights, then you might want to take turns choosing the movie.\n4. Develop your own interests. If your marriage is not what you want it to be, it may be time to find some fulfillment outside of your marriage and not in the form of an affair. Having your own hobbies and interests will help you stay independent and keep you happy and engaged with the world. In fact, developing your own interests is a good idea even if you have a great marriage. Consider exploring interests at the library, joining local hobby clubs or cookery classes, or taking a vocational class at a nearby community college.\n5. Try volunteering. Having a sense of purpose and some good social connections with other people is also a good way to feel happy. Volunteering can give you a sense of purpose in life and it also allows you to interact with other like-minded people, it might help you to feel happier. Try to find an organization that you would like to contribute to, such as an animal shelter or a food bank, and apply to become a volunteer. You might even ask your spouse if he or she would like to volunteer with you and it might be a good bonding activity for the two of you.\n6. Develop your social life. Many studies point to relationships being key to happiness. If your main relationship is unhappy, then you may not see how you can change your situation. Your spouse doesn't have to be your main source of social interactions. You can have fulfilling relationships with friends, as well as other members of your family. Try to go out to dinner with friends one night per week or get together with a sibling or cousin for a day of shopping or a activity session such as tennis or swimming. If you don't have a lot of friends, then try to meet more people who share your interests. For example, you could join a bowling league, take an art class, or find a choir or band who need new members.\n\n\n## Work towards a better marriage\n\n1. Take time to be together. Making time for each other is a way to say you are committed to each other. Say you will spend a certain time each week with each other, and stick to it. It will also give you a chance to get to know one another again.\n2. Remember what you valued. When you first got together, you were probably partially attracted by the differences the other person exhibited. For instance, maybe you were exhilarated by the fact that he or she was impulsive and loved to be spontaneous. Now, you may find yourself hating the quality. The key is to try to remember why you loved that quality in the first place and move toward enjoying it again. For instance, it may drive you crazy when your spouse wants to drop everything and drive to the mountains. On the other hand, it keeps your life from getting too boring. Try to strike a balance, and enjoy what you can.\n3. Talk about strengths and difficulties. It is important to acknowledge what is going well in your relationship as well as what has become a struggle. You might even want to make a list of strengths and difficulties together. Make sure that you include things on the list that you avoid talking about because of fears that you will just end up fighting about them. Try to pick a time to talk about your strengths and difficulties when you are both feeling calm and focused. Avoid talking at the end of a long day or at other stressful times. Use \"I\" statements rather than \"You\" statements. In other words, try to talk about what you're feeling and what you think is wrong without blaming the other person. For instance, saying \"I get upset when we don't spend enough time together\" is better than \"You're never around.\" The second statement puts your spouse on guard, while the first helps open discussion. Spend time talking and listening. That is, you can't just lay out what you think is wrong. You also need to spend time actively listening to what your spouse has to say. Show you're engaged by offering short summaries of what he or she has said and by asking questions that are relevant to the conversation.\n4. Work out solutions. Once you've figured out together what issues you have in the marriage, it's time to try to come up with some solutions. You may even be able to draw on some of your strengths to help you develop solutions to problems in your relationships. To compromise, you must talk about your wants and needs, helping you both to decide what's most important to each of you. In other words, to make a compromise, you must be willing to let the other person win when it comes to their needs, giving ground when it comes in conflict with your wants. The same must be true of the other person.\n5. Think about counseling. Sometimes, you need the help of a professional to get past your problems. A marriage counselor may help you fix more problems than you expect, and in fact, about half of people who use marriage counselors say that the counselor helped them fix all of the major problems in their marriage.\n\n\n## Consider the alternative\n\n1. Try legal separation. A legal separation gives you the time away from your spouse that you may need to work out problems. It is different than a divorce because you remain married. The benefit of a separation is it gives you a legal way to work out custody and child support while you are living apart, as well as how your property should be divided up. Nonetheless, if you work out your problems, you can go back to a normal marriage.\n2. Know divorce may be a better option. While getting a divorce is a life upheaval, staying in an unhealthy marriage can be detrimental to self-esteem and mental health. Some studies have shown it's better to get out of a caustic relationship and work to improve your own mental health than to stay. Understand an unhappy marriage can lead to depression. One study, which involved data from 5,000 adults, showed that the quality of your most important relationship is a good predictor of developing depression. Meaning, if one of your closest relationships, including your spousal one, is in bad repair, it puts you at risk for developing depression.\n3. Consider reasons to divorce. You may find that you have a good reason for getting a divorce. If you are unhappy in your marriage, you will likely find that you are a happier person once you get out. You might consider a divorce if your spouse had an affair. While some couples overcome infidelity, others never recover from it. If you find that you can't forgive your spouse for what he or she did even after months or years, you may want to consider a divorce. You've grown in different ways. Sometimes, when you grow into full-fledged adults together, you take different directions. If you find you and your spouse can't agree on much of anything anymore because you are just too different, it may be best to divorce. Your partner is bad at finances and won't change. Of course, everyone makes bad money choices sometimes. However, if your partner is so bad that it is causing stress on your marriage or is bankrupting your family, you may need to get out of the marriage, especially if you've expressed concern but your spouse is unwilling to change. Think about the kids. Many unhappily married couples stay together for the kids. Divorce is hard on kids, but it's also true that being unhappily married can be hard on your kids, as well. Your kids know you're unhappy, and if you're constantly fighting, you're putting stress on them, anyway.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A person seeking advice or guidance on improving their marital relationship, possibly experiencing personal distress and seeking solutions to overcome challenges in their marriage.

{"conversations": ["How to kill a fly?", "Flies can be annoying pests, especially inside your home. If you can\u2019t remove the flies humanely, you may want to kill them. Use a flyswatter for an easy way to kill a few lone flies. Try using sprays to get rid of numerous flies. You can also kill flies with bait and traps, like fly tape, DIY traps, or Venus fly traps. Eliminating flies can be done quickly, easily, and cheaply, whether you have a single fly or dozens to remove.\n\n## Use a flyswatter\n\n1. Wait for the fly to land. Keep your eye on the fly until it lands, then get ready to make your move. Approach the fly silently and slowly so it doesn't fly away. If you don\u2019t have a flyswatter, you can use other objects with a flat surface, like a newspaper, shoe, or book.\n2. Swat the fly with a quick, downward motion. Raise your flyswatter above your head, and bring it down over the fly in a single, strong move. You are crushing the fly between your flyswatter and a hard surface. If you miss the fly the first time, wait for it to land and swat again.\n3. Wipe up the fly and clean off your flyswatter. Rinse the flyswatter in soap and water, and use a tissue or paper towel to wipe up the mess. Make sure to wash your hands! You can also disinfect with a cleaning solution to prevent spreading any germs.\n4. Try using an electric flyswatter for an easier, efficient option. Electric flyswatters are devices that lure in flies with a light and kill them upon contact. Stand near the fly with your electric flyswatter to kill it effortlessly and quickly. Be sure to read over instructions carefully before use. Avoid touching the racket area, and always let the flyswatter fully cool down before storing it.\n\n\n## Spray the fly\n\n1. Choose from either chemical sprays, household cleaners, or hairspray. Chemical sprays kill flies instantly upon contact, though they contain harsh chemicals. You can also spray the flies with household cleaners, like Windex or Formula 409, or with an aerosol like hairspray. All of these sprays will help you kill a fly. Purchase chemical fly sprays at home supply stores. Look for brands like Hot Shot and Raid. Use spray if you want to remove many flies very quickly. Chemical sprays will kill them the fastest, though they have harmful chemicals. Household cleaners are a cheaper alternative, and you likely have them at home already.\n2. Spray the air near the fly thoroughly. Spray the fly while it is in the air or when the fly lands. Hold in the trigger to release the spray, and spray directly into the air around the fly. You want to saturate the fly in the spray. If you are using chemical sprays, the fly will die instantly. If you are using household cleaners or hairspray, the spray will coat the fly's wings, making it impossible to fly. The fly will still die, just not as quickly as with chemicals.\n3. Leave the room after you spray any hazardous chemical. The chemicals contained in most fly sprays are toxic and lethal. Household cleaners also use chemicals, though not quite as toxic. Avoid inhaling these chemicals by leaving the room immediately after you spray. Leave the room for both chemical sprays and household cleaners. If you have pets or children, they should also avoid the room until the chemicals have settled. You can wait about an hour before reentering the room, so the chemicals can dissipate. This will depend on how ventilated your room is and how much chemical you spray. It is safe to come back into the room when you no longer smell the chemicals.\n4. Dispose of the dead fly and wash your hands. Scoop up the dead flies with a paper towel or tissue, and throw them in the trash can. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water! If you killed multiple flies, throw them all away before you wash your hands.\n\n\n## Remove fly with trap\n\n1. Hang fly paper in areas with many flies for a cheap and easy option. Fly papers, or fly ribbons, are strips of paper coated in a sticky attractant. Flies approach the paper because they are attracted to the smell, and they get stuck to the paper and die. You can hang fly paper near your entrances, above your windows, or next to your trash can, for example. Fly paper can be hung up indoors or outdoors. Replace your fly paper after you collect a handful of dead flies.\n2. Make your own trap for a cost effective solution. You can make your own trap with sugar water, a jar, and a paper cone. Cut a small hole around the point of the paper cone. Pour 1 part sugar and 2 parts water into the jar, and place the cone upside down inside the jar.

{"conversations": ["Given that Kohn-Sham DFT is strictly a ground-state method (at 0 K), how is it sufficient to describe materials in real-life applications?", "These are a few extra points to complement Andrew Rosen's comprehensive response:\n\n* To be absolutely clear, typical DFT calculations are not performed at 0K, a better description of what happens is that they are performed \"for a static crystal\". Static crystal means that the atoms are fixed at their crystallographic positions (which is what a typical DFT calculation does), but this situation is different from 0K. Even at 0K, the atomic nuclei move due to quantum zero-point motion (also called quantum fluctuations). This quantum zero-point motion is very small for compounds containing heavy elements, which means that in these cases \"0K\" and \"static crystal\" are almost the same and many people use the terms interchangeably. However, quantum zero-point motion can be very large for light elements, for example in solid hydrogen (the lightest of all compounds) it dominates even at room temperature. To perform a calculation at 0K (as opposed to a static crystal calculation), the strategy that Andrew Rosen proposed would still work if you use quantum statistics. For example, solving the vibrational problem within the harmonic approximation at the quantum mechanical level with give you the zero-point energy as the ground state of a quantum harmonic oscillator. A good reference for hydrogen is this review article.\n* Although Andrew Rosen is correct in that the potential energy surface is largely temperature independent, there are a few situations in which the potential energy surface does vary significantly with temperature. An example of this is provided by many perovskite crystals (e.g. $\\ce{BaTiO_3}$), which undergo a series of temperature-induced structural phase transitions. For example, at very high temperatures the structure is cubic, and this structure sits at a minimum of the potential free energy surface. However, if you calculated the potential energy surface (instead of the free energy surface), then it has a double-well shape and the cubic structure is at the saddle point, so the structure will lower its energy by distorting and going to one of the minima. This is precisely what happens at low temperatures because the corresponding free energy surface acquires a double-well shape, and the system undergoes a structural phase transition. A good early DFT reference for this is this paper.\n* As already pointed out by others, the differences between DFT and TDDFT or $GW$-BSE are not related to the inclusion or exclusion of temperature. In this language, both TDDFT and $GW$-BSE have no temperature for the behaviour of the nuclei, and you could incoporate it in a similar fashion to what Andrew Rosen described for DFT.\n"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A researcher or a graduate student in the field of computational physics or materials science.

Also after generating those points, what is the best way to visualize and check whether they are truly uniform on the surface $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$?", "A standard method is to generate three standard normals and construct a unit vector from them. That is, when $X_i \\sim N(0,1)$ and $\\lambda^2 = X_1^2 + X_2^2 + X_3^2$, then $(X_1/\\lambda, X_2/\\lambda, X_3/\\lambda)$ is uniformly distributed on the sphere.  This method works well for $d$-dimensional spheres, too.\nIn 3D you can use rejection sampling: draw $X_i$ from a uniform$[-1,1]$ distribution until the length of $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ is less than or equal to 1, then--just as with the preceding method--normalize the vector to unit length.  The expected number of trials per spherical point equals $2^3/(4 \\pi / 3)$ = 1.91.  In higher dimensions the expected number of trials gets so large this rapidly becomes impracticable.\nThere are many ways to check uniformity.  A neat way, although somewhat computationally intensive, is with Ripley's K function.  The expected number of points within (3D Euclidean) distance $\\rho$ of any location on the sphere is proportional to the area of the sphere within distance $\\rho$, which equals $\\pi\\rho^2$.

{"conversations": ["I've been writing C and C++ code for almost twenty years, but there's one aspect of these languages that I've never really understood. I've obviously used regular casts i.e.\n```MyClass *m = (MyClass *)ptr;\n```\nall over the place, but there seem to be two other types of casts, and I don't know the difference. What's the difference between the following lines of code?\n```MyClass *m = (MyClass *)ptr;\nMyClass *m = static_cast(ptr);\nMyClass *m = dynamic_cast(ptr);\n```", "## static_cast\n\n`static_cast` is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. `static_cast` performs no runtime checks. This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, and thus a check would be unnecessary. Here is an example:\n\n```\nvoid func(void *data) {\n  // Conversion from MyClass* -> void* is implicit\n  MyClass *c = static_cast<MyClass*>(data);\n  ...\n}\n\nint main() {\n  MyClass c;\n  start_thread(&func, &c)  // func(&c) will be called\n      .join();\n}\n```\nIn this example, you know that you passed a `MyClass` object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this.\n\n## dynamic_cast\n\n`dynamic_cast` is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a `bad_cast` exception is thrown in that case).\n\n```\nif (JumpStm *j = dynamic_cast<JumpStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n} else if (ExprStm *e = dynamic_cast<ExprStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n}\n```\nAn \"up-cast\" (cast to the base class) is always valid with both `static_cast` and `dynamic_cast`, and also without any cast, as an \"up-cast\" is an implicit conversion (assuming the base class is accessible, i.e. it's a `public` inheritance).\n\n## Regular Cast\n\nThese casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering `dynamic_cast`. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of `const_cast`, `static_cast` and `reinterpret_cast`, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use `dynamic_cast`.\n\nIn addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the \"equivalent\" `static_cast` sequence would give you a compile-time error for that.\n\nSome people prefer C-style casts because of their brevity.

{"conversations": ["I am 30 years old, is it too late to start learning piano now?", "It's never too late to learn the piano. However, it will be harder for you than for a child:\n\n* You have to make a conscious decision to practice, whereas a child just does it because their parents told them to. This makes it easier to skip practice when you don't feel like it.\n* You probably have other responsibilities (work, family) that take up time and energy. A child usually has nothing but time and energy. This means you'll have to be more efficient in your practice, and cut out all non-essential activities.\n* You're starting from zero. A child can learn a piece of music in a few days that would take you months to learn. This means you have to be patient and accept that you'll be playing nursery rhymes for a while.\n\nOn the other hand, you have some advantages over a child:\n\n* You can understand more abstract concepts. This means you can learn more efficiently, and don't have to rely on muscle memory as much.\n* You have a greater capacity for focused concentration. A child's attention span is very short. This means you can get more done in a single practice session.\n* You have a better sense of dedication and perseverance. A child will give up the moment it becomes difficult. You, on the other hand, will stubbornly keep trying until you succeed. This will get you through the initial stages much faster.\n\nThe conclusion is that it's not too late for you to learn the piano, but it will take a lot of effort and discipline.

{"conversations": ["How to save gift wrapping paper?", "We've all seen promotional material for having \"green\" (environmentally sound) events, conserving paper, and saving trees.  In this article we'll see several alternatives to one time usage of rolls of wrapping paper for gifts.\n\n## Reuse wrap paper\n\n1. Wrap the gift in such a way as to promote reuse: When selecting wrapping paper, select paper which is durable. When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.\n2. Unwrap the gift for reuse, too. When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper. Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.\n3. Share the paper with several guests. If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.\n\n\n## Use gift bag with a gift tag\n\n1. Purchase a nice gift bag (or reusable bag), rather than wrapping paper for each gift.\n2. Make and attach a large gift tag to the bottom of the bag covering the manufacturers name, etc. Include at least 12 rows on the tag. Write your name, email, occasion and date on the first row of the tag.\n3. Place gift item in bag and present to honoree as usual. After honoree removes the gift from the bag, they save the bag for the next occasion.\n4. When the honoree has an occasion to give a gift, they write their name, occasion and date on the first blank line on the tag.\n5. Repeat the re-use and gifting process 12 times.\n6. Have the twelfth person to receive the gift bag send an email to everyone listed on the tag with the bag's history. Assuming the bag remains in usable condition, they can then attach a new tag on top of the original tag and repeat the process.\n7. Keep the reuse and gifting chain going until the back is too worn to continue. Ultimately, recycle the bag.\n\n\n## Make a gift display rather than gift wrap\n\n1. Bring unwrapped gifts to the celebration.\n2. Place the gifts on a display table. Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.\n3. Prepare a one page log for the honoree. It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift. The honoree can then use this log to send Thank You notes. Only one sheet of paper is consumed for the entire event!\n4. When it is time to present the gifts, position the honoree behind the table along with the guests. Take photos of the covered table, uncover the table and photograph the table displaying the gifts. (Optionally, make a video of the table being uncovered.)\n\n\n## Gift wrap (blindfold) the honoree instead of the gift\n\n1. If your honoree is adventuresome, blindfold them with an attractive looking bandana or blindfold prior to displaying or presenting any gifts.\n2. Present each gift to the blindfolded honoree while the people giving the gift stand behind them.\n3. Have the honoree identify the gift by feeling of it. If you want to make the task more challenging have the honoree wear attractive looking gloves or mittens while doing this. Optionally, have the honoree guess who gave them the gift.\n4. Of course, take numerous photos (and possibly video) of the gift giving process.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A budget-conscious individual who enjoys gift-giving and is looking for ways to reduce waste and save money.

{"conversations": ["Best way to start investing, for a young person just starting their career?", "First off, I highly recommend the book Get a Financial Life. The basics of personal finance and money management are pretty straightforward, and this book does a great job with it. It is very light reading, and it really geared for the young person starting their career. \n\nNow, with that out of the way, there's really two kinds of \"investing\" to think about:\n\n1. Retirement (401k, IRA, SIMPLE, etc)\n2. Non-Retirement (Brokerage account, investing in individual stocks, day trading, etc)\n\nFor most individuals, it is best to take care of #1 first. Most people shouldn't even think about #2 until they have fully funded their retirement accounts, established an emergency fund, and gotten their debt under control.\n\nThere are lots of financial incentives for retirement investing, both from your employer, and the government. All the more reason to take care of #1 before #2!\n\nYour employer probably offers some kind of 401k (or equivalent, like a 403b) with a company-provided match. This is a potential 100% return on your investment after the vesting period. No investment you make on your own will ever match that. Additionally, there are tax advantages to contributing to the 401k. (The money you contribute doesn't count as taxable income.)\n\n***The best way to start investing is to learn about your employer's retirement plan, and contribute enough to fully utilize the employer matching.***\n\nBeyond this, there are also Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you can open to contribute money to on your own. You should open one of these and start contributing, but only after you have fully utilized the employer matching with the 401k. The IRA won't give you that 100% ROI that the 401k will.\n\nKeep in mind that retirement investments are pretty much \"walled off\" from your day-to-day financial life. Money that goes into a retirement account generally can't be touched until retirement age, unless you want to pay lots of taxes and penalties. You generally don't want to put the money for your house down payment into a retirement account.\n\nOne other thing to note: Your 401K and your IRA is an account that you put money into. Just because the money is sitting in the account doesn't necessarily mean it is invested. You put the money into this account, and then you use this money for investments.

{"conversations": ["How to become hot?", "Being hot is more than just a look\u2014it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you\u2019ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don\u2019t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today\u2019s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you\u2019re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you\u2019ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don\u2019t forget how much you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you\u2019ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don\u2019t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that\u2019s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don\u2019t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the \u201cperfect\u201d body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts \u2013 instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You\u2019ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There\u2019s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can\u2019t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you\u2019re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they\u2019re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men\u2019s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you\u2019d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate amount of skin. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it\u2019s not surprising when people can\u2019t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it\u2019s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It\u2019s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer\u2019s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body\u2019s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn\u2019t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren\u2019t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It\u2019s easy to start slumping forward when you\u2019re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they\u2019re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It\u2019s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It\u2019s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don\u2019t try so hard. Or at least look like you\u2019re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you\u2019re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It\u2019s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It\u2019s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you\u2019re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone\u2019s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don\u2019t brag and look down on others.

These three tricks are arranged from easiest to hardest (smallest numbers to biggest). Even young kids can do the simple number prediction trick.\n\n## Simple number prediction\n\n1. Set the trick up. Tell a friend that you are performing a math trick. You will ask her to do some calculations secretly, then read her mind for their answer.\n2. Write down your prediction. Pretend to think hard for a moment, then write down the number 3 on a piece of paper. Fold the paper in half, without letting anyone see the number.\n3. Ask your friend to write down a number between 1 and 20. She should pick this secretly and keep the piece of paper. We'll go through an example, where your friend secretly picks the number 4. This trick works with any number, but keeping it between 1 and 20 makes it less likely that your friend will make a mistake.\n4. Instruct her to add 1 to her number. Warn her not to give you any sign, not even moving her lips. All you need is your mental powers. For example, if she chose 4, her new number is 4 + 1 = 5.\n5. Tell your friend to double the new number. Have her take the last number she had, and multiply it by 2. 5 x 2 = 10.\n6. Have her add 4 more. Put your hands to your head and concentrate, then tell her to add 4 to her last answer. 10 + 4 = 14.\n7. Divide by 2. Tell her you almost have it, but the number is too big for you to see. Ask her to divide it by 2 to make it easier. 14 \u00f7 2 = 7.\n8. Subtract the original number. Ask your friend to look at the piece of paper she used to remind herself what the original number was. Take the last answer she had and subtract that original number. 7 - 4 = 3.\n9. Show her your prediction. Tell her you've finally read her mind. Ask her to announce the last number she ended up with. Once she has, unfold your piece of paper and reveal the 3 you wrote down. No matter which number she started with, her answer will be 3.\n\n\n## Guess someone's age\n\n1. Tell someone you're going to find his age. Let him know you'll be using your mathematical mind-reading abilities. Give him a calculator if he doesn't want to do the calculations in his head. This trick won't be too impressive with close friends or classmates, since you probably already know their age. Pick someone at least 10 years old and no more than 99 years old.\n2. Ask him to multiply the first digit in his age by five. Remind him to do the math silently, to keep his age secret from you. For example, if he is 32 years old, he should take the 3 and multiply it by 5. The answer is 3 x 5 = 15.\n3. Add 4 to his answer. Tell him to add 4 to the answer he found. In our example, he would silently add 15 + 4 = 19.\n4. Tell him to double his answer. Now your subject should multiply his last answer by 2, and let you know when he's finished. If he's doing the math in his head, ask him \"Are you sure?\" since people are most likely to make a mistake on this step. 19 x 2 = 38.\n5. Have him add the second digit of his age. Next, the person you're \"mind reading\" adds the last number in his age. Tell him this is the last calculation he needs to do. Since the subject of our example is 32 years old, he would add 2 to his last answer. His last answer was 38, so he calculates 38 + 2 = 40.\n6. Ask for his last answer. Have him say the final number out loud, so you and everyone in the room can hear it.\n7. Subtract 8 and tell him his real age. Silently subtract 8 from the number he gave you. The answer is his age, which you should announce to the room. In our example, 40 - 8 = 32.\n8. Try some variations. If you perform this trick more than once, people might figure out how it works. Here are a couple variations to keep it mysterious:\n\t* Instead of adding 4 and later (secretly) subtracting 8, you can add 3 and subtract 6, or add 2 and subtract 4, or even add 25 and subtract 50. Just remember you'll need to subtract twice as much as the original number, because it got doubled in one of the later steps. To really switch it up, try this: double your age, add 2, multiply by 5, and subtract 10. You need both the doubling and multiplication by five to move the first digit of his age (3 in our example) to the tens place where it belongs (3 x 2 x 5 = 30).\n\n\n## Magical 37\n\n1. Hand a volunteer a pencil and paper. This one involves some three digit numbers, so most people will not want to do the math in their head. Warn the volunteer that he will need to do long division.\n2. Ask him to write the same digit 3 times. Tell him to hide the paper from you to prove you're not cheating. Ask him to write a 3-digit number that repeats the same digit three times. For example, he could write 222.\n3. Instruct him to add each digit together. Now your volunteer should treat each of the three digits as a separate number, and find their sum. For example, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n4. Tell him to divide the larger number by the smaller one. He should now take the 3-digit number, and divide it by the\\ smaller one. Give him some time to work this out. 222 / 6 = 37,\n5. Announce that his number is 37.

When trees mature and are harvested for wood that's used in construction, then the captured carbon dioxide is stored for a long time (until the wood decomposes or is burned). However, if no trees are replanted after harvesting this will have had a one-time effect only. Also when wood is burned (for energy or in a wild fire), or if trees die quickly and decompose, then their captured carbon is released again. Of course all trees die eventually even when they are not harvested, this is part of the natural cycle, but a mature forest can store a lot more carbon than a young, newly-planted forest so it's important to keep a forest intact as much as possible.\n\n* The wrong type(s) of trees are planted in the wrong location.\nIn the past there were bad offsetting schemes that planted non-native trees, or planted trees in a location where they would change water flows  and thus change local ecosystems in a negative way. Some offsetting schemes planted  thousands of trees of the same species, resulting in a large monoculture. Such a monoculture hinders biodiversity, is susceptible to diseases and can even damage local communities.\nThere have also been reports that planting trees above a certain latitude can have a net warming effect by changing the albedo and trapping heat. \n\n* Buying offsets reduces the incentive for people to reduce their emissions.\nReducing emissions is much more effective than offsetting. Buying carbon offsets can lead to people thinking they are doing the right thing, whereas they had better spent their time and effort in reducing their emissions. Of course this point goes for all offsetting-schemes and is not specifically for planting trees.\n\n* There are more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions than planting trees.\nNowadays many offsetting schemes invest in development of renewable energy sources (in developing countries) instead of planting trees, simply because it is a more effective and cheaper way to reduce emissions."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "an environmentalist, researcher, or policy maker with a focus on climate change mitigation and sustainable practices.

Both PrPSc and its normal cellular counterpart, PrPC, are encoded by a cellular gene (2, 19). Physical and molecular characterization of PrPSc and PrPC has failed to reveal any chemical differences between the two isoforms (32). However, PrPSc acquires distinctive conformational characteristics upon its conversion from PrPC. Whereas PrPC is soluble in most detergents and can be easily digested by proteases, PrPScis insoluble in detergents and maintains a protease-resistant core, designated PrP27-30, which polymerizes into amyloid (25).\n\nDr. Neena Singh also discovered that prions &quot;piggyback&quot; or attach to another protein called ferritin, as they make their way through the digestive system:\n\nDisease-causing prions are thought to have passed into people when they ate beef from infected cattle, triggering the brain wasting condition called new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or vCJD. But researchers have not been sure exactly how prions enter the body.\nTo find out, Neena Singh and her team at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, mimicked the process of eating and digesting infected meat.\nThey mashed up brain tissue that contained prions from patients who had a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. They then exposed it to a range of harsh digestive enzymes from the mouth, stomach and intestine, which normally break proteins into pieces.\nPrions, which are known to be enormously tough, escape this attack almost unscathed, they showed, as does a second type of protein called ferritin, which stores iron and is abundant in meat. The two proteins seem to stick together, they report in the Journal of Neuroscience.\nThe researchers next added the digested slurry to a lab model of the human gut: a growing sheet of cells from the intestinal lining. By attaching fluorescent tags to the two proteins, they showed that they are transported through the cells hand-in-hand. &quot;Prions probably ride piggyback&quot; through the gut wall into the body, Singh says.\n\nAttaching to ferritin may provide additional protection from digestion, insofar as this removes prions from the digestive system, where proteases are concentrated."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A scientist or researcher specializing in neurobiology, particularly prion diseases.

{"conversations": ["How to make churros?", "The Mexican version of a quick fried cake, churros are incredible tasty treats that couldn't be easier to make. Whether you want to craft them from scratch or are looking for a quicker fix, anyone can whip up a batch of churros at home.\n\n## Make fresh churros\n\n1. Whip the two eggs together with the vanilla in a small bowl. It should be well blended and mixed. When done, set it aside for later. To make richer churros, you can add 1-2 more eggs, though this is totally up to taste.\n2. Heat up 1-1/2\" of oil in a large frying pan until 375\u00b0F. If you don't have a candy thermometer, keep everything on medium-low, and you'll be ready just as small amounts of \"smoke\" is rising from the top of the oil. If you drop a small test ball of dough in, the oil should immediately start bubbling. A thick-bottomed pan is always your best bet, as they hold heat much better than thinner pans. You can also wait to pre-heat the oil until after you've made the dough. However, this can take some time, so starting now is a good idea if you think you can do the dough quickly. If you do, just keep the burner on medium, not high, to prevent burning.\n3. In a medium saucepan, add the water, brown sugar, salt, and butter and heat until boiling. Stir it frequently, until everything is well dissolved and the mixture is bubbling nicely. Once it is a consistent, boiling mixture, immediately lower the heat to low.\n4. Add the flour to the hot water mixture all at once, stirring until a firm dough. This takes some arms, so really get in there with a wooden spoon to stir everything up into it is well blended. Turn the heat off when done.\n5. Pour the egg/vanilla mixture in and stir until you have a consistent dough. You should have a glossy ball of dough when you've mixed everything up completely. If you pull up on the dough sharply, it should keep it's hook shape. If it doesn't add and beat in another egg.\n6. Consider how you want to make the long, round shapes churros are famous for. There are a lot of ways to turn your ball of dough into long, delicious churros, and none of them are wrong. Use whatever works for you, making long, thin, cylindrical treats:\n\t* \n\t* Pinch and Roll: The simplest method, simply pull off a 2\" ball of dough and roll it between your hands to form a snake-like shape, roughly 1/2\" thick. Decorative Piper: Usually used for icing, these have star-shaped tips that will get the ridges found on fairground churros. Pack the dough where the icing goes and then push it through to make perfect, even logs of dough. DIY Decorative Piper: Take a large freezer back and fill it with dough. Then cut the bottom corner off the bag to form a small opening. Squeeze the dough through this whole to make your logs.\n7. Fry the logs in hot oil until golden brown on all sides, turning frequently. The total cooking time will depend on how thick the churros are, but you should be able to tell easily when they are done, as the outsides will be an alluring golden brown. Don't put more than 3-4 churros in the pan at once -- too much will drop the temperature of the oil rapidly, leading to greasy churros.\n8. Drain the finished churros on paper towels. Set them aside on a plate of paper towels, then lightly pat down the tops with more paper towels to get rid of excess oil.\n9. Combine white sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and roll the churros in the mixture. You've got your finished churros! Combine them in as much or as little cinnamon sugar as you want -- they'll be delicious either way. Some people take things a step further by drizzling the finished churros in chocolate sauce, too.\n\n\n## Make \"instant\" churros\n\n1. Purchase a roll of pre-made biscuits from your favorite brand. The dough in a \"real\" churro is a little different than the dough in a biscuit, but the basic ingredients are the same and they will cook similarly. It is usually best to use the smaller biscuits, allowing you to more easily fry everything. If you don't want the fat of biscuit batter, you can use 1 cup hot water and 3-1/4 cups of your favorite all-purpose pancake mix. Blend into a dough and proceed like normal.\n2. Take two biscuits and roll them in between your hands into ten-inch ropes. Churros need to be long and thin in order to really cook nicely. Try to make all the ropes roughly the same diameter for the best results.\n3. Twist biscuits together and pinch ends. Simply make a rope out of the biscuits by braiding one over the other, When done, pinch both ends together to fuse them. You can also lightly roll the whole thing together to keep the centers together.\n4. Alternatively, use an icing pipette or icing bag to pump out the strips. Simply put the dough into a large plastic bag, then snip off the bottom corner with scissors. You can push the dough straight out the bottom of the back in perfect strips.\n5. Pour vegetable oil into a medium-sized frying pan. Heat until it reached 375F. Make sure there is about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of oil in the pan to cover the churros. There should be enough oil so that they float freely while frying, and all sides, except the very top, are being cooked at the same time. If you don't have an oil thermometer, 375 is when there is barely smoke coming off the top of the oil. Don't let it get much farther than this point.\n6. Drop the dough twists into the pan, turning occasionally. Fry for about 2 minutes, or until golden brown. They don't take long, but you can easily see when they are finished by the color on the outsides. Once they look good to eat, they usually are.\n7. Remove the churros with the slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel. Pat them down with paper towels to remove excess oil, which will make them soggy if it cools on the churro.\n8. Roll the twisted dough in cinnamon and sugar mixture. In a separate bowl, mix up 1/2 cup of sugar with a teaspoon of cinnamon. Then roll the warm churros in the mixture to coat them deliciously.\n9. Serve warm, with chocolate dip if desired. They are fine on their own or with a delicious chocolate dip.

{"conversations": ["How to wear a cowboy hat properly?", "Cowboy hats have a long tradition, both for functional purposes while working and as a fashion statement. Even if it seems as simple as setting the hat on your head and going about your business, there are some rules to follow if you want to wear a cowboy hat properly. You need to get a hat that fits right, shape it a little bit, make sure the front is forward, and angle to give your look the proper attitude.\n\n## Choose your hat\n\n1. Get the right size. The first step to properly wearing a cowboy hat is making sure the hat is the right size and fits your head properly. Cowboy hats should typically fit snug around your head. If you are buying one, know your hat size ahead of time but also try the hat on before you buy it.\n2. Fix your current hat to fit better. You may have a hat already that is just barely too big but not big enough that you would want to get a smaller size. You can fix this. You can buy foam strip that is specifically made to put into hats to make them fit tighter. Depending on how much you need, and the shape of your head, you can either put this foam all the way around, or you can put a little in the front and back, just on the sides, or even just the front or just the back. Figure out where your hat is fitting too loosely. If the whole hat is sitting too low on your head, you probably want to put some sizing foam around the whole hat. There should be a band around the inside of the hat that you can flip up and place the foam strip under. Then flip the band back down before wearing the hat.\n3. Pick the right hat. You have a lot of options when it comes to cowboy hats. The main material choices are felt (made of beaver or rabbit pelt), leather, and straw. Felt hats are warmer so they tend to be worn more in the cold seasons. Straw hats are better for staying cool during hot days.\n4. Shape your hat. Most cowboy hats can be conformed to a certain shape by gently bending and squeezing them. How exactly you do this will depend on the material of the hat itself. You want the front and back of the brim to be fairly flat. Curl the sides so they stick up just slightly. You don\u2019t want to curl them too tightly. You can also gently dent the sides of the crown of the hat. No tools are required for this. Simply use your hands.\n\n\n## Put the hat on your head\n\n1. Adjust your hair. You need to make sure that your hair does not get in the way of your hat sitting properly on your head. If you have short hair, this won\u2019t apply to you. For longer hair, it can be a good idea to slick your hair back so it lays smoothly. Don\u2019t pile your hair up on your head in any way. If you need to tie it in place, a ponytail that hangs straight down is the best option.\n2. Put the bow to the back. One of the most basic rules is making sure that the hat is on your head correctly with the front to the front. Most cowboy hats have a small bow on the inside lining around the headband. The bow should be in the back of your head. If your hat does not have this bow, a general rule is that the hat will be narrower at the front.\n3. Angle your brim accordingly. Positioning your hat in different ways can affect the way you look in the way. If you want to appear casual and friendly, tilt the front of the hat up just slightly so you can see about half of you forehead. To look more serious, or almost mysterious, lower the brim to just above your eyebrows. Slanting the hat slightly to the left or right will give you an appearance of being confident, almost to the point of looking for women or for trouble.\n4. Pick the right outfit. Your best and simplest bet to wear with a cowboy hat is a button up shirt, jeans, and a nice pair of cowboy boots. The shirt be a plain color or plaid. Flannel shirt work well too. You want basic, straight leg blue jeans with no extra pockets on the sides, no designs or extra buttons on the back pockets, no intentional bleaching or stain marks. Just classic blue jeans. If you are going to wear a cowboy hat, boots are pretty much a must. It\u2019s going to look wrong if you try to go out with some sneakers on. You should also tuck in your shirt and most likely wear a nice black or brown leather belt. Fancy belt buckle is optional.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An individual with an interest in western culture, fashion, or cowboy-themed events.

{"conversations": ["How to manage urinary incontinence in children?", "Urinary incontinence (UI) is a medical term that refers to the loss of bladder control, which leads to accidental urine loss. This can happen during the day or at night. Urinary incontinence is a condition that affects many children when they are young and disappears as they grow and develop. To provide better support for your child with UI, it is important to understand how UI works and possible management solutions.\n\n## Understand the bladder\n\n1. Know how the bladder works. The bladder is a bodily organ that is essentially a muscular storage sack for urine. Normally, the bladder muscle sack can stay relaxed and expand to accept urine for several hours. The muscle that forms the bladder sack is called the detrusor muscle, which is also responsible for bladder emptying. The other main muscles of the bladder are called the sphincters, which are two rings of muscle surrounding the bladder outlet through which it empties. One sphincter is involuntary (you aren't aware of it) and the other is usually under our control, making it our voluntary sphincter. The latter is the muscle you can use to hold the urine back until you go to the bathroom.\n2. Learn about bladder control. There are nerves in your body that provides you with the sensation of bladder fullness. This is the early warning system that the bladder is ready to empty. When you urinate, the nerves to the detrusor muscle signal it to contract or squeeze, while at the same time, the nerves to the involuntary sphincter make it relax. When you release your voluntary sphincter, you allow yourself to urinate. By around age two, most children become aware that the sensation that they feel \u201cdown there\u201d is the need for the bladder to empty. This allows them to express the need to go to the bathroom. About a year later, they develop the ability to \u201chold it\u201d until they have a chance to go to the bathroom.\n3. Be aware of the causes of incontinence. There are issues that can cause problems when a child is learning how to \u201chold it\u201d. While most kids develop the ability to hold their urine and go to the bathroom when they have the opportunity to do so, problems can arise that can mess up a child's ability to control her bladder. These issues that are related to childhood incontinence can include:\n\t* A bladder that is unable to store the usual amount of urine. Weakness of the detrusor muscles or sphincter. Structural abnormalities of the urinary tract. The body producing larger amounts of urine than is normal. Bladder irritation from infections, such as urinary tract infections, or other bladder irritants. The bladder receiving unexpected and premature nerve signals to empty. Something in the area of the bladder keeping it from filling completely, such as other excrement caused by constipation. Excessive postponement of urination, or holding it for too long. Chronic constipation.\n4. Disregard the myths about incontinence. If your child has been dealing with incontinence for an extended period of time, chances are she is dealing with more of an issue that simply being too lazy to get to the bathroom. A lot of parents tend to think that daytime incontinence is a display of laziness, but it is important to keep in mind that something else might be causing your child to have accidents. Common thoughts that parents have that should probably be ruled out if your child has been dealing with incontinence for awhile. In these situations, you should know that:\n\t* Children who wet themselves are not just too lazy to go to the bathroom. Children who wet themselves are not too busy playing or watching TV. Children who wet themselves want to go to the bathroom and do not willfully wet themselves. Children who wet themselves do not choose to wait until the last minute. Wetting themselves does bother them.\n\n\n## Treat incontinence\n\n1. Look for signs of an overactive bladder. There are some common signs that your child has an overactive bladder. Signs that your child might have an incontinence problem related to under filling include:\n\t* Your child dashes to the bathroom, crosses her legs, and wiggles or drops to the floor, sitting hard on her heel. If asked, your child will often admit that she releases a little urine on the way to the bathroom. Many children also will admit that, sometimes, they run to the bathroom but only void a small amount of urine, even though they felt like they really needed to go.\n2. Look out for a cause for the \"sudden-urge-to-urinate\" phase. Some kids, while they are growing up, go through a phase where they suddenly, without warning, need to go to the bathroom really badly. This underdeveloped control, which presents itself as urge incontinence, often resolves with time as the child matures. However, this can also be the symptoms of a functionally small bladder or an overactive bladder. There are some medications that can actually increase a bladder's holding capacity. You should talk to a doctor about the options for dealing with a small or overactive bladder.\n3. Be aware of overfilling. There is a filling condition, called overfilling, that can also lead to incontinence. Overfilling is a less common condition that occurs when the bladder won't or can't empty and has an usually large capacity. Symptoms of an abnormally large capacity bladder include:\n\t* Voiding large volumes of urine frequently during the day. This can happen if the kidneys produce enormous volumes of urine. You should take your child to a doctor if you notice your child voiding a large amount of urine every time she goes to the bathroom, especially if there is a change in the amount from usual. Infrequent voiding, which is considered less than two or three times a day. This can be a sign of a spinal nerve problem, such as spina bifida or cerebral palsy. If your child has not been diagnosed with a spinal nerve problem, it is unlikely that this is the cause of your child's incontinence.\n4. Notice if your child is holding it for too long. Sometimes, if your child gets in the habit of holding his urine too long, it can result in over filling of the bladder. Your child's bladder can become enlarged if he is a chronic urine holder, which means he avoids going to the bathroom, even when he really, really has to pee. When this goes on for a long time, the muscles related to urinating become over trained, which means the muscles relax poorly, leading to bladder dysfunction like incontinence. This happens frequently when a child does not want to use the bathroom at school or other public places.\n5. Consider behavior modification therapy. Behavioral modification may be able to help your child with her urge incontinence. Most experts today favor behavior modification therapy over drugs as a first line treatment for daytime wetting of almost all types. Behavior modification is a method of training to relearn a skill such as bladder control. The therapy must be done strictly and consistently in order to get the desired results, such as your child being able to control her bladder. Behavior modification therapy generally works best in children who are older than five or six years of age. This is because younger children generally lack the self-discipline to stick to the therapy schedule. However, each child should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Child psychologists can provide good advice on how to go about creating a schedule.\n6. Create a schedule. If your child suffers from an overactive bladder, you need to create a schedule to help him. After your child goes to the bathroom in the morning, begin a strict timed voiding schedule. Normally, parents pick every two hours as the scheduled voiding time. Your child must go to the bathroom every two hours, even if he says he doesn't have to go at that specific time. That is actually the point, to get him to the bathroom before he has a bladder spasm. If you wait for the bladder spasm, you are reinforcing the absence of control. If your child does go and attempts to void, even a little, it reinforces his control about when and where he goes. If your child has an overfilled bladder, you should create the same schedule with an added step. Your child should wait four to five minutes after going to the bathroom and then try to go again. This is called double voiding in an attempt to reduce that lingering bladder volume. The goal is to change voiding habits and allow the bladder to carry a more normal volume of urine.\n7. Use an alarm system. In addition to a schedule, set an alarm to help your child remember to go to the bathroom. It can be hard to remember to go to the bathroom every two hours. Because of this, its important to set up an alarm system. When your child is at home or visiting family, such as staying at Grandma's house, set alarm clocks that go off every two hours. You can set these alarms on a smartphone or alarm clock. You can also get your child a watch that beeps or vibrates silently every two hours as a reminder for when she is at school. You may also consider trying a bed-wetting alarm if your child has nighttime incontinence (bed-wetting).\n8. Extend the voiding time. Once you have followed this schedule for four to six weeks, you should extend the voiding time. Normally, you should see improvement within four to six weeks. However, this does not mean you should stop the schedule. You should extend the time so that your child tries to urinate every three or four hours, rather than every two.\n\n\n## Treat urinary tract infections\n\n1. Notice urinary tract infections. You need to pay attention to your child to look for certain causes of incontinence. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are most common in girls who have just started school or have recently been potty trained. In addition to incontinence, UTIs can also cause frequent urination, a burning sensation when she urinates, cloudy or dark colored urine, strong smelling urine, and pain in the lower abdomen. UTIs can be treated with antibiotics. Some children who get frequent UTIs also have a condition called asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). These children, most frequently girls, have bacteria colonizing the bladder, meaning that they reside there, similar to having bacteria quietly living on our skin. This increase in bacteria in the urine can sometimes be the cause of frequent UTIs.\n2. Keep irritation at a minimum. Many kids, particularly girls, will develop irritation and inflammation in the area of the urethral and vaginal openings when they have a UTI. You can use certain creams to help relieve the irritation your child feels. In particular, a zinc oxide-containing skin barrier cream or ointment such as Desitin or Triple Paste can be very helpful. You can purchase these creams at your local pharmacy. Follow the directions on the bottle or box that the cream comes in.\n3. Change your child's clothing when it becomes wet. The bacteria that creates a UTI thrives in moist areas. When your child experiences incontinence and leaks a bit of urine onto her clothes, it's important that she changes into dry clothes to keep her from getting a UTI or to relieve the symptoms of her UTI. This will also keep it from coming back. You can explain this to her so that she does it herself, or you can ask her to tell you when this happens so that you can help her change.\n4. Ask your doctor about antibiotics. If your child has recurrent UTIs, you should talk to the doctor about getting antibiotics to clear up the infection and prevent new infections. Your child's doctor will be able to tell you whether or not antibiotics are the appropriate treatment for your child to prevent infections. Your child will need antibiotics if he has an active UTI. The most common antibiotics used for prophylaxis, or prevention of infections, are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim sulfa. These are usually given once a day, at bedtime, at about \u00bc of the usual full treatment dose given to adults.\n\n\n## Treat constipation\n\n1. Be aware of constipation. Another common cause of incontinence is constipation. When large amounts of stool stays in the body rather than being expelled, it can limit how much room the bladder has to expand and causes the bladder to have unpredictable contractions, both of which cause incontinence. Constipation usually causes infrequent bowel movements for 3 days or more in a row, hard, pebbly stools, very large stools, or pain when moving the bowels.\n2. Have your doctor check your child. If you aren't sure how bad your child's constipation is, have a doctor figure out whether or not your child has a lot of stool backed up in her system. This can be done with the use of X-rays or through a physical examination. Knowing for sure that your child is constipated will help her overcome her incontinence issues.\n3. Ask your child to drink lots of fluids throughout the day. Many kids with urgency and incontinence tend not to drink much fluid, which actually makes their constipation worse. Try to have your child drink at least eight glasses of water each day to stay hydrated. If your child doesn't like drinking plain water, you can give him fruit juices, milk (no more than 2-3 cups a day), and sports drinks.\n4. Increase your child's fiber intake. To help fight constipation, increase your child's daily fiber intake. Fiber is one of the best ways to get your child's bowels working properly. There are plenty of foods that are high in fiber. Try introducing as many foods that are high in fiber as possible into your child's diet. Foods high is fiber include:\n\t* Fresh fruit and vegetables, including raspberries, blueberries, green peas, spinach, collard greens, acorn squash, kale, and broccoli. Whole grain breads with at least three to four grams of fiber per serving. High fiber cereals, such as Raisin Bran, Fiber One, Shredded Wheat, and All Bran. Beans, including black, lima, garbanzo, and pinto beans. Lentils and popcorn are also high in fiber.\n5. Give your child laxatives. Adding fiber-rich food to your child's diet may not be enough. If your child is still having problems, try child-safe laxatives. One laxative that is safe and frequently used is propylene glycol, more commonly known as MiraLax. MiraLax causes water to be transported into the bowel, thereby softening the stool and improving movement. You should check with your child's doctor for guidance before giving MiraLax or other laxatives to your child. Most kids require between \u00bd capfuls and two capfuls per day, and the dose may be adjusted as needed.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned parent or caregiver of a child experiencing urinary incontinence.

{"conversations": ["How to drive economically?", "Everyone needs to use a car from time to time, but gas can be expensive. Driving more economically can save you money and keep your car\u2019s parts from wearing quickly. By avoiding aggressive driving, managing gears and electronics, and performing regular maintenance, you can drive more economically no matter where you\u2019re going.\n\n## Avoid aggressive drive\n\n1. Brake in a controlled manner. Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you\u2019ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don\u2019t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel.\n2. Accelerate smoothly. Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money.\n3. Minimize distractions. Whether you\u2019re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions. Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It\u2019s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.\n\n\n## Manage gear and electronics\n\n1. Use air conditioning wisely. At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way.\n2. Cut down on electronics. Your car\u2019s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren\u2019t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings.\n3. Use your gears effectively. Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car\u2019s engine. To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration. While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently. Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you\u2019re new to the technique.\n\n\n## Perform routine maintenance\n\n1. Check your tire pressure regularly. Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently.\n2. Use the right specification of engine oil. Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner\u2019s manual.\n3. Get your car serviced regularly. Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.\n\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Pack light. Bringing extra luggage or hauling large items requires more gas to get your car from place to place. Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle.\n2. Map your journey. Getting lost certainly won\u2019t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you\u2019re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient.\n3. Carpool when possible. Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You\u2019ll also save your car from more wear and tear.\n4. Combine errands. Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start \u201ccold\u201d less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally-focused individual, possibly a commuter or car owner, looking for ways to minimize their environmental impact while still maintaining a budget-friendly driving experience.

{"conversations": ["I've been writing C and C++ code for almost twenty years, but there's one aspect of these languages that I've never really understood. I've obviously used regular casts i.e.\n```MyClass *m = (MyClass *)ptr;\n```\nall over the place, but there seem to be two other types of casts, and I don't know the difference. What's the difference between the following lines of code?\n```MyClass *m = (MyClass *)ptr;\nMyClass *m = static_cast(ptr);\nMyClass *m = dynamic_cast(ptr);\n```", "## static_cast\n\n`static_cast` is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. `static_cast` performs no runtime checks. This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, and thus a check would be unnecessary. Here is an example:\n\n```\nvoid func(void *data) {\n  // Conversion from MyClass* -> void* is implicit\n  MyClass *c = static_cast<MyClass*>(data);\n  ...\n}\n\nint main() {\n  MyClass c;\n  start_thread(&func, &c)  // func(&c) will be called\n      .join();\n}\n```\nIn this example, you know that you passed a `MyClass` object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this.\n\n## dynamic_cast\n\n`dynamic_cast` is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a `bad_cast` exception is thrown in that case).\n\n```\nif (JumpStm *j = dynamic_cast<JumpStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n} else if (ExprStm *e = dynamic_cast<ExprStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n}\n```\nAn \"up-cast\" (cast to the base class) is always valid with both `static_cast` and `dynamic_cast`, and also without any cast, as an \"up-cast\" is an implicit conversion (assuming the base class is accessible, i.e. it's a `public` inheritance).\n\n## Regular Cast\n\nThese casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering `dynamic_cast`. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of `const_cast`, `static_cast` and `reinterpret_cast`, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use `dynamic_cast`.\n\nIn addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the \"equivalent\" `static_cast` sequence would give you a compile-time error for that.\n\nSome people prefer C-style casts because of their brevity.

{"conversations": ["How to peel plums?", "Peeled plums are perfect for pies, jam, cakes, and baby food. If you try to peel a plum by simply pulling back the skin, you'll end up with a sticky mess on your hands. Instead, blanch the plums and then place them in an ice bath or trim the skin off with a knife. This simple techniques are quick, easy, and will leave you with delicious plum flesh.\n\n## Blanch plums\n\n1. Boil a pot of water on the stovetop. Choose a pot large enough to hold all your plums and fill half of it with water. It'll probably take about 10 minutes to boil..\n\t* Place a lid on the pot to help the water to boil quicker.\n2. Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Add water and ice to the bowl at a 50:50 ratio. This will act as an ice bath for the plums.\n3. Slice an \"x\" on the bottom of each plum. Use a paring knife to cut a cross hatch at the bottom of the plum (the side opposite the stem). Make each cut to be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. This will make it nice and easy to peel back the skin. Don\u2019t worry about making the cut deep, simply cut through the skin of the plum.\n4. Blanch the plums for 45 seconds in boiling water. Carefully place the plums into the pot of water. It is important not to leave the plums in the water for longer than 45 seconds, as the flesh will go mushy and the plums will start to disintegrate. Always be careful when cooking with hot water to avoid burns.\n5. Submerge the plums in the ice water for 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the plums from the boiling water into the ice bath. The icy water will help to pull the skin away from the flesh of the plums. Make sure that all the plums are fully submerged in the water. If some of the plums aren\u2019t submerged in the ice bath, make another ice bath for them.\n6. Peel the skin off the plums. Place your finger under 1 of the little flaps formed by the \"x\" you sliced, and pull back the flap. The skin should easily come loose in 1 big strip. Keep pulling back the flaps on all four sides until you've completely peeled the plum. If there is still a little skin on the plum, use a paring knife to slice off any remaining skin.\n7. Cut around the circumference of the plum. Press the paring knife firmly into the flesh until it hits the stone. Follow the natural seam in the skin and cut right around the plum. Keeping cutting until you have split the plum in half.If you don\u2019t have a paring knife, use a sharp kitchen knife instead.\n8. Twist each half of the plum in opposite directions to pull it away from the stone. Hold 1 half of the plum in each hand. Firmly grip the halves and slowly turn them away from each other until one half of the plum comes loose from the stone.\n9. Lever the stone out with a spoon. Push a dessert spoon under the stone and then press the handle down to pop the stone out. If the stone won\u2019t coming out, push the spoon under the opposite side of the stone and then lever it out.\n\n\n## Use a knife\n\n1. Cut the plum in half and pop the stone out. Place the plum on a chopping board and cut around the circumference of the plum. Use a teaspoon to pop the stone out of the plum.\n2. Chop both pieces of plum in half. Cut each plum half lengthways to create a wedge. This makes the plum easier to peel.If your plum is particularly large, consider chopping each piece of plum into thirds.\n3.

{"conversations": ["How to choose bridal lingerie?", "Choosing bridal lingerie is one of the many exciting things you get to do as bride-to-be, and it\u2019s something so personal that only you can do it. For lingerie that you\u2019re planning to wear under your dress on your big day, you\u2019ll need to choose a style that works well under your specific dress. If you\u2019re planning to get other lingerie to change into after the wedding, you have unlimited options with which you can surprise your fianc\u00e9!\n\n## Find lingerie for your dress\n\n1. Go with a slip and shapewear if you have a sheath dress. Light flowing fabrics make beautiful wedding gowns but may require a little extra support underneath to avoid showing unwanted bulges or panty lines. Find shapewear that hides any problem areas, and a slip made from similar fabric as your gown in case your gown slips. To reduce the layers you need to wear, try a shaping slip in the same color as your dress.\n2. Choose high-waisted shaping lingerie for a mermaid dress. Mermaid dresses show off all your natural curves by hugging your body, so consider lingerie that draws in your waist and doesn\u2019t show panty lines. A high-waisted thong is a good option, on its own or coupled with a bustier.\n3. Find a bustier or corset for your ballgown. Many ballgown style dresses already have a structured corset or bustier in them, but if yours doesn\u2019t, find one that matches the color of your dress. Choose a bustier bra that\u2019s seamless and strapless to support and lift your bust while slimming your torso. Panties for your ballgown can be any style you choose, since a ballgown is loose in the skirt area and you won\u2019t be able to see panty lines.\n4. Choose any lingerie for A-line dresses. A-line, or princess-style dresses, are fitted at the top and flow out below the bustline. If this is the type of dress you have, you can choose any lingerie based on your comfort or preference instead of shaping or support. Keep in mind the shape of the top of your dress when choosing a bra; if the dress has a deep neckline or is strapless, you\u2019ll want to find a strapless bra or skip a bra altogether.\n5. Find a backless bra with adhesive sides for a backless dress. If you have a halter or other type of backless dress, you may want support or coverage from your lingerie. Choose an adhesive bra that matches the color of your dress to get the support you need. Adhesive bras also work great for strapless dresses if you can\u2019t find a strapless bra that you like.\n6. Match the lingerie color to your dress. Try bringing a swatch of the fabric that your gown is made from with you when you shop for lingerie. Some bridal gown retailers offer a swatch so you can match accessories with your gown. If you don\u2019t have a sample of the fabric, try ordering more than one shade of lingerie and keep the one that best matches your gown. Matching your lingerie with your dress instead of your skin tone is helpful in case your gown slips a bit. Your lingerie won\u2019t be as obvious if the shade matches your dress.\n\n\n## Choose wed night lingerie\n\n1. Wear whatever you\u2019ll feel sexy in. There are certain myths surrounding wedding night lingerie that it has to look a certain way, but only you and your fianc\u00e9 know what you like. This means if you don\u2019t want to wear white, don\u2019t! You can wear anything from boyfriend-style pajamas to French maid costumes, so don\u2019t be afraid to choose something unique to you.\n2. Choose flowery white lace for the classic feminine look. If you want to go a traditional route, find a comfortable white or cream bra and panty set made from sheer flowery lace. Or go with a short white lacy gown. Some lingerie combines lace and faux-fur for an extra feminine touch.\n3. Try an artsy corset with suspenders, stockings, and heels for a bolder approach. If bold is more your style, think straps! Look for a detailed, beaded or embroidered corset with suspenders, fishnet or lace thigh-highs, and a pair of matching heels. Choose any color theme you like for this lingerie based on your preference. Some corsets have a connected underwear component with suspenders; others don\u2019t, in which case, you can find a matching thong to complete your outfit.\n4. Choose a lacy jumpsuit or teddie if you like one-pieces. Find a lacy halter mini-shorts jumpsuit to combine sporty and feminine looks. Or go bold and feminine with a sheer or strappy teddie in any color that you like. To stay on the more traditional side, choose white or cream for your one-piece lingerie. Or choose a pastel pink or blue for a romantic, feminine effect. Black or red also work well with these pieces if you want a bolder look.\n5. Get a sheer dressing gown for some added luxury. Regardless of what style lingerie you get, consider a sheer dressing gown to drape over it, as an extra piece to remove on your wedding night, for lounging around in the morning, or both.\n6. Consider a separate registry just for lingerie if you\u2019re having trouble deciding. If you like too many pieces to choose, let a few close friends and your fianc\u00e9 choose for you! Create a registry online with a lingerie store, add some of your favorite pieces, and give your bridesmaids and fianc\u00e9 the link before your bridal shower. This gives the people who know you best a chance to help you decide. You may end up with more than one item, but that\u2019s okay. Choose one for your wedding night and save the rest for your honeymoon!\n\n\n## Consider your body type\n\n1. Choose strappy lingerie on a muscular frame. You can probably pull off some pretty daring looks if you\u2019re in good shape. Choose lingerie with lots of straps, bold colors, or a cinched waistline to show it off.\n2. Try a plunging neckline and briefs if you\u2019re pear-shaped. Pear-shaped women are smaller up top with wider hips, butt, and thighs. Show off this type of figure with pieces that go low at the neckline and brief-style underwear. Or experiment with colors by wearing bold, bright patterns up top.\n3. Go with v-cut panties and a full coverage bra or corset if you\u2019re apple-shaped. Apple-shaped ladies carry more weight in the top half of their bodies and have slender legs. Show off this type of body by providing full bust coverage and concealing your stomach area, if you want to. Think lots of lace up top and brightly colored panties.\n4. Try a garter belt or any waist-cincher for an hourglass figure. Hourglass figures have a proportioned build with bust and thigh measurements that are about equal, and are slimmer at the waist. Show off your waistline with a flattering belt or any accessory that draws attention to it.\n5. Go wireless for a small bust. If you don\u2019t need an underwire bra on your wedding day, don\u2019t bother with one. Try a feminine lacy bralette or a racerback style bra if you have a small chest. You can likely find some cute halter one-pieces as well.\n6. Choose high-waisted bottoms for a long torso. If you have a long torso and shorter legs, you can choose from the variety of high-waisted styles that are so popular. Try a lacy crop top set with high-waisted bottoms to draw more attention to your shoulders and legs.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A bride-to-be or a close friend or family member assisting in the selection of bridal lingerie for the upcoming wedding.

Many people have to decide based on who their insurance will cover; however, some physical therapists specialize in certain conditions and can offer expertise that an insurance-covered physical therapist cannot. Choose based on what you can afford and how important your timely recovery is.\n2. Call your insurance to ask how many visits are covered. Many insurance plans have caps on physical therapy treatments, from 10 to 35. After severe injuries, you may be able to apply to the insurance company for more treatments, if they are absolutely necessary.\n3. Ask the physical therapy office if you can have a discounted rate, if you are paying out of pocket. Insurance companies often get a discounted rate, so they may afford you the same price. Ask the physical therapist directly, rather than the secretary, because it is the physical therapist that is agreeing to alter their wages.\n\n\n## Physical therapy sessions\n\n1. Have a positive attitude toward physical therapy. Will power and optimism during a recovery are almost as important as doctor's care. Your commitment to the exercises will have a direct correlation to the swiftness and completeness of your recovery.\n2. Wear athletic shoes and loose-fitting, flexible clothing to all physical therapy sessions. If you have to go to your session straight from work, then keep spare exercise clothing in your bag or car.

Your physical therapist may allow you to warm up before the session, on a machine or by stretching. This also makes certain that you are never late, because you will be charged for the session from the moment your appointment time arrives. Make sure to be 15 minutes early for your first appointment. You will need to fill out insurance and health forms. Bring a list of your medications and other current treatments.\n5. Discuss your goals with your physical therapist at your first meeting. Pain and injury are different for everyone, so you must make it clear whether you want to return to work, get rid of pain, walk without weight supports or run a marathon. Tell the physical therapist how many sessions you can afford, so the plan can be adjusted for what you will do during your sessions and what you can continue at home. Remember that this may need to be adjusted on the future, based on your progress. In most cases, the harder you work doing prescribed exercises at home, the fewer office sessions you will need to have.\n6. Ask your physical therapist to give you a list of prescribed exercises, with diagrams. They should establish what and when you should be doing each exercise, so that you are clear about your \"homework.\" Ask the physical therapist to show you each exercise as well as having you do repetitions in the office.\n7. Tell your physical therapist whenever something is painful. Mistakes can be made if you do not communicate properly about your pain levels. The physical therapist can also tell you what pain is natural to the healing process and what is unnatural, allowing the exercises to be adjusted.\n8. Ask to be treated by the same physical therapist every time. This provides consistency, familiarity and a greater chance that you will be able to accomplish your goals.\n9. Ask plenty of questions. You must be proactive about your treatment. If you don't understand why you are doing something or how you should do something, you are more likely to refrain from the exercise and fail to progress.\n10. Report your progress at the beginning of each physical therapy session. Make sure you tell your therapist any new pain or problems, as well as your positive progress. They will usually write this on your chart to ensure you won't have complications from the regime.\n11. Leave your cell phone and personal problems at the door when you go to physical therapy. You must use this valuable time to focus on health and your body. You may need to learn to recognize your body's warning signs, which is hard to do when you are distracted.\n\n\n## Physical therapy at home\n\n1. Create a schedule to do your physical therapy exercises at home. Do not leave it up to chance whether you have the time or not. They are as important as doctor-prescribed medicine and should be treated as a priority during your day.\n2. Set aside a space to do physical therapy. Keep a corner of your home ready with a yoga mat or exercise ball, so that you can do a few repetitions when you have some free time. This will help you get into the mentality of exercise as a lifestyle choice.\n3. Take the prescribed therapy exercises seriously. If you are advised to do them once per day, do them every day, and if you are asked to do them 3 times per day, do them 3 times per day. Frequent exercises are usually prescribed when there is a limited time for you to regain your mobility during the healing process, and they should be treated with gravity.\n4. Progress to more repetitions or sets as you get stronger. Many physical therapists will tell you to add 5 repetitions or 1 more set when the exercise becomes easy. You may also be asked to add more weight to your exercises.\n5. Ask the physical therapist for an appropriate regimen to continue after you no longer attend sessions. They should be able to adjust an exercise regime according to your particular health problems. Establish goals that you should reach 3 months, 6 months and a year into the future.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A patient who has recently started physical therapy, seeking advice on maximizing the benefits of their treatment.

{"conversations": ["Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20\u00b0C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.", "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp. Perparing food outside in the cold takes a lot longer than in a heated kitchen, severly limits what you can do, and may also risk predator encounters depending on what is around your area in the winter."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A young, adventurous, and environmentally conscious individual embarking on an unconventional living experiment in Stockholm.

{"conversations": ["How to identify different types of forklifts?", "Whether you're new to forklifts, or an experienced operator, it is always important to know as much as you can about forklifts and their operation. It is equally important to be able to identify different forklifts, both by look and name. This is especially important when searching for forklift operating jobs, as it will allow you to know which type of forklift you will be operating and if you have the experience to do so.\n\n## Identify basic \"forklifts\" and jack\n\n1. Know what manual pallet jacks are. Although not usually considered a forklift, pallet jacks are some of the most common manual forms of pallet handling that people will come across in logistics industries. Manual pallet jacks are usually very simple in design; the handle lever is squeezed to lower the pallet jack forks for insertion into a pallet, and the handle lever is moved in the opposite direction to engage the hydraulics that allows the pallet to be raised by pumping the handle.\n2. Familiarize yourself with motorized pallet jacks. Motorized pallet jacks, on the other hand, are much more varied than manual pallet jacks. They are almost always powered by electric batteries. Some are walk-behind, some are ride-on, and some even require the operator to take a side stance to ride on/operate, which is considerably more difficult to learn. Motorized pallet jacks usually have extended pallet forks that are used to handle two pallets at a time for greater efficiency in large warehouse operations, such as order picking. However, single pallet handlers are more common in smaller warehouses, for greater maneuverability and ease of use.\n3. Learn to recognize walkie stackers. Walkie stackers, also known as pedestrian forklifts, are still usually not considered a true forklift. However, they very closely resemble a forklift with forks, a mast, backrest, etc. They are almost always operated with a walk-behind pedestrian operator. They are frequently used in retail, very small storerooms, small scale warehousing, etc.\n\n\n## Identify counterbalance forklifts\n\n1. Know what standard counterbalance forklifts are. Being the most iconic, recognized, and popular type of forklift, a standard counterbalance forklift is a forklift where the driver sits facing the forks, and the counterweight is everything behind the front wheels of the forklift.\n2. Consider how different standard counterbalance forklifts are powered. These forklifts can be powered by anything, from batteries, petrol (gasoline), diesel, LPG/propane gas bottles, and other forms of fuel, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, internal combustion forklifts (petrol, LPG, diesel, etc) are generally faster and have greater lifting capacities than electric/battery-powered forklifts. However, for health and safety reasons, combustion forklifts cannot be used in confined spaces (e.g. shipping containers, small warehouses, etc) due to the exhaust gasses produced when in operation.\n3. Be familiar with how many wheels standard counterbalance forklifts have. They can be either 4-wheeled or 3-wheeled; two wheels at the front and one at the back allows for greater maneuverability, at the expense of stability. This is why 4-wheeled forklifts are usually more common, as they generally still have more than enough maneuverability for most applications in small spaces.\n\n\n## Identify warehouse forklifts\n\n1. Get to know reach forklifts. Designed for usage for indoors and on flat surfaces, reach forklifts (also known as high-reach forklifts) are named for their ability to reach high racking. (up to 12 metres (39ft) or more!!!) Depending on the forklift manufacturer, the reaching mechanism may be a moving mast type, or a moving forks and carriage type. Reach forklifts generally have lifting capacities of 1 ton to 2.5 tons. Lifting capacities above 2.5 ton are generally very rare due to many factors such as narrow aisle space and keeping the forklift compact (a stronger forklift must be larger and therefore unable to operate in narrow aisles) and also generally due to most loads in warehousing to be put in aisle racking usually just do not weigh more than 1- 2 tons. Reach forklifts drive differently, compared to counterbalance forklifts because the operator sits (or stands, depending on the model) sideways on the forklift. Reach forklifts are designed for narrow warehouse aisle use; the operator is able to look forward or backward without the neck strain of having to turn around. This sideways operator position, alongside with reversed steering controls, makes reach forklifts considerably challenging for a new operator to learn.\n2. Know what double deep reach forklifts are. Double deep reach forklifts are very similar to reach forklifts. However, as the name suggests, they are able to retrieve/put away pallets that are stored in double deep racking, which are pallets that are stored one in front of each other in specially designed racks.\n3. Familiarize yourself with order picker forklifts. Although an order picker forklift is considered a type of forklift, it is not used for regular forklift operations. Order picker forklifts require the operator to wear a harness and stand while operating, as they are used for lifting pallets alongside with the operator up into the air. The operator then typically picks up individual units of a product to manually stack on a pallet to \"pick\" an warehouse order; this is opposed to regular order picking, where workers can only pick products from ground level. An order picker forklift can allow operators to pick products quickly and efficiently at any level in the air.\n4. Recognize the disadvantages of picker forklifts. The only main disadvantage of them is that they must be operated on flat ground, and they cannot be operated on slopes or uneven ground; they are top heavy, and this increases the risk of tip overs.\n\n\n## Identify big forklifts\n\n1. Know what a heavy duty forklift is. A heavy duty forklift is an umbrella term used to describe a counterbalance forklift with a high lifting capacity. Most standard counterbalance forklifts in warehouses and manufacturing plants will only have a lifting capacity of 1-3 tons, whereas heavy duty forklifts have a lifting capacity of 5 - 50+ tons!\n2. Understand how heavy duty forklifts operate. All heavy duty forklifts will require significant space to be able to maneuver around. The higher the lifting capacity the forklift has, the larger the rear end (counterweight) of the forklift will need to be. The vast majority of heavy duty forklifts will be powered by diesel fuel, though some lower end heavy duty forklifts (with lifting capacities up to 8-10 tons) may still be powered by LPG/propane gas bottles or petrol fuel.While It is generally very uncommon to encounter battery powered heavy duty forklifts, a few forklift companies have recently started to offer them up to the 20 ton range.\n3. Learn about container handling forklifts. Container handling forklifts generally come in two types: Laden and Unladen (i.e. for handling full or empty containers, respectively). Laden container handling forklifts are usually capable of stacking full shipping containers 4-5 high, with lifting capacities ranging from 35-50 tons. Unladen container handling forklifts are able to stack as high as 8 or 9 shipping containers high, but with a lifting capacity of only 7-10 tons (empty shipping containers generally only weigh 3-5 tons). For these reasons, an unladen container handling forklift cannot be used for handling laden shipping containers, as it will be extremely overloaded. (full shipping containers can weigh anywhere from 10-30 tons).\n4. Learn about reach stackers. Reach stackers are technically not forklifts at all; as they do not have a mast or forks to lift loads, instead, they operate with a heavy duty boom that extends from the rear to the front of the reach stacker, and they lift shipping containers using a container handling attachment. Reach stackers often are highly sophisticated machines with on-board computers and other technologies. Their load capacity usually ranges from 40-50 tons. However, due to the extending boom feature, overloading is still possible.\n\n\n## Identify specialist forklifts\n\n1. Learn about Articulated VNA Forklifts. Pictured here, Articulated VNA (Very Narrow Aisle) Forklifts are generally known as \"Bendi\" or \"Flexi\" Forklifts. Articulated Forklifts are special types of forklifts which are articulated from the front end (wheels, mast, and forks and carriage) so that they are able to perform both duties of a counterbalance forklift (loading trucks) and a reach forklift (retrieve/put away stock in narrow aisles). Another variation of the articulated forklift is the \"Turret truck\" also known as the \"Man-up forklift\", named so, as much like an order picker forklift, turret truck forklifts lift the operator high up in the air along with the forks. Much like \"bendi\" articulated forklifts, turret trucks allow for maximized warehouse storage space by greatly reducing the aisle widths - however unlike bendi forklifts, turret trucks cannot be operated outside, on slopes or on uneven ground, similar as order picking forklifts.\n2. Identify an all terrain forklift. Generally similar in operation to standard counterbalance forklifts, the main difference is All terrain forklifts usually have large trodden tires, for use on all terrain ground, dirt, mud, grass, etc, where regular solid forklift tires would simply not operate on the ground - they would have no traction and get \"bogged\". All terrain forklifts are generally best identified by the large trodden tires and a similar appearance to a small tractor.\n3. Learn about side loaders. A side loader, or multi-directional forklift, is a specialist type of forklift used mainly for the moving of long shaped loads, such as timber, piping, etc. Its main feature is it is able to be driven in different directions; for example, it can be driven sideways after retrieving a long load from an aisle - which greatly eases the process of getting long loads in and out of racking storage - as opposed to turning a full 90 degrees with standard forklifts, a maneuvering problem exacerbated by long shaped loads.\n4. Learn about telehandler forklifts. Similar in design to reach stackers, telehandler forklifts are a specialist type of forklift common in the construction industry, the use of a boom with the forks and carriage on the end allows the handling of loads to places standard mast type forklifts cannot reach, for example on a rooftop, in the middle of a large trailer, etc. Again with the boom extension care needs to be taken as lifting capacity can be significantly reduced.\n5. Understand truck mounted forklifts. Truck mounted forklifts, also known as \"donkey forklifts\", are just as their name suggests. They are a small type of forklift that can be easily mounted on the back of a truck for transport, and easily taken off for use of loading or unloading the trucks on-site. These forklifts are generally built to be lightweight and very simple to operate, thus lifting capacities and lift heights are generally very low. Essentially they are used for lifting small loads on and off trucks, unless they are otherwise specially designed to perform other functions.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual with an interest in renewable energy and home sustainability.

This is especially true when you're trying to be a good friend and tasked with investigating the true feelings of a friend's crush. With some intuition and old-fashioned honesty, you can make the complicated game of love a little bit easier.\n\n## Make honesty work\n\n1. Be up front. The easiest and most effective way is to just ask your friend's crush about their feelings. If you're having trouble working up the courage to ask such a personal question, there's a few ways to make the process easier. Consider the time and place you're going to have the conversation. Make sure the crush is in a comfortable area, probably out of earshot from anyone who could listen in. Be gentle. Don't use confrontational lines, such as \"Everyone knows you like Ryan. Just come out and say it!\" Instead, you might say \"You seem really happy around Ryan. Do you think you might have feelings for him?\" Don't pry too much if they seem uncomfortable. If the crush seems to get embarrassed during your conversation, back off a bit. They may need time before they're willing to divulge such sensitive feelings.\n2. Ask about their love life. Instead of asking the crush directly about your friend, try starting with their love life in general. Ask to see if they're dating anyone or if they're currently looking to find a love interest.\n3. Ask about your friend in a platonic way. Ask your friend's crush less leading questions about your friend, and see if they naturally bring up their potential attraction. Try questions such as, \"So how did you and Cayla meet?\" or \"How long have you known each other?\"\n\n\n## Spot a flirt\n\n1. Examine body language. People give off noticeable changes in their movements when they feel attracted to someone. While everyone has their own set of bodily cues, there are some common signs to look out for when someone's crushing. Open postures such as uncrossed legs, open arms, and palms facing up. People will often lean in much closer to a crush when speaking with them in comparison to the personal space they use with platonic friends. Sometimes people will play with their hair, jewelry, or will simply make extended eye contact and smile during their conversations with crushes.\n2. Watch for eye contact. Prolonged eye contact, even for just over a second, is a common sign of either aggression or romantic interest. Pay close attention to how long your friend's crush gazes at your buddy. If they fail to maintain consistent eye contact, then it could be a bad sign for any hopes of a relationship. On the contrary, it's an excellent signal of affection if they constantly stay locked onto each other's eyes during conversations.\n3. Look at their social media communication. See if your friend's crush interacts with your friend frequently on social media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Pay attention to the language they use with your friend, and see if they use obvious signs such as smiley face or winky face emojis.\n4. Look for compliments. People looking to give off signs of attraction will likely dole out many compliments to their crush. Watch to see if your friend's crush praises them on their talents or academic accomplishments. It's important to note that being complimentary isn't always a sign of affection, so it's crucial to pay attention to the frequency of their praise and admiration. Compliments on physical features are an especially key sign of flirting. Did your friend's crush notice their new glasses, haircut, or workout routine? Flirts tend to notice these subtle changes and point them out to convey affection. Sexual innuendos laced in jokes and conversations can also be not-so-subtle signs of a flirt's desire to spice up conversations with the person of their desire.\n5. Listen for references on their availability. Flirts will commonly drop hints in conversations that reflect their relationship status, such as mentioning they're recently single or how lonely they've been.\n6. Understand different kinds of flirts. Some people may flirt very openly and little guessing is required, while others can be introverted flirts with more subtle signs of affection. Physical flirts rely on body language cues to convey their feelings. They often use physical signs of affection before verbal cues, such as eye contact and playful touching. Traditional flirts tend to be more polite, preferring to convey affection over a longer period of time instead of using flashy and overt statements such as saying they're single or rubbing their crush's arm. These flirts also prefer professional environments like bookstores or study groups to build relationships over parties. Playful flirts use very clear signs of affection in a boisterous manner. For example, they may joke excessively in a sexual way with their crush or make bold physical complements about their crush's appearance.\n7. Talk to your crush's friends. Find out who your crush's friends are and ask around to see if what the status of the crush's feelings are. Chances are if the crush is significant the word has already made its way around to people.\n\n\n## Give your friend confidence\n\n1. Give them affirmations. Another solution is to give your friend enough confidence ask their crush directly so you don't have to do the leg work. Discreetly feed your friend affirmations such as, \"Everyone knows how confident you are, why not put it to use and ask Nicki how she feels?\" Congratulate them on little steps, such as starting small talk with their crush or asking them for help with some schoolwork. Give them support even when they falter. If they lose their nerve to talk to their crush at a party, let them know it's okay to be afraid sometimes and that there will be other opportunities to develop a relationship.\n2. Help them improve. If they feel uncomfortable with their body or lifestyle, start supporting healthy habits. Go to the gym with your friend, sign up for yoga classes, or start up a diet together.\n3. Listen to their concerns. Sometimes people can gain confidence just by airing out their insecurities. Ask them why they feel uncomfortable confronting their crush, and let them know it's normal to feel anxiety about such an important question.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A young adult or teenage individual who is navigating the complexities of friendship and romantic relationships.

{"conversations": ["How to control chi?", "Chi (also known as \u201cQi\u201d and pronounced \u201cchee\u201d) is a concept that comes from Chinese medicine. Chi is life energy, which is believed to be in everything and everyone in the world. Many people wish to spend time focusing their chi because it is believe to improve health, focus, and well-being. Learning to focus your chi will be an on-going journey.\n\n## Focus chi through movement\n\n1. Practice Tai Chi. Tai Chi can help you with focusing your Chi. It is a light exercise that uses several movements and breathing to help you focus on your Chi. It is believed to help reduce stress and help with many medical conditions.\n2. Find Tai Chi classes. There are many videos for practicing Tai Chi on the web. Simply search for \u201cTai Chi videos\u201d on your favorite search engine. However, if you have never practiced any Tai Chi before, it is perhaps a good idea to visit a Tai Chi instructor to help get you started. You can also call local gyms and yoga studios to see which ones offer Tai Chi classes.\n3. Try out some of the basic movements. If you aren\u2019t sure whether you would like Tai Chi, or if you feel intimidated to go to a class, you can try out a few of the basic movements first. Begin with your feet at shoulder width. This helps you keep your weight centered. Keep in mind that when practicing Tai Chi, it is extremely important to keep you weight balanced on both of your feet, which when planted on the ground, should stay shoulder width apart. Keep your knees slightly bent. Don\u2019t lock them! Try to position yourself as if you were about to sit down into a chair, which will require your muscles in your legs to engage. Keep your spine straight, but also relaxed. Imagine that each vertebra is floating above the one below it. Touch your tongue to the roof of the mouth gently. This is believed to connect the channels which help chi flow. Thus connecting your entire body. Make a mental connection. This involves mentally thinking about connecting the wrists and ankles, elbows and knees, shoulders with hips. Become aware of your breath. Breathe in a relaxed, normal manner. Follow the inhalation and exhalation, as well as expanding and contraction of your lungs. If you can, belly breathe.\n4. Be present while practicing. Being present in the moment (rather than constantly thinking about the past or worrying about the future) plays a huge role in Eastern Philosophy. This means that when you are practicing Tai Chi (and in your daily life in general) you should also practice being mindful, or fully present, in the moment. In the case of Tai Chi, you should practice noticing physical and emotional sensations you feel while you are actively practicing. Naturally, your mind may wander. In these instance, you should simply try to notice extraneous thoughts that come into your mind, and then go back to noticing the feelings and sensations you are currently experience. Don\u2019t judge the thought, and try not to follow it.\n5. Keep practicing! The idea behind Tai Chi (and focusing and developing your Chi in general, is that you are on a journey. Thus, if you really want to use Tai Chi as a method of focusing your Chi, you should practice consistently. You may find benefit if you practice every day for a month, but you will find even more benefit if you practice a few times a week for many years.\n\n\n## Use chi breathe exercise\n\n1. Practice mindfulness when practicing these breathing exercises. The term \u201cmindfulness\u201d refers to a practice of making a gentle effort to be present in whatever you are currently doing. In this case, this means making an effort to think about the exercise as you are doing it. Think about the way the breath feels as you inhale and exhale. Although your mind will very likely wander to other thoughts, worries, and/or other things you have to get done, just do your best to come back to the present when you notice that it has wandered. Don\u2019t get mad at yourself when this happens.\n2. Find a comfortable position. This will be different for everyone. If you find that you are comfortable sitting cross-legged on the floor, do that. If you want to lay down or even stand up, that is fine too. Make sure your clothes are comfortable, and that you are sitting with good posture. Inhale through your nose. Do this as you normally would, don\u2019t make it deeper or more shallow. Exhale slowly. Instead of out your nose, exhale out of your mouth as much as you can. Try to get all of the air out of your lungs. Breathe in through your nose. You will find this very refreshing as their was no air in your lungs, but try to breathe normally. Don\u2019t take a very deep breath, but instead take a breath as you normally would. Repeat the process of inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. Do this as many times as you like. It will help refresh you and make you more alert. However, if you feel dizzy, try taking a break or making your exhalations slower.\n3. Practice belly breathing. In Eastern medicine it is believed that breathing low in the belly is better than using the shoulders to breathe. Lie down on your back. Once you get the hang of it, you will be able to do this no matter whether you are sitting, laying down, or standing. However, it\u2019s good to start in this position so you know how it should feel. Rest one of your hands low on your belly, beneath your belly button with a flat, open hand. Take a few normal breaths to relax. Take a deep breath, and then forcefully exhale. The point here is to try and push your hand up with your belly during the exhalation. Your hips and back should not move. Repeat this step until you get the hang of moving your hand using only your breathing.\n4. Breathe in a square. This may sound strange, but it will help you to experience what chi feels like. It involves breaking your inhalation and exhalation down into 4 parts. Begin by sitting in a peaceful, relaxed position. If you choose to sit up, make sure you have good posture. Take a few breaths to relax. If you have mastered belly breathing, then do that. However, if you have not, just breathe normally for a few breaths to relax. Choose an amount of time for your breaths. A good place to start is 5 seconds for inhalation and 5 seconds for exhalation. You can add or subtract time from this if you need. Breathe in for the amount of time you have chosen (i.e. 5 seconds), then spend 5 seconds without inhaling or exhaling (don\u2019t tense up your body here!). Follow this with 5 seconds of slowly exhaling, and another 5 seconds where you stop exhaling and don\u2019t inhale either. Focus on the experience of continually breathing in a square. The feeling you get from this is chi.\n\n\n## Focus chi through meditation\n\n1. Search for videos or apps. If you have never practiced meditation before, you can search the web for videos or for apps for your smart phone that can guide you through a meditation session. If you choose to use a video to guide you, skim through several videos to see if you enjoy the tempo of the guidance, the length, and the content of the guidance. You don\u2019t have to listen to the whole thing before you start, but try to look for a guided meditation for beginners as these will be much shorter and include much more verbal guidance.\n2. Avoid eating for at least half an hour before meditating. A full belly can make you sleepy and weigh you down. When meditating, you want to be awake, but relaxed.\n3. Find a quiet place to meditate. If you can find a nearly silent place to meditate, this is best. If you wish, you can use music to help you focus in your meditation. However, be sure to use music that is suitable for Chi meditation. If you don\u2019t have any such music, you can search sites like YouTube for videos that play the correct music. Simply search for \u201cChi meditation music\u201d (or try \u201cQi meditation music\u201d), and you should find suitable music.\n4. Find a comfortable, seated position. If you can, sit cross-legged on the floor. If this is not possible for you, sit upright in a chair with your feet planted flat on the floor.\n5. Rest your hands lightly on your lap. Your hands should rest with your palms facing upwards either on each leg or with your left hand cradling your right hand just below your navel. If you choose the latter, have your thumbs gently touching each other.\n6. Keep your spine straight. This can be challenging at first, but try not to slouch. Instead, practice sitting with your spine straight. While you should try to keep your spine straight, you should not feel tense. Thus, try to keep a straight, but relaxed position.\n7. Relax your gaze. You can choose to gently close your eyes, or keep your eyes open. Either way, begin by resting your gaze in front of you, not focusing too hard on anything in particular.\n8. Become aware of your physical and emotional feelings. Notice the way your body feels as it rests on the floor or chair, and take note of the thoughts and emotions you are feeling at this moment.\n9. Become aware of your breathing. Notice your breathe. Notice the way it feels as you inhale in through the nose (e.g. Is the air cold? Is one nostril more open than the other?) and then notice how it feels as you exhale (e.g. Is the air warmer? Does the air come out slowly or forcefully?). As you breathe in, imagine that you are breathing in good energy. As you breathe out, imagine that you are breathing out toxins and bad energy.\n10. Practice meditation every single day. With meditation it is best to practice every day if at all possible. This may mean that you have to reduce the time that you meditate, which is OK. It is better to meditate for 10 minutes each day than for 30 or 40 minutes only once per week.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A practitioner of Feng Shui, seeking guidance on techniques for balancing and harmonizing the energy flow (chi) within a living or working space to promote positive energy and well-being.

{"conversations": ["How to be organized during the holidays?", "## Personal holiday organization\n\n1. Plan for sleep. One of the dangers of the holiday season is that you schedule too much and don't budget enough time for sleep and exercise. These 2 practices can cut your stress level in half and make it easier to stay on task during your holiday rush. It is common to reduce your exercise time slightly during the holidays, but try to get about 30 minutes of mid-intensity cardiovascular exercise 5 times per week. Don't not cut down on your sleep; aim for 8 hours per night. Moderate your alcohol intake. Although it may seem like a sedative, it can actually prevent you from getting deep sleep. Stop after a few drinks to avoid losing your energy the next day.\n2. Set a budget 2 months before the holidays. Take into account how much you can afford and then split the money between cards, postage stamps, gifts, decorations, clothing, food and even a party. Plan an overage of 10 percent in your budget. This means all of your needs should add up to 90 percent of the money you have for the holidays.\n3. Sit down with your family 6 weeks before the holiday and ask for help. If you love control, this may be hard to do; however, it will take a load off your shoulders and make everyone feel like the holidays don't come together magically.\n4. Discuss the possibility of doing a low-gift giving Christmas or a charity project with your family. If your budget is tight, then giving 1 present or buying 1 big present for the whole family might be better. Studies have also shown that charity projects can help your emotional health during stressful times.\n5. Book travel plans 3 or more months before the holidays. Ticket prices tend to go up right before the holidays. Make sure you have lower travel costs and less stress associated with travel if you and your children or parents have their plans figured out in advance.\n6. Use a calendar that everyone can see, online or in the house. Place all commitments, deadlines, family nights and tasks on it so that everyone can refer back to it over the month of December.\n\n\n## Holiday shop organization\n\n1. Schedule shopping intelligently rather than in blocks. The following are good tips that make holiday shopping more effective and quick:\n\t* Buy things throughout the year, whenever you see something that is ideal for someone. You provide more thoughtful gifts if they are catered to the person, rather than bought frantically the month before. Store your gifts in 1 place in your house and come back to your gift hiding place 6 weeks before Chanukah or Christmas. Take a few hours off work during mid-week once the holiday sales start. You will miss the rush and have a more calm shopping experience. Shop in small spurts online. Getting online for hours can be a waste of time. Keep a list in your purse of things you are looking for, and add to it. Wait until you have 2 or 3 things you know you want to search for and do your power shopping. Open 3 browser tabs and compare prices on Amazon, Overtock.com and a Google Shopping page. Don't be afraid to give gift certificates. Many stores, massage parlors, movie theaters and more provide gift certificates. Think of something that your friends or family will find truly valuable over a product you are unsure they will like.\n2. Set up a wrapping station on a table in late November or early December. Wrap gifts as soon as you bring them home. This will remove the chance that children will find their gifts and it will allow you to get both shopping and wrapping done at a slow and steady pace.\n3. Aim to finish your shopping and wrapping by December 15th. Schedule your time accordingly, so that you can enjoy the holidays and be ready for any last-minute changes.\n\n\n## Holiday cook organization\n\n1. Clean your kitchen from top to bottom before attempting holiday baking or cooking. Try to do this in late November or early December. Rearrange things that overnight guests will need, such as coffee and cereal, in an easy to reach cupboard and create a baking cupboard.\n2. Stock up on baking supplies early in the season. Buy flour, sugar and spices at warehouse stores so that you don't have to make late night runs to the supermarket. Buy some pre-made pie crusts and cookies to keep around in case you don't have time to do everything from scratch.\n3. Bake throughout the holiday season. Clear out your freezer, and then create a cooking to do list that allows you to make and freeze items every week. For example, bake 1 sweet, such as cookies or candy, and prepare 1 side dish in preparation. Cover and label the dishes very well before you stack them on a freezer. For example, \"Sweet Potatoes. Thaw and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.\"\n4. Plan a holiday potluck party instead of baking all of the food. This is a great way to lower your budget and have fun.

{"conversations": ["How to cook corn?", "There are many different yet simple ways to cook corn. Corn on the cob can be boiled, microwaved, grilled, steamed, or baked, while loose kernel corn is usually boiled, steamed, or microwaved. Keep reading to learn more about your preferred cooking method.\n\n## Boiling corn on the cob[1]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Boil a large stockpot of water. Meanwhile, prepare the corn cobs by removing the husks and silks. The exact amount of water you need will vary depending on how large each ear of corn is. Make sure that you use enough water to completely cover the ears of corn once they are submerged. Note that you can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) salt to the water if desired, but it is not needed. To remove the husks, snap off the stem of the corn with your hands. Pull the stem over the length of the corn to peel off the husks still attached to it. Remove the remaining husks by peeling them off with your fingers. Rinse the husk-free corn cobs under running water. Rub your hands over the corn to loose and free as many of the silky threads you spot clinging to the corn.\n2. Transfer the corn to the boiling water. Cover the pot and let it return to boiling. Use tongs to dunk the corn into the water. Avoid using your hands to transfer the corn since doing so may result in burns. If the boiling slows or stops after you place the corn in the stockpot, allow the water to reach a boiling point again before timing the cooking process.\n3. Cook for 3 to 8 minutes. The corn should be \"tender-crisp\" when done. \"Tender-crisp\" means that the corn is soft enough to press, but not mushy. The precise amount of cooking time will vary based on the type of corn and how mature it is. Fresh corn and sweet corn usually cook fastest.\n4. Remove and serve. Transfer the ears of corn to a layer of clean paper towels and let drain for 30 to 60 seconds before serving. The corn will be hot, so you may want to wait a few minutes before biting into it. Corn is usually served with a drizzle of butter.\n\n\n## Microwaving corn on the cob[2]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Place an ear of corn in a microwave-safe dish. You will need to cook the corn one ear at a time, but the instructions are the same for each ear. Do not remove the husk. The corn will cook better in the microwave if left in the husk during the cooking process.\n2. Microwave the corn for 5 minutes. The microwave should be set on high power or full power. Let stand in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes to avoid burning yourself with the steam.\n3. Transfer the corn to a cutting board. Cut of the stem end using a sharp kitchen knife. Use oven mitts or a towel when removing the corn from the microwave. As you cut, you should also remove the first row of kernels. Make sure to cut through the husk completely.\n4. Slip the corn out of its husk and serve. Use oven mitts or a towel to grab hold of the corn from the uncut top end. Gently shake the ear, allowing the corn to slip free. The ear of corn should slip out of the husk easily. Usually, even the silks will remain left behind inside the husks. You can serve the corn with butter and salt, or however you prefer it.\n\n\n## Grilling corn on the cob\n\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Meanwhile, remove the husks and silks from your ears of corn. If using a gas grill, set all the burners to medium-high heat and allow the grill to preheat for 5 to 10 minutes. If using a charcoal grill, allow a thick layer of coals to burn until white ash begins to form over the surface. Husk the corn by snapping off the stem and pulling it over the length of the corn, thereby removing the husk attached to the stem. Peel away the rest of the husk with your fingers. Rinse the ears under running water to remove most of the loose silks.\n2. Brush the corn with olive oil. Use a basting brush to apply a thin coat of olive oil to the surface of each ear of corn. Use no more than 1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil per ear. You could also use melted butter instead of olive oil.\n3. Transfer the corn to the grill. Cook for 6 to 10 minutes. Turn the corn occasionally to ensure even cooking and prevent burning. The corn is done once the majority of the kernels begin to brown lightly. It will also be charred in some spots, especially near the smaller kernels.\n4. Serve as desired. Remove the corn from the grill and transfer each ear to a serving platter. Let cool until you can handle it comfortably with your bare hands. Butter and salt are frequently served with corn, but if you used butter on the corn before grilling it, you may find that you do not need to add more.\n\n\n## Steaming corn on the cob[3]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Boil water in the bottom portion of a steamer. Husk and de-silk the ears of corn as you wait. If you do not have an actual steamer, you can use a large stockpot and perforated metal colander instead. Make sure that the metal colander can rest on the lip of the stockpot before attempting to use it, however. The basket portion of the colander should not dip below the halfway point of the stockpot. Snap off the stem of the corn and pull it over the length of the ear, removing the attached husk. Peel the rest of the husk away with your fingers. Rinse the corn under cool running water, scrubbing it gently with your hands. This should remove the majority of the silks.\n2. Transfer the corn to the steaming basket. Cook for 8 to 12 minutes. Use tongs to transfer the corn into the steaming basket. Using your hands could result in burns. The exact cooking time will vary depending on how mature the corn is. Fresher corn cooks quicker than older corn. The corn is done once the kernels feel tender but not mushy.\n3. Serve warm. Remove the corn from the steamer with your tongs and let rest for a minute or two before enjoying. Season with butter and salt, if desired.\n\n\n## Baking corn on the cob[4]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius). Remove the husks and silks from each ear of corn as the oven preheats. To remove the husk from an ear of corn, snap off the stem using your hands. Pull the broken stem down over the ear, stripping away any husk attached to it. Peel the rest of the exposed husk away with your fingers. Rinse each corn cob under running water, scrubbing gently with your hands to remove any visible silks. Pat dry with paper towels.\n2. Season the ears with butter. You can also add a little salt and pepper, if desired. Use plenty of butter. Spread at least 1 to 2 Tbsp of melted butter over each ear.\n3. Wrap each ear in aluminum foil. Each ear must be completely wrapped inside its own sheet of aluminum foil. If you are worried about butter leaking out from the aluminum foil, place a flat baking sheet or jelly-roll pan beneath the wrapped ears of corn to catch any dripping butter.\n4. Bake the corn for 20 to 30 minutes. Most ears of corn will only take 20 minutes to cook, but larger ears may need as many as 30 minutes. Place the corn on the middle rack of your oven to ensure the most even cooking.\n5. Remove and serve. Let the cooked ears of corn rest for 2 to 5 minutes before carefully removing the aluminum foil. Serve once they are cool enough to touch.\n\n\n## Boiling corn kernels\n\n1. Boil water in a medium saucepan. Meanwhile, measure out your frozen whole corn kernels. You can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) of salt to the boiling water, if desired, but the salt is not necessary. The corn does not need to be thawed prior to use. You could also use canned corn kernels instead of frozen corn. Note that the amount of time needed to boil canned corn is significantly less than the amount of time needed to boil frozen corn. Additionally, canned corn should be drained before you add it to the boiling water.\n2. Add the corn to the boiling water. If the boiling decreases or stops, let the water come up to a boil again. After it returns to a rolling boil, reduce the heat to medium-low.\n3. Cover and cook. Frozen whole kernels of corn should simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain once finished. Canned corn should only boil for 1 to 3 minutes. Once finished, the corn should be hot and tender but not mushy.\n4. Serve as desired. Do not refreeze corn kernels after cooking them. If desired, you can mix the cooked corn kernels with butter, salt, and black pepper. You can also use other seasonings, like parsley, according to your own tastes.\n\n\n## Steaming corn kernels\n\n1. Simmer water in a steamer. Fill the lower part of a steamer with water and heat, on the stove, over medium heat until the water steams and starts to simmer. Do not boil the water. Do not fill the steamer high enough for water to slip up through the holes of the steamer basket. If you do not have a steamer, you could use a stockpot and a metal colander with fine holes. Make sure that the colander fits over the lip of the stockpot without falling in.\n2. Add frozen corn kernels into the steamer basket. Spread the kernels out into a single layer. Canned corn kernels can also be used, but they will finish cooking in a much shorter amount of time. They may also be soggier once finished. You do not need to thaw frozen corn kernels before use.\n3. Cook for 9 to 10 minutes. Allow the corn to steam for 9 to 10 minutes without covering it. Drain once finished. Canned kernels will only need to steam for 3 or 4 minutes.\n4. Serve. Steamed corn can be served with butter and salt as well as other seasonings.\n\n\n## Microwaving corn kernels\n\n1. Place corn kernels in a microwave-safe dish. Spread frozen corn kernels into an even layer in the dish. Canned corn kernels can also be used, but there are some differences in the cooking method and length. Frozen corn does not need to be thawed prior to cooking.\n2. Add 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 mL) of water. Stir the water into the corn to disperse it throughout. Note that this step is only needed if using frozen corn kernels. You do not need to add water if using canned corn, but you should not drain the canned corn before use.\n3. Cover the dish with plastic wrap. Use a fork to poke a few holes into the plastic wrap, providing ventilation. Only use plastic wrap that is safe to use in the microwave. If the dish has a cover, you could use that instead of the plastic wrap. Make sure that the cover is placed on the dish loosely so that the corn is still ventilated.\n4. Microwave for 4 to 5 minutes. If using canned corn, only microwave the dish for 1 to 2 minutes. The exact length of time varies depending on how much wattage your microwave has. A lower-powered microwave will need longer time, while a higher-powered microwave will need less time. If you hear popping sounds as the corn cooks, stop the microwave early.\n5. Drain and serve. Drain the cooking liquid from the corn and season as desired with butter, salt, and pepper.\n\n\n## Charcoal grilled corn on the cob\n\n1. Cut the tip of each ear of corn off. Soak the corn in the husks in a sink or a big pot in 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) of tap water for about an hour.\n2. While they're soaking, prepare your outdoor charcoal grill. Add enough coals for an hour of cooking.\n3. Place the corn still in the husks on the grill. Cook for about an hour, turning occasionally, allowing the husks to char.\n4. Remove the husks.\n5. Add butter, salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A curious home cook or a beginner in the kitchen who is seeking guidance on preparing corn dishes.

{"conversations": ["Were there any flying dinosaurs?", "Birds are both flying dinosaurs and flying reptiles. Yes, that's potentially confusing.\n\nTo understand the apparent contradiction, you have to understand how modern classification of organisms works (phylogenetic systematics). Under the old (Linnean) classification system, Reptilia (reptiles) was an order and Aves (birds) was a separate order. Phylogenetic systematics, which has completely replaced the Linnean system, views all organisms as interrelated in a nested set of monophyletic groups (clades). It's like a set of venn diagrams, where all organisms fall into a giant circle and then successively smaller circles classify more and more specific groups.\n\nThe clade Reptilia includes snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and lots of extinct groups, including dinosaurs. So all dinosaurs are reptiles. The clade Dinosauria includes all the extinct dinosaurs (Stegosaurus, Triceratops, sauropods, etc.), including theropod dinosaurs, which include well known dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus. Based on a mountain on anatomical evidence, including lots of transitional fossils, living birds are a sub-group of theropod dinosaurs.\n\nSo all birds (Aves) are theropod dinosaurs (Dinosauria: Theropoda). All dinosaurs are reptiles. Therefore, birds are dinosaurs and reptiles. They are just more closely related to dinosaurs than to other reptiles.\nThe tricky part is that most people have an intuitive idea of what \"reptiles\" and \"dinosaurs\" are. To a systematist, whose job it is to classify organisms, these terms don't mean the same thing as they do to most people. Systematists think about groups like Reptilia and Dinosauria and how those groups are related to one another. So they have no problem saying that birds are dinosaurs and reptiles, because birds are nested within both of those groups.\n\nA few words about pterosaurs\nAlong with birds and bats, pterosaurs are the other clade of vertebrates capable of powered, flapping flight. Pterosaurs fall within Reptilia (and Diapsida and Archosauria) along with Dinosauria, which includes birds. There are a lot of other extinct lineages in the tree that are not shown, e.g., ornithodirans that are not dinosaurs and not pterosaurs. Pterosaurs and birds share anatomical features that all reptiles, diapsids, archosaurs, and ornithodirans have, which is how we know that they are more closely related to each other than to other groups, like crocodiles. But their flight structures evolved independently and are anatomically distinct fro one another. So pterosaurs are flying reptiles but not flying dinosaurs.\nThese images might help you understand the above explanation."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A health-conscious individual, possibly a nutritionist, dietitian, or a person with a strong interest in health and wellness.

Also after generating those points, what is the best way to visualize and check whether they are truly uniform on the surface $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$?", "A standard method is to generate three standard normals and construct a unit vector from them. That is, when $X_i \\sim N(0,1)$ and $\\lambda^2 = X_1^2 + X_2^2 + X_3^2$, then $(X_1/\\lambda, X_2/\\lambda, X_3/\\lambda)$ is uniformly distributed on the sphere.  This method works well for $d$-dimensional spheres, too.\nIn 3D you can use rejection sampling: draw $X_i$ from a uniform$[-1,1]$ distribution until the length of $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ is less than or equal to 1, then--just as with the preceding method--normalize the vector to unit length.  The expected number of trials per spherical point equals $2^3/(4 \\pi / 3)$ = 1.91.  In higher dimensions the expected number of trials gets so large this rapidly becomes impracticable.\nThere are many ways to check uniformity.  A neat way, although somewhat computationally intensive, is with Ripley's K function.  The expected number of points within (3D Euclidean) distance $\\rho$ of any location on the sphere is proportional to the area of the sphere within distance $\\rho$, which equals $\\pi\\rho^2$.

{"conversations": ["How to identify ticks?", "While tick bites are not often painful, they can lead to infections or even chronic illnesses like Lyme disease. If you're uncertain whether you're dealing with a tick infestation, check for defining features that distinguish a tick from other bugs. Some bugs that look like ticks are harmless, but ticks must be dealt with immediately to avoid illness or infection. Call an exterminator if you're still not sure for a professional opinion.\n\n## Check for distinctive tick feature\n\n1. Look for a round, ovular shape. Before a tick is engorged with blood, its body is shaped like an oval with 2 major segments. After a tick is engorged, its head will remain small but its body will grow round and plump.\n2. Check for bugs that are between \u20442 to 2 in (1.3 to 5.1 cm) long. How large a tick is when you find it depends on whether it has recently fed on blood. Before it has drunk any blood, a tick will be around the size of a pinhead. Immediately to several hours afterward, a tick will grow to around the size of a lima bean.\n3. Examine its exterior for a protective hard body. In most cases, ticks have a hard exoskeleton. These are called hard or \"authentic\" ticks and are usually what people are talking about when describing ticks. Soft ticks with a flexible exoskeleton exist but are only found in select areas. Soft ticks are found in the western United States and southwestern Canada.\n4. Check for a star-shaped design on its back. Lone star ticks have a white, star-shaped design on their exoskeletons. If a bug does not have this design, it still may be a tick. This pattern is just a defining feature of this tick species.\n5. Examine the bug for black legs. Black-legged ticks, as suggested by their name, have legs that are darker than their bodies. Like a lone star tick's black legs, this is a defining characteristic of black-legged ticks and may not be present on every tick.\n\n\n## Differentiate between tick and other bug\n\n1. Avoid mistaking bugs with wings or antennae for ticks. Ticks do not have wings, nor do they have antennae. If you have found a bug with either, it is not a tick. Research bugs with similar characteristics to ticks but with wings or antennae if your bug in question has these. Poplar weevils, which are commonly mistaken for ticks, have both wings and antennae.\n2. Count the number of legs to distinguish it from insects. Because ticks are a type of arachnid, like spiders and scorpions, they have 8 legs. If your bug has 6, it is an insect and therefore not a tick. If your bug has less than 6 or more than 8 legs, it is neither an insect nor arachnid but is, regardless, not a tick.\n3. Watch for bugs that feed on blood and do not travel in groups. Billbugs are the commonly mistaken for ticks because of their near-identical appearance. The way to distinguish between a tick and a billbug is to watch them. Billbugs swarm in groups, whereas ticks are usually alone. Ticks also feed on blood, whereas billbugs do not. As a general rule, billbugs do not hang around or on people and animals. Ticks often do.\n4. Look for bugs that burrow in the skin instead of resting on its surface. Both ticks and bed bugs hang around animals and humans. Their method of feeding off of people and animals, however, differs. Ticks burrow into the skin to drink a living creature's blood but bed bugs stay on the skin's surface. Make sure you know whether a bug is a tick or bed bug before removing it from your skin. Without proper precautions, you may remove a tick's body while its head remains lodged in your skin.\n\n\n## Identify tick bite\n\n1. Check for mild pain around the bite. Tick bites are not usually painful. If you experience sharp pain, you have not likely been bitten by a tick. Research your other symptoms to determine what insect or arachnid bit you and begin treatment. If a soft tick bites you, you might notice localized pain immediately after the tick drops off.\n2. Inspect the site for redness. Although tick bites are not painful, they can still set off your body's immune system. If the bite and the skin surrounding it looks reddish, it may be a tick bite. Keep in mind, however, that redness is a symptom of many bug bites.\n3. Watch for rash development in the days and weeks following your bite. While not often a symptom of tick bites, you may develop a rash if your tick bite becomes infected or if you contracted an illness from the tick bite. If a rash spreads from your tick bite to other parts of your body, call your doctor or visit an urgent care clinic. Some illnesses that ticks carry, like Lyme disease, can take months or years before symptoms develop.\n4. Look for a tick still attached to your body. Because tick bites usually do not hurt, the most common way to spot a tick bite is to see the tick burrowed in your skin. Compare the bug on your body to other insects before removing it so you can use a pair of tweezers or a credit card to safely get it out of your skin. If you are not careful, tick heads can remain lodged in your skin.\n5. Recognize tick bite symptoms that require immediate medical care. While most tick bites can be treated at home, you may need emergency care if you develop an infection or allergic reaction. Seek emergency medical help immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms:\n\t* Raised red bumps (hives) all over your body\n\t* Trouble breathing\n\t* Swelling of the mouth, lips, tongue, or throat\n\t* Lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual who is concerned about their health and outdoor activities, such as hikers, campers, or gardeners.

{"conversations": ["How to hold your breath for long periods of time?", "The ability to hold your breath for a long period of time is a much sought-after skill. Maybe you want to last longer underwater while diving or surfing, or maybe you're just looking for an impressive party trick. Whatever the reason, it is actually surprisingly easy to increase the amount of time you can go without breathing, provided you use the right training techniques and follow adequate safety precautions. Read below to find out how.\n\n## Optimize your lung capacity\n\n1. Do exercises to increase your lung capacity. While there is no way to increase your lung size, there are many ways to increase the amount of air your lungs take in, and the efficiency with which they capture oxygen. In particular, a rigorous exercise routine can help to strengthen your lungs and maximize their capacity to hold air. Do plenty of cardio. Incorporating some intense cardio workouts into your weekly routine can do wonders for your lungs. Running, skipping, aerobics and swimming are all great forms of cardiovascular exercise which get the blood pumping and the lungs working hard to supply the body with the oxygen it needs to keep going. Try doing exercising in intense 30 minute bursts, pushing your body to its limits, to achieve the best result. Exercise in water. Exercising in water (swimming, water aerobics, underwater weight training) is also a form of cardio exercise, but the water provides an element of resistance which requires the body to work harder to complete each task. As a result, the lungs need to work harder to supply the body with oxygen, causing their air capacity to increase significantly over time. Work-out at high elevation. At higher elevations, there is less oxygen in the air, meaning your lungs have to work harder to supply the body with oxygen. This is an excellent way to strengthen the lungs, but you must be careful not to train to hard, or you could potentially fall victim to altitude sickness.\n2. Lose weight. Any excess baggage reduces your body's efficiency in using oxygen, as there is increased body mass to which your blood must pump oxygen. As a result, many competitive breath holders will attempt to shed any extra pounds in the weeks coming up to a competition. This weight loss should be achieved in a strictly healthy way - through exercise and balanced diet - as weakening your body through crash dieting will negatively impact your ability to hold your breath. The world record breath holder, Aleix Segura Vendrell, is reported to have lost weight for 4 months before attempting to beat the world record for holding breath underwater, in an effort to improve his ratio of body volume to lung volume.\n3. Quit smoking. The fact that smoking has a negative impact on lung strength and capacity is common knowledge. Quitting can considerably increase your lungs' ability to release carbon dioxide and absorb oxygen, even within a matter of weeks. So if you are trying to strengthen your lungs and increase their capacity, giving up smoking is undoubtedly the first thing on the to-do list. You should also try to avoid second-hand smoke as far as possible, as inhaling someone else's cigarette smoke can have a negative effect on your lungs.\n4. Take up a wind or brass instrument. These types of instruments require plenty of lung power, making them a great way to improve lung strength and increase your ability to control your breathing. And aside from that, playing an instrument is a fantastic life skill, which can provide immense personal satisfaction. The flute, clarinet, oboe and saxophone are all good options when it comes to wind instruments, while the trumpet, trombone and tuba are popular brass options. If you have a good voice, singing is another great musical aid to improving lung power. Singing requires immense control of one's breathing, making it an excellent complimentary activity for aspiring breath-holders.\n\n\n## Train techniques for hold your breath\n\n1. Practice deep breathing. Before holding your breath, inhale and exhale slowly from deep within your diaphragm. By doing this, you're ridding your lungs of low-quality air. Spend five seconds breathing in, then hold the breath for one second, before breathing out for ten seconds. Continue deep breathing for two minutes, and be sure that when you exhale, you push out every last \"drop\" of air. As you exhale, push your tongue up against your teeth.This forms a valve which helps to control the release of air. Your breath should make a hissing sound as it is released. Deep breathing allows your body to take in excess oxygen, which it can then store in the blood cells. This helps when holding your breath as your body can use the stored oxygen to continue functioning, even when you are not breathing.\n2. Purge the CO2 from your lungs. When holding your breath, the pressure you feel in your lungs is not the result of a need to breathe, but rather the result of a build-up of CO2, fighting to be released. This build-up of CO2 becomes increasingly painful as time goes on. To minimize this build-up, it is necessary to purge any pre-existing CO2 from your lungs, before holding your breath. To do this:\n\t* Exhale forcefully, pushing as much air out of your lungs as possible. Puff out your cheeks as you do this, and imagine you are trying to blow a toy sailboat across a stretch of water. Once you have exhaled completely, inhale quickly and repeat. Try to keep your body as still as possible while you do this, to avoid expending any of the stored oxygen from the previous step.\n3. Take a breath and hold it for one minute and thirty seconds. This is a practice run which will allow your body to adjust to the sensation of going without air. Use a timer to count down the 90 seconds, and don't attempt to hold your breath for any longer just yet. When you inhale, don't breathe in so much that you're about to pop; this creates tension in your body and causes you to expend more energy. Instead, fill your lung capacity to about 80-85% capacity so that you still have room to relax. Once the 90 seconds is up, exhale briefly to rid your lungs of the used air, then take three breaths, inhaling and exhaling fully. This is known as semi-purging.\n4. Repeat the process of deep breathing and purging, then hold your breath for two minutes and thirty seconds. Once the first 90 second practice run is up, repeat the deep breathing and purging exercises. Perform each exercise for a duration of one minute and thirty seconds. Once this is done, take a breath and hold it for two minutes and thirty seconds, timing it on a stopwatch. Do not attempt to hold your breath for any longer than this. Once the time is up, exhale to release the used air and take three semi-purge breaths. Follow this with two minutes of deep breathing and a minute and a half of purging. You are now ready to try holding your breath for as long as possible.\n5. Splash cold water on your face. At this point, you may decide to splash your face with some cold water before attempting to hold your breath. It has been observed that putting a person's face in contact with cold water triggers bradycardia, or the slowing of the heart rate, which is the first phase of the mammalian diving reflex. However, this step is purely optional. You don't need to actually put your entire head underwater, though. Just splash some cold water on your face right before you hold your breath, or try using a cold, wet washcloth. Don't use an ice pack instead of water, though; the same study suggests that the shock of something too cold triggers other reflexes. Just make sure the water is at a temperature of approximately 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C) and that the rest of your body is in a relaxed position.\n6. Take a breath and hold it for as long as possible. Assume a comfortable seated position and take a deep breath, filling your lungs to about 80-85% of capacity. Hold your breath for as long as possible, staying completely still to avoid expending unnecessary energy and wasting oxygen. It is usually better to have someone else timing your progress, as time will pass more quickly and you will be able to hold your breath for longer if you are not constantly watching the clock. Holding your breath for long periods of time can be painful, and it usually necessary to find a way to distract yourself if you are to successfully achieve your goal. One popular distraction technique is to move through the alphabet from A to Z, thinking of a friend, celebrity or historical figure whose name begins with each letter. Aleix Segura Vendrell, who set a world record for holding his breath underwater for 24 minutes and 3 seconds, is a proponent of this very technique. Don't hold air in your cheeks. This method is meant for an air reserve, which requires \"letting go\" of the air in your lungs and switching it with the air in your cheeks. This is known as \"circular breathing\" and can be very difficult to achieve, usually resulting in the breath-holder losing both air reserves. Therefore, it may be best to avoid this method for the time being.\n7. Relax every muscle in your body. It is vital that you relax completely and release any tension from your body as you hold your breath. Close your eyes and focus on releasing the tension from each body part in turn, starting with your feet, and moving slowly upwards along your body, all the way up to your neck and head. By doing this, it is possible to significantly lower your heart rate and increase the time you are able to hold your breath for. Concentrate on something that's relaxing to you. When you can't concentrate anymore, distract yourself by doing something with your hands, like counting to 99 with your fingers. Try not to move during any point when holding your breath. When you move, you waste oxygen and that will cut down the time you're able to go without breathing. Stay still.\n8. Exhale slowly. When you can't hold your breath anymore, try to avoid exhaling all the air in your lungs in a mad rush. First, exhale about 20% of your air, then inhale again so that oxygen gets to your most critical areas faster. Then you can exhale and inhale completely.\n9. Repeat these steps 3-4 times per session. It is not recommended to do this any more, as it could damage your lungs and body. Try one session in the morning and one session at night if you wish. Keep practicing and before you know it, you will be able to hold your breath for several minutes.\n\n\n## Take the necessary safety precautions\n\n1. Always practice with a partner. It is highly advisable that you practice holding your breath with a partner. The main reason for this is that they can ensure your safety if you happen to pass out (which is fairly common during limit-testing training sessions), preventing you from hurting yourself and taking care of you while you recover your senses. In addition, a partner can help to time your breath-holding sessions, notifying you at each 30 second interval.\n2. Practice sitting up, rather than lying down. The best position to practice holding your breath in is sitting upright in a comfortable position, such as on a sofa or armchair. This allows you to expend as little energy as possible while holding your breath. It is not advised that you lie down while holding your breath, as you run the risk of choking on your tongue if you happen to pass out.\n3. Do not attempt to do this underwater, unless supervised by a professional. Although the purpose of learning to hold your breath for longer is usually for use underwater, you should never do underwater training alone, without supervision. As mentioned before, it is quite common for people to black out or lose consciousness after holding their breath for prolonged periods, and if this happens underwater it can lead to drowning. Even practicing with a partner can be dangerous, as an untrained eye may be unable to tell the difference between someone who is holding their breath and someone who has passed out. If you do decide to practice with a partner, make sure that you decide on a hand signal which you can give at regular intervals to indicate to your partner that you are okay.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A fitness enthusiast, athlete, or scuba diver who is seeking to improve their breath-holding capacity for sports or underwater activities.

{"conversations": ["How to buy school supplies?", "Shopping for school supplies can be stressful for both the seasoned shopper and the beginner. Working parents or guardians have to fight the crowds that gather on weekends or after the end of the workday. Even worse, the cost of school supplies steadily increases every year, costing families an average of just under $100 in 2015. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to stress out or go bankrupt. By spacing out your purchases and practicing a few money-saving hacks, you can survive the back-to-school madness.\n\n## Buy basic supply\n\n1. Get a list from your child\u2019s school. Don\u2019t rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isn\u2019t available on the school\u2019s website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites.\n2. Know the difference between requests and requirements. Before you panic over the long supply list on the school\u2019s website, realize that many of the items are merely requests. One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.\n3. Purchase writing supplies. Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper. Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art. Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but it\u2019s always a good idea to check the supply list in case your child\u2019s teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners. Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.\n4. Buy folders. Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc. ).\n5. Purchase a day planner. Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.\n6. Buy art supplies. Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.\n7. Purchase personal supplies. Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack. Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.\n8. Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag. Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time. However, textbooks haven\u2019t gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.\n\n\n## Shop for electronics\n\n1. Buy a calculator. High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:\n\t* Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30. Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.\n2. Purchase a computer. High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list. Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget.\n3. Buy external storage. Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.\n\n\n## Save money\n\n1. Sort out what you already have. Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldn\u2019t mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s). Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt. Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.\n2. Stick to basics and generics. Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Don\u2019t worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs.\n3. Take advantage of discounts. Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back. Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.\n4. Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks. Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.\n5. Buy refurbished. Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost. However, you should do your homework first. Only buy refurbished products from trusted retailers like Apple or Best Buy, which offer warranties and free repairs on known issues.\n6. Buy a little at a time throughout the year. There\u2019s no rule that you have to buy school supplies in July and August. Each time you\u2019re shopping for groceries or picking up a prescription, stop by the school supply aisle to look for unannounced discounts on common required supplies.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally-conscious small business owner or manager seeking practical strategies to minimize their carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable future.

Usually, this is used to define class/module (\"static\") methods:\n```class String\n  class << self\n    def value_of obj\n      obj.to_s\n    end\n  end\nend\nString.value_of 42   # => \"42\"\n```\nThis can also be written as a shorthand:\n```class String\n  def self.value_of obj\n    obj.to_s\n  end\nend\n```\nOr even shorter:\n```def String.value_of obj\n  obj.to_s\nend\n```\n\nWhen inside a function definition, ```self``` refers to the object the function is being called with.

At this point any structural or physical changes become permanent and the paper will not return to its original form.\n\nEvery material has a different elastic limit or yield, and plastic region. Imagine holding a piece of paper slightly bent but not folding or creasing it. The plant fibers that make up the paper will not have exceeded their elastic limit. So as soon as you let go of the paper sheet it will quickly return to its noncreased original flat state. However, if you were to roll that piece of paper into a cylinder and hold it for a few minutes, some of these fibers will be pushed beyond the elastic limit which is evident since it will not lie flat anymore since slight deformations have occurred in this sheet.\n\nNow, when you properly fold a piece of paper as you would during Origami, the plant fibers along the crease are pushed into the plastic region of the paper, causing a fracture point at the actual line of the fold. A practical example of this is if you were to fold a piece of paper, you will note that if you stretch the paper evenly on both sides of the fold, the paper will tear right on the fold (a quick way to &quot;cut&quot; paper if you have no scissors). The fold then becomes an irreversible structural failure and the fibers in the paper will never regain their original state.\n\nBecause of this damage to its structure, the paper will from then on have this fold. And no matter how hard you try to flatten out the fold it will never return to its original state. This is why Origami models continually retain their shape."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A curious and inquisitive individual with a strong interest in physics, materials science, or engineering.

{"conversations": ["How to do the charleston?", "The Charleston is a medium- to fast-tempo dance that originated in the 20s. It was renowned for being the first social dance one could do without a partner. There are several versions of Charleston, the most popular being the 20s and 30s Charleston. The Charleston is a highly adaptable move that can be incorporated into a wide variety of dances, but the basic movement is the same.\n\n## Master the basic move\n\n1. Take a rock step back with your left foot. Touching the front of your foot to the floor, but not bringing your heel down. Don\u2019t fully shift your weight to this foot. When doing the Charleston, lean forward slightly and bend your knees a little. Keep your weight on the balls of your feet. A rock step, also called a break step, refers to a rocking step in which one\u2019s weight is very briefly transferred to another foot before being returned to the first. The only time when you might begin with your right foot is if you are following a partner. When two people dance the Charleston together, the leader starts by stepping back on the left foot, while the follower starts by stepping back on the right, mirroring the leader.\n2. Step back forward with your left foot. It should now be a step ahead of your right foot. This time, shift your weight to your left foot.\n3. Take another rock step forward with your right foot. Put the heel of your foot on the ground without bringing your whole foot down. Your weight should end up on your left foot still.\n4. Step back with your right foot. It should now be a step behind your left foot. Shift your weight back onto your right foot.\n5. Swing your arms as you step. As you move, your arms should be swinging. This may happen automatically, especially if you\u2019ve seen people do the Charleston before and know what it\u2019s supposed to look like. When your left foot is in front of you, your right arm should swing forward. When your right foot is in front of you, your left arm should swing forward.\n6. Repeat this movement. It probably won\u2019t look terribly impressive on its own, but the back, forward, forward, back motion is the building block for every variation on the Charleston. Practice until it feels natural. Then you\u2019ll be ready to start mixing things up.\n\n\n## Do the 20s charleston\n\n1. Get comfortable with the basic move. All the variations of the Charleston start with being able to do the basic step. Practice until it becomes second nature.\n2. Twist your feet in and out. Keep your weigh on the balls of your feet. On every step, the heel of the foot your have your weight on should twist out and then in again.\n3. Lift your elbows as you swing your arms. This is basically an exaggerated version of the arm swing. As always, your left arm should swing forward when your right foot is ahead of your body, and your right arm should swing forward when your left foot is in front of your body. Your arms should be bent at about a 90 degree angle. The elbow of the arm that is swinging back should come to shoulder height, and the forearm of the arm that is swinging forward should be parallel to the ground.\n4. Pivot your knees in and out. One common move used with the Charleston involves opening and closing your knees at the same time as crossing and uncrossing your arms. This may be the most well-known Charleston move. Begin with your knees bent and touching each other, with your arms crossed over them, so that your right hand is on your left knee, and your left hand is on your right now. Spread your knees apart while simultaneously uncrossing your arms, so that you end up with your left hand on your left knee, and your right hand on your right knee. #\\*Repeat this move a few times.\n\n\n## Do the 30s charleston\n\n1. Get comfortable with the basic move. All the variations of the Charleston start with being able to do the basic step. Practice until it becomes second nature.\n2. Replace a normal step with a kick step. This will add a little pep to the move. Instead of simply stepping forward, bring your knee up and kick your foot out. Your knee should come up first, propelling your foot forward a moment later. If you would not be transferring your weight to that foot anyway for this step, just swing it back again without letting it touch the ground. Otherwise, plant it back on the ground after the kick.\n3. Add a hitch as you move your leg back. Instead of simply stepping back after a kick, incorporate a hitch into the movement. Bring your knee back up, so that your upper leg is parallel to the ground, before kicking your foot back again.\n4. Touch the ground with your hand. This adds slightly more difficulty and flare. As your leg swings back and the ball of your foot touches the ground, lean forward and tap the ground with the tips of the fingers of your opposite hand.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A business owner or manager seeking to modernize their company's technology infrastructure and processes.

{"conversations": ["In this Creation magazine reprint of a 1994 article titled Exploding stars point to a young universe,  Young-Earth Creationist, Jonathan Sarfati argues that the scarcity of Supernova remnants (SNRs) in the sky suggests the Milky Way galaxy is less than billions of years old.\n\nOn average, a galaxy like our own, the Milky Way, should produce one supernova every 25 years.\n[...]\nAs can be readily seen above, a young universe model fits the data of the low number of observed SNRs. If the universe was really billions of years old, there are 7000 missing SNRs in our galaxy.\n\nDoes astronomy predict a Milky Way supernova every 25 years? Are there missing SNRs that undermine these predictions?", "There are many reasons why this is wrong. The first one is the assumption of 1 supernova per 25 years. That was the value arrived at in Gustav Tammann's article published in 1970. Others got values up to 100 years (Tammann himself changed his value later). All these values are really only good guesses.\n\nWorse errors are made in the percentage of remnants that should be visible. To start with, only a small percentage of them are visible; the others are obscured by dust in the galaxy. This does not happen to the same extent to the supernovas themselves, as they are intrinsically very much brighter. \n\nSarfati also uses an old paper to come up with the number of remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way). However, that figure was considered to be wrong (and much smaller) in later studies. Older remnants are very difficult to distinguish against a background of dust in the galaxy. Many of them disappear completely after about 10,000 years or so.\n\nIt should be noted that, using Sarfati's own reasoning, we should not be able to see any remnants older than 6000 years. Instead, we know of remnants (e.g. G166.2 + 2.5) that are over 100,000 years old. How did those originate in his universe? The same goes for the distance to supernovas. The distance to SN 1987A has been trigonometrically measured at 167,000 light years (the paper says 51,200 parsecs). In other words, its light took more than 30 times longer to reach us than the creationist universe has supposedly existed. \n\nRemember also that a supernova typically becomes either a pulsar or a black hole, both of which are very hard to observe. A black hole can only be \"seen\" through its effects on other matter, and a pulsar is mainly visible if the solar system happens to be in line with its sweeping radio beam (with some pulsars the star itself has also been seen). Hence, all we can see of them long after the event is an expanding cloud of gas that gets dimmer over the millennia.\n\nThere are several other reasons which are covered in a very good article on TalkOrigins.

Here are some suggestions for you to develop a good exercise routine:\n* First, get a full medical checkup. Make sure your heart is good, and that you don't have any medical conditions that would prevent you from exercising.\n* Start slow. If you haven't exercised in a long time, your body isn't going to be able to handle a lot. Start with walking. Do some basic stretches (don't stretch too much, it's actually bad for you if you haven't warmed up). Walk for 15-20 minutes a day, and do some light stretches (no bending over touching your toes type stuff).\n* Make a plan. Saying \"I'm going to exercise\" is pretty vague. Write down what you plan to do, and when. If you're going to lift weights, write down which exercises you're going to do, and how many sets and reps. If you're going to run, write down your route, and how long it usually takes you. Having a plan will help you track your progress, and keep you motivated.\n* Don't overdo it. If you're just starting out, twice a week is good. You need rest to build muscle, so don't be afraid to take a day off between workouts. You can always increase the frequency as you go.\n* Make it a habit. This is important. After a while, your workout schedule should become a habit, like brushing your teeth.

{"conversations": ["How to make a cat tree?", "Cats are natural climbers, and will happily crawl all over tall structures. A homemade cat tree will provide your kitty with hours of entertainment, and can be built at a fraction of the cost of cat trees available at a pet store. With some tools and dedication, you can make a customized cat tree based on your cat's personality!\n\n## Build a cat tree from wood and carpet\n\n1. Design your cat tree. Before purchasing materials or starting to build, you need a design plan, which you can sketch out on a piece of paper to determine your materials shopping list. There are several things to consider when designing your cat tree. First, consider your space limitations. Determine where your cat tree will be placed, and what size will fit well into that space. It's a good idea to take measurements to ensure your finished product will fit the space. You should also consider your cat's personality. If your cat likes to climb, consider building a tall cat tree with several perches. If your cat would like a private place to hide or sleep, consider building in a covered sleeping nook. Finally, you should keep your carpentry skills in mind. If you are relatively inexperienced with building things and using tools, keep your design simple so that you aren't overwhelmed. If you're at a loss for where to begin, there are several websites that have pictures of do-it-yourself cat trees you can use for inspiration, or even patterns for cat trees other people have made.\n2. Buy your materials. Use your design plan to determine which materials you will need. Plywood works well for horizontal platforms; dimensional lumber and cardboard or PVC pipe work well for vertical supports, and carpet is ideal for covering the wood. You may also need the following tools to assemble your tree:\n\t* A drill and some wood screws\n\t* An electric stapler\n\t* A table saw and a handsaw\n\t* A Hammer and nails\n\t* A carpet or utility knife\n\t* Wood glue or another powerful adhesive\n\t* If you want to create covered areas for your cat to perch, you may also want to pick up a concrete form tube. These heavy-duty cardboard tubes make great perches and tunnels for cats. These can also be cut lengthwise using a utility knife to create concave platforms or open-topped beds for your cat.\n3. Cut all materials to size. Using your plan as a guide, cut all the plywood and lumber sections to size. A simple hand saw works well for cutting dimensional lumber, while a handheld circular saw or table saw is better for cutting sheets of plywood. Sand rough edges if desired.\n4. Build the base of your cat tree. The tree needs a sturdy base, which should extend farther out from the center than any other platform or component of the tree in order to prevent tipping. To make the base, a good option is to cut 2 squares of plywood to size and glue them together for extra thickness. A 24\" (60 cm) square works well for a basic cat tree, but the taller your tree, the larger you'll want to make the base, to ensure it is sturdy.\n5. Cover the base in carpet. Before attaching any vertical supports, it's best to cover the base with carpet or a thick upholstery fabric. Cut the carpet to size, making it a few inches larger than the base on all sides. Then, wrap its edges over the edges of the plywood base, and staple it in place on the underside of the base with a staple gun. You may need to cut small notches in the carpet at the corners to make it fold neatly beneath the base.\n6. Attach the vertical supports to the base. The vertical supports that will hold up your platforms can be attached to the base with screws, nails, bolts or wood glue. Flip the base over so the carpeted side is face down. Then, drill holes through the underside of the base in the spots where you want the supports to be. Attach the supports by inserting screws or nails through the holes and driving them into the supports. You may want to cover the supports with carpet before attaching them, as this will be easier than doing it after they are already secured in place. To make your cat tree double as a scratching post, wrap one or more of the supports in sisal rope, securing each end with wire brads or staples, placed where they will be out view and won't be scratched by the cat. If you use staples, you may need to tap them down with a hammer to make sure they don't stick out too much.\n7. Attach the horizontal perches to the supports. The plywood perches can be attached using wood screws and/or gluing them to the tops of the vertical members. Wrap them in carpet or fabric after affixing them, so that the screws aren't visible through the carpet, and staple the carpet in place on the underside as you did with the base.\n8. Continue building according to your design. Continue to affix each component, referring back to your plan for measurements and placement. Adjustments to your design can be made as you go to account for stability issues, new ideas, or incorrect measurements.\n\n\n## Build a cat tree from a ladder\n\n1. Obtain a ladder. For this simple, unique cat tree, you'll need an old wooden ladder. Look around at garage sales, thrift furniture stores, and antique stores for one 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2 m) high. Choose an old-fashioned ladder that looks like an upside-down \"v\" with several steps on either side that are at matching levels. It's fine if the wood looks old, but make sure the foundation of the ladder isn't too rickety. You want to be certain your cat tree won't tip over and hurt your cat. Try to find a ladder that's around four feet tall. A very tall ladder my be less stable or too tall for your cat.\n2. Gather your supplies. The ladder is going to be the base of the tree, but you'll need to alter it a bit to make it more cat friendly. Gather these supplies:\n\t* A piece of plywood long and wide enough to rest on two rungs of the ladder at the same level. This will provide a platform for your cat. If you want more than one platform, you'll need more than one piece of plywood. A hammer and 2\" nails\n\t* Carpet\n\t* An electric staple gun\n\t* A piece of canvas, denim, or other sturdy fabric you can use to create a hammock between the two bottom rungs\n\t* A can of paint (optional)\n\t* A toy that hangs from a piece of rope or string\n\t* Sisal rope to wrap around the legs of the ladder\n3. Sand and paint your ladder and wood pieces. Use fine-grain sandpaper to sand down the ladder and remove any jagged edges or splinters. Do the same to the pieces of plywood you bought. Paint the ladder and plywood pieces with a coat or two of paint, if you're using it. Let the paint dry completely. Use your imagination when it comes time to paint. You could just paint the ladder to match your existing decor. But you could also paint it brown and green to make it look like a tree, or use stencils to make designs up and down the sides. Instead of painting the platforms, you can make them more comfortable for you cat by covering them in carpet, attaching it to to the platforms after nailing them into place. Use your staple gun and affix the carpet with staples in the perimeter and in the center. Make sure they don't stick up from the platform, tapping them down with a hammer if necessary.\n4. Nail the plywood platforms to the ladder. Position the first piece of plywood so that it is lined up across two ladder rungs of equal height. Use the hammer and four nails to nail the plywood into the wooden rungs, placing one nail in each corner of the plywood. Make sure the platforms are very secure when you're finished nailing them down. You may wish to use more nails, or substitute wood screws for a firmer hold. If you have a second piece of plywood to create another level, use the same procedure to nail it down.\n5. Install the hammock. Many cats enjoy sleeping in hammocks. If you'd like to add one to your cat tree, measure and cut your piece of cloth so that its four corners stretch between the four legs of the ladder. Nail or staple a corner of the fabric to the inside of each leg, making sure that the nails are all at the exact same height. Be sure the fabric you use for the hammock is thick enough to hold the weight of your cat. You can double the fabric or hem the edges before nailing it down to make it sturdier. Fabric that stretches a little is ideal for cat hammocks. Make sure nails or staples do not protrude in such a way that your cat could be scratched or cut. Tap your staples with hammer if necessary. Instead of a hammock, you can also use a carpeted concrete form tube, fastened to the ladder by attaching it to two 2X4 pieces of lumber secured to the base of the ladder with bolts, nails, or screws, between the legs. This will make your cat tree less portable, but also sturdier.\n6. Wrap the ladder legs in rope. If you want the cat tree to double as a scratching post, you can wrap the bottom of the ladder legs in strong, coarse rope. Cut the rope in four pieces. Use staples to secure the end of the first piece of rope to the inside of the base of one of the legs. Wrap the leg tightly with rope, tapping it down with a hammer if necessary. Secure the other end with a staple, making sure it is away from any areas the cat is most likely to scratch often. Repeat with the other four legs. If you want to, you can cover the legs entirely with rope, from top to bottom, using a new piece of rope between each rung of the ladder. This will allow your cat access to a scratchable surface nearly anywhere on its new cat tree.\n7. Finish up. Hang the toy you bought from the top of the ladder, somewhere the cat will be able to reach it, so as to entice your cat to come and play. Add any other finishing touches you want to make your cat tree unique and fun for your cat.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A creative and environmentally-conscious individual who enjoys crafting and upcycling household items.

{"conversations": ["How to wax your armpits?", "Waxing your armpits may be more painful than shaving, but it keeps your armpits hairless for 4-6 weeks. You can reduce the pain and prevent ingrown hairs from occurring by preparing your armpits and using the right kind of wax.\n\n## Get ready to wax\n\n1. Prepare your underarms. You can wax your armpits without making a lot of preparations, but if you take these measures the experience will be less painful and more effective:\n\t* Clean your underarms thoroughly. Wash them with soap or a good body wash, and scrub them a little to exfoliate the skin. If you use hot water, the hairs and surrounding skin will soften, making the hairs easier to remove. Trim the hair. If the hair under your arms is longer than \u20444 inch (0.6 cm), you should trim it with a pair of barber or nail scissors until it's \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) long. This makes the waxing process less painful.\n2. Wrap yourself up in an old towel. The wax is bound to spill and create a mess when you try to do it yourself, so it's best to be either naked or wrapped in something you don't mind getting impregnated with wax.\n3. Powder your underarms. Any talcum powder would do. Take a big sponge and spread the talc over the area, making sure to remove the excess powder.\n4. Heat up body wax. Make sure you use wax that is intended to be used to remove leg and body hair, rather than wax intended for use on the face. Follow the instructions on the package and heat the wax in the microwave or in a wax heater. It's ready to use when it's completely melted and runny. If this is your first time waxing, do a test on the back of your hand, where your skin is less sensitive, to make sure the wax isn't too hot. Body wax kits are available at drugstores and beauty supply stores. You can make your own sugar-based body wax using the following recipe: mix 2 cups of sugar with 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup lemon juice. Heat the mixture over low heat on the stove until the sugar dissolves and becomes a sticky syrup. The mixture is now ready to use.\n\n\n## Apply the wax\n\n1. Use a waxing stick to apply wax to your armpit. Load it with a good amount of hot wax, then swipe it on your armpit in the direction of your hair growth. Continue swiping, always in the same direction, until all of the hair is covered with wax. Some people have hair that grows in more than one direction. If this is the case with you, you'll have to wax your armpit one section at a time. Do not swipe the wax in the opposite direction. Your hair strands will get tangled up and won't pull out cleanly.\n2. Apply a wax strip. Take one of the paper wax strips that came with your kit. Place it over the area with the wax and swipe it once with your hand, in the direction of your hair growth, to position it in place. If you made your own sugar wax, use a clean piece of cotton cloth as a wax strip. Leave the edge of the strip free of the wax, so you can grasp it to pull it off. If you can't cover all of the wax with one strip, work one at a time.\n3. Remove the strip. Grasp the strip by the free edge and pull quickly against the direction of your hair growth. The strip, wax, and hair should come right off. Repeat the process with the other armpit. If the wax and hair don't come off, you'll have to try again. Use a fresh wax strip. If the process is too painful, remove the wax with olive oil and warm water, and plan to shave instead of waxing.\n\n\n## Finish the job\n\n1. Examine your armpits in the mirror. If you see bits of remaining hair, apply more wax, smooth on a wax strip, and rip it off.\n2. Remove excess wax with oil. Use the oil that came with your waxing kit or a bit of olive or almond oil to rub the areas you waxed. The oil will loosen the wax from your skin, making it easy to peel it off without pain.\n3. Clean the area. Once all of the wax has been removed, wash your armpits with warm water and a mild soap. You can apply aloe if your armpits are still stinging. If the waxing caused you to bleed, put on a small bandage until the bleeding has subsided. Do not use deodorant, moisturizer, or other creams and lotions for several hours after waxing.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A young adult or teenage girl who is interested in personal grooming and beauty, possibly exploring new methods for hair removal.

{"conversations": ["How do weather models work?", "All numerical atmospheric models are built around calculations derived from primitive equations that describe atmospheric flow. Vilhelm Bjerknes discovered the relationships and thereby became the father of numerical weather prediction. Conceptually, the equations can be thought of as describing how a parcel of air would move in relationship to its surroundings. For instance, we learn at a young age that hot air rises. The hydrostatic vertical momentum equation explains why and quantifies under what condictions hot air would stop rising. (As the air rises it expands and cools until it reaches hydrostatic equilibrium.) The other equations consider other types of motion and heat transfer.\n\nUnfortunately, the equations are nonlinear, which means that you can't simply plug in a few numbers and get useful results. Instead, weather models are simulations which divide the atmosphere into three-dimensional grids and calculate how matter and energy will flow from one cube of space into another during discrete time increments. Actual atmospheric flow is continuous, not discrete, so by necessity the models are approximations. Different models make different approximations appropriate to their specific purpose.\n\nNumerical models have been improving over time for several reasons:\n\n* More and better input data,\n* Tighter grids, and\n* Better approximations.\n\nIncreasing computational power has allowed models to use smaller grid boxes. However, the number of computations increases exponentially with the number of boxes and the process suffers diminishing returns. On the input end of things, more and better sensors improve the accuracy of the initial conditions of the model. Synoptic scale and mesoscale models take input from General Circulation Models, which helps set reasonable intial conditions. On the output end, Model Output Statistics do a remarkable job of estimating local weather by comparing the current model state with historical data of times when the model showed similar results. Finally, ensemble models take the output of several models as input and produce a range of possibly outcomes."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A meteorologist, climate scientist, or a student with an interest in meteorology and atmospheric sciences.

{"conversations": ["Could you please clearly explain what is the difference between correlation and convolution that is done by a filter on an image? \nI mean in terms of signal processing definition I know that convolution describes the output of an LTI system, that is if an LTI system produces an output due to convolution with an input system then the output signal can be described as the result of convolution of the input signal and the impulse response of the LTI system. As for the correlation, it describes the similarities between to signals. But how does convolution and correlation effect on a image and how different are they in terms of effects?\nThanks", "Convolution is correlation with the filter rotated 180 degrees. This makes no difference, if the filter is symmetric, like a Gaussian, or a Laplacian.  But it makes a whole lot of difference, when the filter is not symmetric, like a derivative.  \nThe reason we need convolution is that it is associative, while correlation, in general, is not. To see why this is true, remember that convolution is multiplication in the frequency domain, which is obviously associative. On the other hand, correlation in the frequency domain is multiplication by the complex conjugate, which is not associative.\nThe associativity of convolution is what allows you to \"pre-convolve\" the filters, so that you only need to convolve the image with a single filter. For example, let's say you have an image $f$, which you need to convolve with $g$ and then with $h$.  $f * g * h = f * (g * h)$. That means you can convolve $g$ and $h$ first into a single filter, and then convolve $f$ with it. This is useful, if you need to convolve many images with $g$ and $h$. You can pre-compute $k = g * h$, and then reuse $k$ multple times.\nSo if you are doing template matching, i. e. looking for a single template, correlation is sufficient. But if you need to use multiple filters in succession, and you need to perform this operation on multiple images, it makes sense to convolve the multiple filters into a single filter ahead of time."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A data scientist, engineer, or student with a background in signal processing or image analysis.

{"conversations": ["How to select an open source content management system?", "## Choose an open source cms\n\n1. Research your options. A quick Internet search will tell you that WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, Plone and Blogger are probably the most common; however, there are dozens more. Make sure you are testing a CMS, rather than a vendor, as the names may be easily confused in the beginning. Many online reviews say that WordPress CMS is good for blogs, and Drupal is great for community-oriented sites, with a lot of user interaction. Joomla! works well for the most basic websites and users. Plone is a newer CMS that manages documents and community very well. You should make your own decisions based on what looks best for your site.\n2. Decide what experience you want to give your website visitors. Sit down with your marketing or branding department and make a list of the essential parts of a website, so that you can look for them in your CMS. This will help you to choose the frontend designs you prefer. You can also get a private web development company to design your template and plug in an open source CMS. This is considerably more expensive than simply choosing a ready-made design through an Internet-based service. It may allow you extensive customization of your site.\n3. Decide what you need from the backend of the CMS. For example, decide if you need search engine optimization (SEO) features, mailing lists, events applications, customization, scalability or a specific programming language.\n4. Test drive each programming platform. Assign 2 to 3 people who will be working with the programs most to do a trial run, or \"sandbox\" version, of the CMS. They should report back with reviews and rate them according to overall preference. Open source CMS can all be installed for free. You may need to hire a web programmer to install them, if no one in your organization is very computer savvy. You still want to test the backend of the system with the non-technical users. You can also go to opensourcecms.com to try over 70 open source CMS programs for free. The site will allow you to do a demo without having to install the whole program.\n5. Check if your web hosting service automatically installs any of the open source CMS. If you use shared server hosting, then the tech support you pay for may include installation of 1 of these programs. If so, and you like the program, you can save money that would otherwise go toward hiring a programmer.\n6. Read community reviews of the open source CMS or extensions you want to install. Each open source program has a web-based community that helps users ask and answer questions. You can get an idea of how easy it will be to accomplish the things on your marketing list by searching for reviews and instructions.\n7. Choose a CMS according to website functionality and employee functionality. Compare each CMS/template with the frontend/backend list you made. Choose the program that fulfills the most preferences on your lists.\n\n\n## Implement an open source cms\n\n1. Decide how you want to do installation and support. Since open source CMS are available to all, they have community forums that help with support. However, if you aren't very proficient with computer programming, you will have to follow an alternate method. Hire a web vendor to install the program and train your staff. Although you will need to pay for this service, it will decrease the problems you will have with the open source CMS. Ask if the vendor offers tech support help in the future at a fee. Task your IT department with installing and training staff. You may have to send part of your staff to a course to learn all about the program and its requirements. If you already have a fully competent IT staff, you will save money with this option. Install the program yourself and train your staff. If you and your employees are very computer literate, it may not be essential to get outside support. You can look for plugins in the directory and read how to fix problems in the forums.\n2. Be prepared for an adoption period. After changing any database, you should be prepared for a slow period where your employees learn to use the program, and at times, there are complaints. Try to wait for a period of 30 to 90 days before deciding if the CMS will work, because most website changes take time to adjust to.\n3. Look to enhance your open source CMS. Look for extensions and plugins, once your employees are completely functional with the backend. The great thing about CMS is that talented volunteer programmers are improving it all the time. Subscribe to blogs, newsletters or forums about your CMS blog. This will keep you aware of new updates or plugins. It will also direct you to websites that use the CMS so that you can see what others are doing with it.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A web developer, IT professional, or tech enthusiast with a focus on open-source software.

In this article we'll see several alternatives to one time usage of rolls of wrapping paper for gifts.\n\n## Reuse wrap paper\n\n1. Wrap the gift in such a way as to promote reuse: When selecting wrapping paper, select paper which is durable. When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.\n2. Unwrap the gift for reuse, too. When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper. Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.\n3. Share the paper with several guests. If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.\n\n\n## Use gift bag with a gift tag\n\n1. Purchase a nice gift bag (or reusable bag), rather than wrapping paper for each gift.\n2. Make and attach a large gift tag to the bottom of the bag covering the manufacturers name, etc. Include at least 12 rows on the tag. Write your name, email, occasion and date on the first row of the tag.\n3. Place gift item in bag and present to honoree as usual. After honoree removes the gift from the bag, they save the bag for the next occasion.\n4. When the honoree has an occasion to give a gift, they write their name, occasion and date on the first blank line on the tag.\n5. Repeat the re-use and gifting process 12 times.\n6. Have the twelfth person to receive the gift bag send an email to everyone listed on the tag with the bag's history. Assuming the bag remains in usable condition, they can then attach a new tag on top of the original tag and repeat the process.\n7. Keep the reuse and gifting chain going until the back is too worn to continue. Ultimately, recycle the bag.\n\n\n## Make a gift display rather than gift wrap\n\n1. Bring unwrapped gifts to the celebration.\n2. Place the gifts on a display table. Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.\n3. Prepare a one page log for the honoree. It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift. The honoree can then use this log to send Thank You notes. Only one sheet of paper is consumed for the entire event!\n4. When it is time to present the gifts, position the honoree behind the table along with the guests. Take photos of the covered table, uncover the table and photograph the table displaying the gifts. (Optionally, make a video of the table being uncovered.)\n\n\n## Gift wrap (blindfold) the honoree instead of the gift\n\n1. If your honoree is adventuresome, blindfold them with an attractive looking bandana or blindfold prior to displaying or presenting any gifts.\n2. Present each gift to the blindfolded honoree while the people giving the gift stand behind them.\n3. Have the honoree identify the gift by feeling of it.

The dashes represent numbers that do not begin with {1,3,4,9}, and so are unusable in our path.\n ```1024  3072  9216  ----   ----   ----    ----    ----     ----     ----      ----     .```\n ```----  1536  4608  13824  41472  124416  373248  1119744  3359232  10077696  30233088 .```\n ```----  ----  ----  ----   ----   ----    186624  ----     1679616  ----      15116544 .```\n ```128   384   1152  3456   10368  31104   93312   ----     ----     ----      ----     .```\n ```----  192   ----  1728   ----   15552   46656   139968   419904   1259712   3779136  .```\n ```32    96    ----  ----   ----   ----    ----    ----     ----     ----      1889568  .```\n ```16    48    144   432    1296   3888    11664   34992    104976   314928    944784   .```\n ```----  ----  ----  ----   ----   1944    ----    17496    ----     157464    472392   .```\n ```4     12    36    108    324    972     ----    ----     ----     ----      ----     .```\n ```----  ----  18    ----   162    486     1458    4374     13122    39366     118098   .```\n ```1     3     9     ----   ----   ----    ----    ----     ----     19683     ----     .```\n From here, we can see two different routes of 28 steps each: (1536->373248->93312->384->48->3888->972->36->9->1) and (1536->373248->46656->3779136->944784->3888->972->36->9->1).  \n\nProving minimality:  \n\n   Since a path of length 28 exists (we've found two), we can rule out anything that's too far away to be used in a shortest path.\n Moving from (1,9) to (0,0) must take at least ten steps on its own, so we can move at most nine steps completely out of the way (and nine steps back) in a shortest route. That limits us to only considering x-coordinates up to 10; any further would require making at least ten '*3' steps, eleven '\u00f73' steps, and at least nine '\u00f72' steps, putting the route definitely longer than 28.\n With our x-coordinate limited to [0,10], we now look at the bottlenecks.\n It should be clear that any shortest route must start by going from 1536 to 93312 in seven steps, and must end by going from 3888 to 1 in nine steps. These are both forced by unique bottlenecks; there is only one way to step from $(x,7)$ to $(x,6)$ and only one way to step from $(x,3)$ to $(x,2)$ in this range.\n This leaves at most twelve steps to go from 93312 to 3888. Either by observation or by pointing out that there are only two ways to go from $(x,6)$ to $(x,5)$, we can see that there are exactly two shortest routes from 93312 to 3888, and both require all twelve steps.\n Therefore, the shortest route is 28 steps, and there are exactly two ways to do so, both of which are described in Jo's solution and below the chart.    \n"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A mathematician, puzzle enthusiast, or software engineer with a strong background in algorithms and number theory.

{"conversations": ["How to reduce smog?", "Smog is a form of air pollution that is produced in the atmosphere when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC). When this reaction occurs, particles are released into the atmosphere, and oxygen at the ground level absorbs harmful compounds (ozone). All of this creates what we consider smog. Recent years have seen an increase in campaigns for the reduction of smog due to its harmful effects towards both humans and the environment.\n\n## Change your car habit\n\n1. Drive less. Vehicles that run only on gasoline produce nitrogen dioxide as a byproduct of driving and idling, so one easy way to cut back on emissions is to drive less. Try walking, biking, or taking public transit instead. If your location is close enough, try walking or biking, especially if the destination has showers for clean up (workplace, gym, etc.). Many large cities offer public transportation such as buses, subways, trains and \"park and ride\" which allows you to park your vehicle and take public transit to your destination. Don't drive during certain times. For example, drive less during peak traffic periods, when it is extremely hot, or when there are ozone warnings in effect. This is because gas fumes turn into harmful ground level ozone when they heat up. If driving is a necessity, try setting up a carpool so there are fewer cars on the road and fewer trips being made.\n2. Maintain your car. Keeping your car \"healthy\" will not only improve mileage and save money, it can also reduce emissions. Get regular tune-ups and oil changes and make sure your tires are properly inflated to ensure your car is functioning at its best. Many states require smog and emission tests to make sure your car isn't emitting too much pollution. These are usually required annually or bi-annually. Inflating your tires to the correct pressure allows the engine to function better by maintaining a steady load. Consult your mechanic or your owner's manual for specific information regarding maintenance for your vehicle.\n3. Fuel up in cooler temperatures. Pump gas early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures drop. This prevents the fumes from gasoline from heating up and creating harmful toxins at ground level (ozone). There are alternative fuel sources that are in the works such as ethanol, natural gas, and hydrogen, but not all engines can function off of these fuel sources.\n4. Purchase a hybrid or electric vehicle. These vehicles have been known to dramatically reduce emissions for many reasons (depending on the type of model). Some decrease the consumption of fuel while others do away with fuel altogether. The result is a reduction in tailpipe emissions and therefore a reduction in smog. Hybrid vehicles are fueled by gasoline alone but have the ability to recapture energy and use it to power the car, resulting in less fuel consumption. Electric vehicles are powered by electricity alone and must be plugged in and charged in order to drive. Plug-in hybrids are the best of both worlds, running off of either electricity or gasoline.\n\n\n## Change your consumption habit\n\n1. Avoid high VOC products. VOCs are chemicals that easily escape into the atmosphere through common use around the house. Check the front label of household products to determine if they contain VOCs. Examples of common products include nail care products (acetone, ethyl alcohol), paint strippers or adhesive removers (methylene chloride), and aerosol spray products (butane). Check the National Institute of Health's Household Products Database for more information about specific products and their ingredients. Shop for \"green\" products that don't contain VOCs. If you must use VOC products, buy in small quantities that can be used quickly instead of stored. If you must store the product, do so in a tightly sealed, original container, in a well-ventilated area.\n2. Avoid gas-powered yard equipment. Gasoline emissions are one of the major causes of smog--whether from vehicles or lawn equipment. Try eco-friendly lawn mowers, hedgers, trimmers, or any other lawn equipment that can be powered electrically. You can also avoid mowing altogether by changing the material in your yard. Opt for artificial grass, succulents, hard landscapes, or rock gardens to do away with mowing forever. This will also save you time and money spent on maintenance and watering. There are also \"real grass alternatives\" that look and act like traditional grass turf, but require less maintenance.\n3. Buy local. When you buy products that are made locally, it cuts down on the cost of transport which reduces emissions. Local farmers' markets and grocery stores can help you determine where items were produced. There are many sites online that link local buyers and sellers such as Direct Local Food, GrowBuyEat, and AgLocal. Besides farmers' markets, try local farmers' stands, farms, and wineries. There are even many restaurants that are joining the movement towards supporting locally grown items. Make a community garden. Grow vegetables and fruit for your community and local distribution.\n4. Be energy efficient in your home. The less energy you consume at home, the less pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. There are many ways to decrease energy consumption including through lighting, heating and cooling, and appliance use. Replace your old incandescent light bulbs with energy saving halogen incandescents, CFLs, and LEDs which can be found at your local hardware store. For heating and cooling try energy-saving thermostats that automatically reset temperatures while you're away from home. Shop for energy-efficient appliances that use less energy such as washers, dryers, refrigerators, and dishwashers.\n\n\n## Take a stand\n\n1. Don't support organizations that have poor environmental practices. By not supporting commerce from these companies, you raise awareness of the problem. For example, companies like Nestle, Pfizer, and Walmart have been known to not only add pollution to the air but to also violate pollution regulations. An app such as Buycott can help you identify products and companies with poor environmental track records, simply by scanning a product's barcode.\n2. Promote your stance. Don't be afraid to tell people your opinion on the issue, and what you are doing to help solve it. You can do this by speaking to those closest to you (family, friends, co-workers) or reach more people through social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube). Start a community project such as an initiative to replace light bulbs or a carpool to a farmer's market once a month. Start a carpool with your co-workers. Not only will it cut down on emissions but it will demonstrate your passion for the cause.\n3. Contact local politicians and business leaders. Ask them for information about what they are doing to reduce smog levels in your community. If they do not reply or reply with inadequate measures, consider lobbying for change. Sign a petition. There are many petitions online that are lobbying for better air quality control by our government. Find one that peaks your interest, or start your own. Try sites like change.org or petitions.whitehouse.gov to look for petitions or start one on a smaller, local level.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental activist, marine biologist, or a concerned citizen with a strong interest in sustainability and ocean conservation.

{"conversations": ["How to increase driving visibility in rain?", "Driving in the rain, especially after dark, can cause dramatic declines in visibility.  The best ways to improve driving visibility in the rain are to turn on your headlights and your windshield wipers.  Stay away from large vehicles that leave a large spray in their wake.  Keep your headlights clean and clear, and change windshield wipers that are aged or deteriorating.\n\n## Use and maintain your wipers\n\n1. Turn your windshield wipers on. Unless your car comes with automatic wipers, you\u2019ll need to manually activate your windshield wipers to improve driving visibility in the rain. Windshield wipers typically have three different settings: slow, medium, and fast. If the rain is light, select the slow speed. If the rain is heavier (and your visibility is poorer), select a faster speed. If you wish, you could use the high speed in low levels of rain, but it is not necessary. There is no objective criteria for determining whether you need a faster or slower wiper speed when driving in the rain. Using your best judgment, select the wiper speed that most closely corresponds to the rain\u2019s intensity at any given time. If you have a rear windshield wiper, activate it, too.\n2. Change old or brittle wiper inserts. The windshield wiper consists of two parts: the rubber wiper insert that swipes across the windshield and the metal blade that actually holds it. Check your wiper inserts regularly for stiffness or cracks, and replace them if you detect any. Most windshield wiper inserts will need to be changed at least once every three years to improve visibility in rain. Consult your owner\u2019s manual or an auto parts store for information regarding the type and size of wiper blades you need. Generally, wiper inserts can simply be slid into and out of the metal blade itself. If you regularly park your car outside, you\u2019ll probably have to replace your windshield wipers more often than if you park in the garage.\n3. Replace windshield wiper blades as needed. If your wiper blades are rusty, bent, or corroded, replace them, too. Use high-quality wiper blades, preferably ones coated with a rain repellent. If there are areas of your windshield that do not get properly wiped when you use your wipers, you\u2019ll know that the wiper is bent or applying uneven pressure to the windshield. Generally, wiper blades can simply be unsnapped from the metal arm that holds the blade, then a new blade can be snapped in. Consult your owner\u2019s manual or your local auto parts store for information regarding the sort of wiper blades you need.\n4. Keep your wiper blades clean. Dirty windshield wiper blades can cause streaking and water beading. To clean your wiper blades, soak a lint-free cloth or paper towel in windshield washer fluid. Wipe the cloth or paper towel along the length of the blades. Turn the cloth or paper towel over as needed to ensure you\u2019re always wiping the blades with a clean area.\n\n\n## Use and clean your headlights\n\n1. Turn on your headlights. If you\u2019re driving in the rain on an overcast day or at night, your headlights can help you increase visibility. Even if you\u2019re driving in rain during the day, turning your headlights on is a good idea since it allows other vehicles to see you. Many headlights have different settings. Choose the correct one for the existing conditions. For instance, if you\u2019re driving in light rain through a dark area, you might choose to use your brightest headlight setting. If you\u2019re driving through fog as well as rain, use your fog lights.\n2. Wash your headlights. If your headlights are caked in grime or dirt, they will not shine as brightly as they should. This could reduce your visibility when driving in the rain. To keep your headlights shining properly, wash them with soapy water either on their own or when you wash your car. There is no regular schedule according to which you must wash your headlights. If your headlights appear less luminous than they previously were, or if they\u2019re visibly dirty, give them a wash.\n3. Scrub your headlights with sandpaper. For a deeper clean, soak a piece of 1000 grit wet/dry sandpaper in cold water. Apply painter\u2019s tape to the area of around the perimeter of your headlights. After 10 minutes, lightly sand the headlights, moving in straight strokes from side-to-side. Spray the headlight with water while you work. Repeat the procedure using 1500 grit sandpaper, then 2000 grit, 2500 grit, and 3000 grit wet/dry sandpaper. Alternate the direction of your scrubbing each time. For instance, if you moved side-to-side with one piece of sandpaper, use an up-and-down scrubbing method for the next. When the discoloration, dirt, and scratches on the headlight are gone, move on to the next level of sandpaper. There is no regular schedule according to which you must engage in deep cleaning of your headlights. Give your headlights a deep cleaning with sandpaper if washing your headlights using the standard method produces inadequate results.\n\n\n## Take additional measure\n\n1. Don\u2019t follow trucks or buses closely. The spray produced by these large vehicles will decrease your visibility in rain. Try to keep several car lengths away from trucks and buses. If you need to pass trucks or buses, do so quickly so as to minimize the time you spend behind or beside them, where you can experience significant spray.\n2. Put on some polarized glasses. If you\u2019re driving through rain during the day, put on a pair of polarized sunglasses to increase your driving visibility. If you\u2019re driving in rain at night, you will not be able to increase driving visibility by wearing polarized sunglasses.\n3. Turn on the demisters if necessary. If the temperature of the rain and the temperature inside your vehicle are too different, your windows might fog over. To combat this and increase visibility when driving in the rain, turn on the demisters.\n4. Slow down. Slowing your speed can give you extra time to see what\u2019s ahead. You should be able to see the space you\u2019ll be driving through at least 12 seconds before you pass through it. When driving in the rain, adjust your speed to meet this visibility standard.\n5. Clean your windshield. Sometimes your windshield wipers are not strong enough to wipe away all the grime on your windshield. Dirt stuck to the top corners, especially, could dribble down during a rainstorm. The best way to get your windshield clean is to have it cleaned by a professional at your local auto wash. Alternately, you could soak a cloth or sponge in soapy water and wipe it across the windshield until the entire surface is clean. Clean your windshield when it is dirty. Don\u2019t forget to clean your windshield wiper blades, too.\n6. Apply a coat of rain repellent to your windshield. Rain repellents will prevent rain from beading on your windshield. Instead, rain will roll smoothly off the windshield upon contact. Specific directions for use vary depending on the product you use. Generally, though, you can simply spray the repellent of your choice on the windshield, then wipe it away using a gentle circular motion. Rain repellent solutions usually need to be applied once every six months.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A motorist or driving enthusiast who is concerned about road safety during rainy conditions.

{"conversations": ["How to make a bow for a wreath?", "A big part of making a beautiful wreath is adding on a bow! Bows can be the perfect accents to holiday, seasonal, and everyday wreaths. You can make a fluffy bow with plenty of full loops, or you can use burlap to make a floppy bow for a look that's a little more rustic. Whatever you choose to do, it'll take minimal materials and a little bit of practice to make the perfect bow for your wreath!\n\n## Make a fluffy bow with wire ribbon\n\n1. Cut off a 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) piece of floral wire. Set it to the side somewhere it can be easily found later on. This is the wire you will use at the end to hold your entire bow together. If you don't have floral wire, you could also use a pipe cleaner.\n2. Unspool your wired ribbon, take one end, and make a small circle with it. For making a fluffy bow, use a minimum of 9 feet (2.7 m)\u2014the more ribbon, the fluffier the bow! Make a small circle, about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide, at one end of the ribbon. If you're at the store and aren't sure if the ribbon is wired or not, simply pinch a portion of it together\u2014if it keeps its shape, it's wired. Keep in mind as you work that you'll need to stop when you have about 12 inches (30 cm) of fabric remaining.\n3. Pinch the end of the circle together in your non-dominant hand. Where the end of the ribbon touches the rest of the ribbon, pinch that seam together and hold it between the fingers of your non-dominant hand. This leaves your dominant hand free to shape the rest of the bow. You're going to use your non-dominant hand to hold together the fabric the entire time you're making the bow.\n4. Create a figure-eight by making loops on either side of the circle. Make a loop on one side of the circle, pinch the fabric in the middle, and then make a loop on the other side of the circle to create the figure-eight image. Continue pinching together the fabric in the middle that meets at your fingers. When you look at the bow from the side, it'll look like the number \u201c8.\u201d\n5. Continue making progressively larger figure-eight loops. Make at least 5 or 6 layers of ribboned loops. If you are using a lot of fabric, you may even make closer to 9 or 10! Remember to keep gathering the material in the middle by pinching it between your fingers. At this stage, your loops will be layered rather than spread out and the bow might look a little strange, but don't worry! You're on the right path.\n6. Stop making loops when you have about 12 inches (30 cm) of fabric left. Take the end of the ribbon and place it between your fingers in your non-dominant hand, forming a large circle. 12 inches (30 cm) of ribbon will produce bow tails that are about 6 inches (15 cm) long each.\n7. Thread the piece of floral wire around the fabric you've been pinching. Cinch it tight and twist it several times to make sure it's secure. You can now release that bundle of fabric you've been holding on to! If you're using a pipe cleaner, follow the same process: thread it around the pinched fabric and twist it off to ensure it'll stay in place.\n8. Cut the middle of the last big loop you made to form the tails of the bow. Cut in the middle of the fabric and watch as the ends fall down, creating the tails of your bow. You could even cut small triangles out of each end to add an additional flourish to the design. If you want longer tails, leave more fabric at the end when you stop making your loops. If you want shorter tails, you can simply trim them to the length you want.\n9. Shape the ribbon by rearranging the loops. Spread out the loops until you create a large, fluffy, full-looking bow. Make sure to pull loops upwards and down, and do your best to leave no see-through spaces between the loops. The great thing about using wire ribbon is that you can reform the loops easily if they get bent out of shape.\n\n\n## Create a bow from unwire ribbon\n\n1. Cut off a 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) piece of floral wire. Leave this piece of wire off to the side somewhere you can find it easily later on. You'll use it to secure your bow once you're finished making it. If you don't have floral wire, use a pipe cleaner.\n2. Take your ribbon and make a twist at the end of it. Use at least 2 feet (0.61 m) of ribbon for this bow. Twist the end, leaving about 6 inches (15 cm) of fabric for one of your tail ends. If you're using ribbon that isn't patterned on both sides, just make sure that the patterned or colored side is on the outside of the twist.\n3. Make multiple loops, twisting the fabric at the end of each loop. Hold the forming bow in your non-dominant hand and use your dominant hand to make the loops and twists. How large you make the loops depends on how big you want the bow to be\u2014use smaller loops for a more concentrated bow, and use bigger loops for a larger, fluffier bow. For this bow, you won't be making a figure-eight pattern. Instead, you'll just be making each loop consecutively right next to one another.\n4. Stop making loops on an even number. Make anywhere from 6-10 loops (or more, if you're going for a really large bow!) before you stop. The even number helps create symmetry in your bow.\n5. Cut off your bow from the rest of the ribbon. Cut the ribbon so that there are roughly equal-sized tails on each side. If you're worried about matching the sides, just leave extra room so you can trim the ribbon tails to match later on. It's okay if the edge is a little jagged\u2014you can tidy it up later on.\n6. Thread your floral wire through the center of the bow. Position the wire so that half of the loops are on one side and the rest are on the other. Twist off the floral wire several times so that it stays firmly in place. If you're using a pipe cleaner, follow the same process. You can leave the excess floral wire in place and use it to attach the bow to the wreath later on.\n7. Spread out the loops to create a fluffy bow! Position the loops in all directions so that it looks full. Because this bow is made of unwired fabric, it might look a little loose, but that's part of the beauty of it! If you want, you can also cut small triangles out of the ends of the tails for an added flourish.\n\n\n## Craft a rustic bow with burlap\n\n1. Cut off 3 separate sections of burlap ribbon. Make one piece 60 inches (150 cm), one 24 inches (61 cm), and the last one 8 inches (20 cm). Additionally, cut the 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap in half lengthwise. These measurements will create a large, rustic bow that will hang down off of your wreath.\n2. Hold the large ribbon in the center, and fold the sides down and across. Leave about 16 inches (41 cm) of fabric in the center before making your folds, as this will be the main part of your bow. Fold each side down and across so that the end of each one is on the opposite side. It's usually easier if you do this at a workstation so you can lay the ribbon down flat.\n3. Fold the 24 in (61 cm) piece of ribbon so the ends meet in the middle. Place the folded ribbon, seam-side down, over top of and in the middle of the 16 in (41 cm) section from the largest ribbon, layering one on top of the other. This second piece of fabric helps create depth in your bow by giving it a second dimension, rather than just having a flat, single-layer bow.\n4. Gather the fabric in the middle of your ribbons to make a bow shape. Pinch the fabric together in the very middle to create the 2 sides of your bow, and hold the fabric together using your non-dominant hand. One side of the bow should be a mirror reflection of the other side.\n5. Wrap your floral wire around the center of the bow. Thread it around the middle, and twist it off several times to ensure it's secure and won't come undone. If you don't have floral wire, you could also use a pipe cleaner. You can either trim off the excess ends of the wire, or let them stick out to the sides so you can use them to attach the bow to the wreath later on.\n6. Cover the floral wire with the halved 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap. Wrap it around several times until there isn't any excess ribbon to be wrapped around. If you want, you could also take the other half of that 8 in (20 cm) piece of burlap and wrap it around the middle, too. A fun variation here is to use a colored or patterned ribbon to cover the floral wire for a little pop of color!\n7. Use your glue gun to secure the burlap on the backside. Flip your bow over and apply some hot glue to the burlap that's covering the floral wire. Use your scissors to trim off any burlap that is still sticking up. Let the hot glue dry before you flip it back over so it doesn't accidentally get stuck to your table. If you don't have a hot glue gun, you could use double-sided tape.\n8. Cut out triangles from the ends of the \u201ctails\u201d for an added flourish. Instead of leaving the ends of your burlap as straight edges, cut out a triangle shape from each end for a rustic and authentic feel. It's okay if the triangles don't match exactly, but try to keep them about the same general size.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A DIY enthusiast or a crafter who enjoys creating handmade decorations for various occasions, such as weddings, holidays, or home decor.

{"conversations": ["How to make a cat tree?", "Cats are natural climbers, and will happily crawl all over tall structures. A homemade cat tree will provide your kitty with hours of entertainment, and can be built at a fraction of the cost of cat trees available at a pet store. With some tools and dedication, you can make a customized cat tree based on your cat's personality!\n\n## Build a cat tree from wood and carpet\n\n1. Design your cat tree. Before purchasing materials or starting to build, you need a design plan, which you can sketch out on a piece of paper to determine your materials shopping list. There are several things to consider when designing your cat tree. First, consider your space limitations. Determine where your cat tree will be placed, and what size will fit well into that space. It's a good idea to take measurements to ensure your finished product will fit the space. You should also consider your cat's personality. If your cat likes to climb, consider building a tall cat tree with several perches. If your cat would like a private place to hide or sleep, consider building in a covered sleeping nook. Finally, you should keep your carpentry skills in mind. If you are relatively inexperienced with building things and using tools, keep your design simple so that you aren't overwhelmed. If you're at a loss for where to begin, there are several websites that have pictures of do-it-yourself cat trees you can use for inspiration, or even patterns for cat trees other people have made.\n2. Buy your materials. Use your design plan to determine which materials you will need. Plywood works well for horizontal platforms; dimensional lumber and cardboard or PVC pipe work well for vertical supports, and carpet is ideal for covering the wood. You may also need the following tools to assemble your tree:\n\t* A drill and some wood screws\n\t* An electric stapler\n\t* A table saw and a handsaw\n\t* A Hammer and nails\n\t* A carpet or utility knife\n\t* Wood glue or another powerful adhesive\n\t* If you want to create covered areas for your cat to perch, you may also want to pick up a concrete form tube. These heavy-duty cardboard tubes make great perches and tunnels for cats. These can also be cut lengthwise using a utility knife to create concave platforms or open-topped beds for your cat.\n3. Cut all materials to size. Using your plan as a guide, cut all the plywood and lumber sections to size. A simple hand saw works well for cutting dimensional lumber, while a handheld circular saw or table saw is better for cutting sheets of plywood. Sand rough edges if desired.\n4. Build the base of your cat tree. The tree needs a sturdy base, which should extend farther out from the center than any other platform or component of the tree in order to prevent tipping. To make the base, a good option is to cut 2 squares of plywood to size and glue them together for extra thickness. A 24\" (60 cm) square works well for a basic cat tree, but the taller your tree, the larger you'll want to make the base, to ensure it is sturdy.\n5. Cover the base in carpet. Before attaching any vertical supports, it's best to cover the base with carpet or a thick upholstery fabric. Cut the carpet to size, making it a few inches larger than the base on all sides. Then, wrap its edges over the edges of the plywood base, and staple it in place on the underside of the base with a staple gun. You may need to cut small notches in the carpet at the corners to make it fold neatly beneath the base.\n6. Attach the vertical supports to the base. The vertical supports that will hold up your platforms can be attached to the base with screws, nails, bolts or wood glue. Flip the base over so the carpeted side is face down. Then, drill holes through the underside of the base in the spots where you want the supports to be. Attach the supports by inserting screws or nails through the holes and driving them into the supports. You may want to cover the supports with carpet before attaching them, as this will be easier than doing it after they are already secured in place. To make your cat tree double as a scratching post, wrap one or more of the supports in sisal rope, securing each end with wire brads or staples, placed where they will be out view and won't be scratched by the cat. If you use staples, you may need to tap them down with a hammer to make sure they don't stick out too much.\n7. Attach the horizontal perches to the supports. The plywood perches can be attached using wood screws and/or gluing them to the tops of the vertical members. Wrap them in carpet or fabric after affixing them, so that the screws aren't visible through the carpet, and staple the carpet in place on the underside as you did with the base.\n8. Continue building according to your design. Continue to affix each component, referring back to your plan for measurements and placement. Adjustments to your design can be made as you go to account for stability issues, new ideas, or incorrect measurements.\n\n\n## Build a cat tree from a ladder\n\n1. Obtain a ladder. For this simple, unique cat tree, you'll need an old wooden ladder. Look around at garage sales, thrift furniture stores, and antique stores for one 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2 m) high. Choose an old-fashioned ladder that looks like an upside-down \"v\" with several steps on either side that are at matching levels. It's fine if the wood looks old, but make sure the foundation of the ladder isn't too rickety. You want to be certain your cat tree won't tip over and hurt your cat. Try to find a ladder that's around four feet tall. A very tall ladder my be less stable or too tall for your cat.\n2. Gather your supplies. The ladder is going to be the base of the tree, but you'll need to alter it a bit to make it more cat friendly. Gather these supplies:\n\t* A piece of plywood long and wide enough to rest on two rungs of the ladder at the same level. This will provide a platform for your cat. If you want more than one platform, you'll need more than one piece of plywood. A hammer and 2\" nails\n\t* Carpet\n\t* An electric staple gun\n\t* A piece of canvas, denim, or other sturdy fabric you can use to create a hammock between the two bottom rungs\n\t* A can of paint (optional)\n\t* A toy that hangs from a piece of rope or string\n\t* Sisal rope to wrap around the legs of the ladder\n3. Sand and paint your ladder and wood pieces. Use fine-grain sandpaper to sand down the ladder and remove any jagged edges or splinters. Do the same to the pieces of plywood you bought. Paint the ladder and plywood pieces with a coat or two of paint, if you're using it. Let the paint dry completely. Use your imagination when it comes time to paint. You could just paint the ladder to match your existing decor. But you could also paint it brown and green to make it look like a tree, or use stencils to make designs up and down the sides. Instead of painting the platforms, you can make them more comfortable for you cat by covering them in carpet, attaching it to to the platforms after nailing them into place. Use your staple gun and affix the carpet with staples in the perimeter and in the center. Make sure they don't stick up from the platform, tapping them down with a hammer if necessary.\n4. Nail the plywood platforms to the ladder. Position the first piece of plywood so that it is lined up across two ladder rungs of equal height. Use the hammer and four nails to nail the plywood into the wooden rungs, placing one nail in each corner of the plywood. Make sure the platforms are very secure when you're finished nailing them down. You may wish to use more nails, or substitute wood screws for a firmer hold. If you have a second piece of plywood to create another level, use the same procedure to nail it down.\n5. Install the hammock. Many cats enjoy sleeping in hammocks. If you'd like to add one to your cat tree, measure and cut your piece of cloth so that its four corners stretch between the four legs of the ladder. Nail or staple a corner of the fabric to the inside of each leg, making sure that the nails are all at the exact same height. Be sure the fabric you use for the hammock is thick enough to hold the weight of your cat. You can double the fabric or hem the edges before nailing it down to make it sturdier. Fabric that stretches a little is ideal for cat hammocks. Make sure nails or staples do not protrude in such a way that your cat could be scratched or cut. Tap your staples with hammer if necessary. Instead of a hammock, you can also use a carpeted concrete form tube, fastened to the ladder by attaching it to two 2X4 pieces of lumber secured to the base of the ladder with bolts, nails, or screws, between the legs. This will make your cat tree less portable, but also sturdier.\n6. Wrap the ladder legs in rope. If you want the cat tree to double as a scratching post, you can wrap the bottom of the ladder legs in strong, coarse rope. Cut the rope in four pieces. Use staples to secure the end of the first piece of rope to the inside of the base of one of the legs. Wrap the leg tightly with rope, tapping it down with a hammer if necessary. Secure the other end with a staple, making sure it is away from any areas the cat is most likely to scratch often. Repeat with the other four legs. If you want to, you can cover the legs entirely with rope, from top to bottom, using a new piece of rope between each rung of the ladder. This will allow your cat access to a scratchable surface nearly anywhere on its new cat tree.\n7. Finish up. Hang the toy you bought from the top of the ladder, somewhere the cat will be able to reach it, so as to entice your cat to come and play. Add any other finishing touches you want to make your cat tree unique and fun for your cat.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A creative and environmentally-conscious individual who enjoys crafting and upcycling household items.

{"conversations": ["How to kill a fly?", "Flies can be annoying pests, especially inside your home. If you can\u2019t remove the flies humanely, you may want to kill them. Use a flyswatter for an easy way to kill a few lone flies. Try using sprays to get rid of numerous flies. You can also kill flies with bait and traps, like fly tape, DIY traps, or Venus fly traps. Eliminating flies can be done quickly, easily, and cheaply, whether you have a single fly or dozens to remove.\n\n## Use a flyswatter\n\n1. Wait for the fly to land. Keep your eye on the fly until it lands, then get ready to make your move. Approach the fly silently and slowly so it doesn't fly away. If you don\u2019t have a flyswatter, you can use other objects with a flat surface, like a newspaper, shoe, or book.\n2. Swat the fly with a quick, downward motion. Raise your flyswatter above your head, and bring it down over the fly in a single, strong move. You are crushing the fly between your flyswatter and a hard surface. If you miss the fly the first time, wait for it to land and swat again.\n3. Wipe up the fly and clean off your flyswatter. Rinse the flyswatter in soap and water, and use a tissue or paper towel to wipe up the mess. Make sure to wash your hands! You can also disinfect with a cleaning solution to prevent spreading any germs.\n4. Try using an electric flyswatter for an easier, efficient option. Electric flyswatters are devices that lure in flies with a light and kill them upon contact. Stand near the fly with your electric flyswatter to kill it effortlessly and quickly. Be sure to read over instructions carefully before use. Avoid touching the racket area, and always let the flyswatter fully cool down before storing it.\n\n\n## Spray the fly\n\n1. Choose from either chemical sprays, household cleaners, or hairspray. Chemical sprays kill flies instantly upon contact, though they contain harsh chemicals. You can also spray the flies with household cleaners, like Windex or Formula 409, or with an aerosol like hairspray. All of these sprays will help you kill a fly. Purchase chemical fly sprays at home supply stores. Look for brands like Hot Shot and Raid. Use spray if you want to remove many flies very quickly. Chemical sprays will kill them the fastest, though they have harmful chemicals. Household cleaners are a cheaper alternative, and you likely have them at home already.\n2. Spray the air near the fly thoroughly. Spray the fly while it is in the air or when the fly lands. Hold in the trigger to release the spray, and spray directly into the air around the fly. You want to saturate the fly in the spray. If you are using chemical sprays, the fly will die instantly. If you are using household cleaners or hairspray, the spray will coat the fly's wings, making it impossible to fly. The fly will still die, just not as quickly as with chemicals.\n3. Leave the room after you spray any hazardous chemical. The chemicals contained in most fly sprays are toxic and lethal. Household cleaners also use chemicals, though not quite as toxic. Avoid inhaling these chemicals by leaving the room immediately after you spray. Leave the room for both chemical sprays and household cleaners. If you have pets or children, they should also avoid the room until the chemicals have settled. You can wait about an hour before reentering the room, so the chemicals can dissipate. This will depend on how ventilated your room is and how much chemical you spray. It is safe to come back into the room when you no longer smell the chemicals.\n4. Dispose of the dead fly and wash your hands. Scoop up the dead flies with a paper towel or tissue, and throw them in the trash can. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water! If you killed multiple flies, throw them all away before you wash your hands.\n\n\n## Remove fly with trap\n\n1. Hang fly paper in areas with many flies for a cheap and easy option. Fly papers, or fly ribbons, are strips of paper coated in a sticky attractant. Flies approach the paper because they are attracted to the smell, and they get stuck to the paper and die. You can hang fly paper near your entrances, above your windows, or next to your trash can, for example. Fly paper can be hung up indoors or outdoors. Replace your fly paper after you collect a handful of dead flies.\n2. Make your own trap for a cost effective solution. You can make your own trap with sugar water, a jar, and a paper cone. Cut a small hole around the point of the paper cone. Pour 1 part sugar and 2 parts water into the jar, and place the cone upside down inside the jar. The flies will be attracted to the sweet smell, and once they are inside, they will get stuck and drown in the liquid. You can add a piece of cut fruit to the jar to tempt the flies further. Try a piece of apple. You can also add a mix of sugar and water to a plastic bottle instead of a jar.\n3. Set out a Venus flytrap for a natural, hands-off option. Venus flytraps are carnivorous plants that feed on insects. The flytrap has a reddish, sweet-smelling interior, which insects mistake as a flower. A fly will land inside, and the flytrap will snap shut. The fly cannot escape, and the flytrap will consume the fly. Place your flytrap in areas popular fly areas, like your kitchen or near your door. Purchase Venus flytraps at most home supply stores or garden centers.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally conscious individual, possibly a sustainability advocate or a concerned citizen.

{"conversations": ["What are the major concerns about planting trees to create carbon offsets?", "Here are some common concerns about using tree planting projects to create carbon offsets:\n\n* The scheme actually has a net positive effect, both in the short and long-term/\nHow effective a tree planting scheme is in capturing and storing carbon dioxide, is for a large part determined by what happens to the trees after they are planted. When trees mature and are harvested for wood that's used in construction, then the captured carbon dioxide is stored for a long time (until the wood decomposes or is burned). However, if no trees are replanted after harvesting this will have had a one-time effect only. Also when wood is burned (for energy or in a wild fire), or if trees die quickly and decompose, then their captured carbon is released again. Of course all trees die eventually even when they are not harvested, this is part of the natural cycle, but a mature forest can store a lot more carbon than a young, newly-planted forest so it's important to keep a forest intact as much as possible.\n\n* The wrong type(s) of trees are planted in the wrong location.\nIn the past there were bad offsetting schemes that planted non-native trees, or planted trees in a location where they would change water flows  and thus change local ecosystems in a negative way. Some offsetting schemes planted  thousands of trees of the same species, resulting in a large monoculture. Such a monoculture hinders biodiversity, is susceptible to diseases and can even damage local communities.\nThere have also been reports that planting trees above a certain latitude can have a net warming effect by changing the albedo and trapping heat. \n\n* Buying offsets reduces the incentive for people to reduce their emissions.\nReducing emissions is much more effective than offsetting. Buying carbon offsets can lead to people thinking they are doing the right thing, whereas they had better spent their time and effort in reducing their emissions. Of course this point goes for all offsetting-schemes and is not specifically for planting trees.\n\n* There are more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions than planting trees.\nNowadays many offsetting schemes invest in development of renewable energy sources (in developing countries) instead of planting trees, simply because it is a more effective and cheaper way to reduce emissions."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "an environmentalist, researcher, or policy maker with a focus on climate change mitigation and sustainable practices.

Parkes says:\n\n  Breath\u2010holding is a voluntary act, but normal subjects appear unable\n  to breath\u2010hold to unconsciousness. A powerful involuntary mechanism\n  normally overrides voluntary breath\u2010holding and causes the breath that\n  defines the breakpoint.\n\nParkes explains that voluntary breath\u2010holding does not stop the central respiratory rhythm. Instead, breath holding merely suppresses its expression by voluntarily holding the chest at a certain volume. At the time of writing, no simple explanation for the break point existed. It is known to be caused by partial pressures of blood gases activating the carotid arterial chemoreceptors. They are peripheral sensory neurons that detect changes in chemical concentrations, including low oxygen (hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide (hypercapnia). Both hypoxia and hypercapnia are signs of breath holding and both are detected by the chemoreceptors. These receptors send nerve signals to the vasomotor center of the medulla which eventually overrides the conscious breath holding.\n\nThe breaking point can be postponed by large lung inflations, hyperoxia and hypocapnia, and it is shortened by increased metabolic rates.\n\nReference\n- Parkes, Exp Physiol (2006); 91(1): 1-15"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A curious and inquisitive individual with an interest in biology, physiology, or medicine.

{"conversations": ["How to write a confirmation letter?", "There are several different types of confirmation letters, each requiring a slightly different format. Basic confirmation letters written to confirm the details of a meeting, event, or other arrangements are typically brief and to the point. Employment confirmation letters usually include specific terms and conditions, so they may be longer. If you are called upon to write a letter for someone receiving the Catholic sacrament of Confirmation, your letter will be significantly more personal.\n\n## Confirm an employment offer\n\n1. Use business letter format on company letterhead. A formal business letter on company letterhead sets the appropriate tone and establishes the letter as official business communication. Set a standard font and margins, typing the body of the letter in block-paragraph style \u2013 single-spaced, with a double-space between paragraphs. Avoid using any abbreviations when you type addresses in formal business letters. For example, instead of typing \"123 Main St.,\" you would type \"123 Main Street.\" If your letterhead includes the address for your business, you can typically eliminate the address block for yourself.Tip: Government and small business agencies may have templates you can download for free that cover all the legal requirements for a formal offer of employment letter.\n2. List the job title, salary, and start date. Begin your letter with an enthusiastic tone, welcoming the recipient to the company in their new capacity. You might also include a brief summary of the recipient's job duties unless the job title makes them obvious. For example, you might write: \"On behalf of Bob Builders, Inc., I am pleased to offer you the position of Secretary at a salary of $28,500 a year. Your first day will be January 22, 2019.\"\n3. Summarize the terms and conditions of the offer. If there are any limitations to your offer they should be clearly stated. Additionally, if the offer is contingent on anything, those contingencies should be stated up front. For example, the offer may be contingent on a clean background check, or a clean drug test. This section may also include any documents the new employee needs to sign, such as a confidentiality agreement or a non-compete agreement. If you include any contingencies, provide the new employee with a deadline by which those things need to be completed. If you're only asking for documents to be signed, you might state that those documents can be signed on the new employee's first day.\n4. Provide details about any benefits your company offers. If your company offers health insurance, retirement benefits, educational assistance, paid time off, or other benefits, list those briefly. Let the new employee know when they will be eligible for those benefits, and how they can find out more information about them. Some employers start benefits at day one, but most require employees to work 60 or 90 days before they become eligible for benefits.Tip: While an employment confirmation letter may end up being more than one page, try to make it no longer than two pages. Remove details that the recipient can find on other documents they receive.\n5. Close by thanking the recipient. Let the recipient know that you're grateful for their interest in your company and that you're glad they're coming to work with you. Communicate your excitement or enthusiasm for having the new employee join your team. For example, you might say \"Thank you so much for your interest in our mission here at Bob Builders, Inc. We're excited to bring you on board and look forward to your contributions.\" Use a formal closing immediately before your signature, such as \"Sincerely\" or \"Sincerely yours.\"\n6. Include your job title under your name. The business letter template provides 4 blank lines for your signature after the formal closing. Under that space, type your first and last name. Under your name, type your job title and the name of the company. For example, you might type \"Director of Operations, Bob Builders, Inc.\"\n7. Proofread your letter carefully. Make sure your letter is free of any typos and spelling or grammatical errors. You may also want someone from human resources to read over the letter and verify that all the content is correct. Double-check numbers in particular. It's easy to transpose digits by mistake, and this can lead to a huge misunderstanding. These types of mistakes could also have legal consequences.\n8. Print and sign your letter for mailing. Your letter will look more professional if printed on quality paper. Even if you send an email confirmation, mail an official signed copy as well. Sign the letter in the space provided, using blue or blank ink. Include any credentials, such as \"CPA\" or \"JD,\" if appropriate. Mail the letter promptly, so that your new employee will receive it well before their planned start date.Tip: It also looks more professional to type the envelope. Most word-processing apps have templates you can use to place the addresses correctly on the envelope.\n\n\n## Write a catholic confirmation letter\n\n1. Start with a statement about the importance of confirmation. The sacrament of Confirmation deepens baptismal grace, strengthening the bond between the confirmand and the Church. Address the confirmand personally, and congratulate them for taking this step and receiving this sacrament. For example, you might say \"As you prepare to receive the sacrament of Confirmation, I am honored to support you as you take this important step to deepen your bond with Christ and the Church.\" Use words and phrases from the Catholic Catechism to stress the importance of this step in the confirmand's journey of faith.\n2. Discuss your relationship with the recipient. Use shared memories and experiences to encourage and build up the confirmand. Supplement your stories with verses from Scripture or other sources. Choose stories or events that demonstrate your love for the recipient and their journey in the faith. For example, you might discuss memories of when the recipient was baptized. Questions the recipient may have asked you about the Church or about your faith are also good jumping-off points for reflection. Don't worry about making this long or overly detailed. Brevity can also be powerful.Tip: It may help to outline your letter before you start writing it. Be prepared to go through several drafts to get it right.\n3. Include encouraging or inspirational quotes from Scripture. Use quotes to further express the meaning of the sacrament and the teachings of the Church. You can search online or use the Bible's concordance to find quotes that resonate with you. For example, you might try \"The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.\" (Proverbs 18:10). Another encouraging quote is \"For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil and not for harm, to give you a future with hope.\" (Jeremiah 29:11). You might also try \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\" (Philippians 4:13).\n4. Assure the recipient that they have your support. Close your letter by letting the recipient know that you support them on their journey and are praying for them. Thank the recipient for being in your life and bringing you love and joy. For example, you might write \"I am extremely proud of you, and all the blessings you have brought to my life. I am honored to be your Confirmation sponsor, and pray that you will continue to grow in faith, hope, and charity. \"Variation: If you know the recipient's confirmation name, you might close your letter with a prayer to that saint.\n5. Write your final letter by hand to make it more personal. Formal letters are typically typed. However, a handwritten confirmation letter feels more personal and authentic, as though it came straight from the heart. This can be a great touch to add. If you're going to write your letter by hand, go slowly. Write as neatly as possible, and make sure you aren't introducing any errors. It can help to type your letter out first and then copy it.\n\n\n## Draft other formal confirmation letter\n\n1. Type your letter in formal business letter format. A formal business letter communicates that you are serious and sets the proper tone for your letter. Most word processing apps include a business letter template that you can use to type your confirmation letter. Use a standard font, such as Times New Roman or Arial. In a legal sense, a confirmation letter also may be used to create a record of an agreement made orally. The formal business letter format is appropriate, as these letters may be used as evidence in court. Because confirmation letters are typically extremely brief, you may find that your letter only has a single paragraph. It should never be longer than a page.\n2. Use an appropriate salutation. Typically you'll start the salutation line with the word \"dear,\" followed by \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" and the first and last name of the recipient of the letter. Place a colon at the end of the person's name to start the letter. If the person is a doctor, use \"Dr.\"\n\t* If you don't know the recipient's gender identity, simply use their first and last name. Don't use the abbreviation \"Mrs.\" unless you know the recipient is a married woman who prefers that title.\n3. Confirm the specific arrangement made. There's no reason for any extended introduction or pleasantries in a confirmation letter. Get straight to the point of the event or arrangement you're confirming. This will likely include dates, times, and locations. For example, you might start the letter \"This letter is to confirm\" or \"I am writing to confirm,\" followed by the information you're confirming. If you're writing to confirm receipt of something, you can start your letter \"I am pleased to confirm,\" or \"I was pleased to receive,\" followed by a list of the specific items you received.Err on the side of formality. You can be more personable when confirming a personal arrangement made with someone you know well. But generally, keep your tone formal and professional.\n4. Include any other important information. Other details may include the names and roles of other people involved, specific tasks, conditions of the arrangement, or monetary agreements. Repeat any terms or conditions that were part of the agreement to clarify what is expected. For example, if you're writing to confirm that the recipient will volunteer at a nonprofit event, you might want to include the day, time, and location of the event, as well as specific acts the volunteer will be expected to perform.\n5. Ask for a follow-up if needed. Towards the end of your letter, let the recipient know if you need them to contact you and provide additional information. If your confirmation included a request or an assignment of responsibilities, ask them to confirm their agreement on those terms. Even if you don't have anything specific for the person to contact you about, it's usually a good idea to include a line with your preferred method of communication and let them know that they can contact you if they have any further questions. For example, you might write \"If you have any questions or comments, you can reach me at (999) 444-1212.\"\n6. Thank the recipient. Start a new paragraph and add a line thanking the recipient for joining you in the arrangement or agreeing with you on the terms, whatever is appropriate to the subject of the letter. For example, if you are confirming someone's agreement to volunteer at a nonprofit event, you might say \"Thank you so much for your commitment to our cause. We are grateful for all of your effort.\" Make a statement of your enthusiasm, if appropriate. For example, if you are writing to confirm a job interview, you might say \"I appreciate the opportunity\" or \"I look forward to talking to you.\"\n7. Edit and proofread your letter before printing. Your confirmation letter won't be taken seriously if it includes typos or grammatical errors. In addition to proofreading, make sure your writing is as clear and concise as it can be. Reading your letter aloud can help you pick up on places where your writing could be simpler and more direct, as well as making it easier to notice mistakes. Edit out legalese or other industry jargon. Be clear and direct about what you're confirming.\n8. Print your letter on quality paper. Once you're confident your letter is error-free, print it on a premium, stationery paper. You can buy small quantities of this type of paper in office supply stores or online. If you're sending the letter in your capacity as an employee or representative of a business or organization, use the letterhead of that business or organization. However, if you're writing to confirm a personal matter, don't use the business letterhead \u2013 even if you own the business. Most word processing apps have templates you can use to create your own personal letterhead if you want your letter to look a little more polished.\n9. Sign the letter using blue or black ink. After you've printed the letter, sign it neatly in the space you provided over your typed name. Try to keep your signature professional and reasonably legible, without being excessively stylistic. Sign your first and last name exactly as it is typed. It's typically not appropriate to use a nickname or abbreviation when signing a confirmation letter.\n10. Send your letter to the recipient promptly. Try to get your letter in the mail the same day you sign it. You won't make a good impression if the date of your letter is several days before the date of the postmark. If the letter is confirming something that could possibly have legal significance, make a copy of the confirmation letter for your own records before you mail it.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A professional or academic seeking guidance on formal correspondence.

{"conversations": ["How to cut carbon arrows?", "Carbon arrows are a lightweight alternative to aluminum, but they may not always come in the correct length you need. While you can always take the arrows into a hunting store to have them cut by a professional, you can also cut arrows at home with a rotary cutter or an arrow saw. Before you cut the arrows, be sure to measure your draw length to know how long the shafts need to be. When you\u2019re finished, your arrows will be the perfect size!\n\n## Find the proper arrow length\n\n1. Hold a tape measure out to your side with your non-dominant hand. Grip the tape measure in your nondominant hand so the tape points toward your wrist. Fully extend your nondominant arm out to your side so it\u2019s parallel to the ground to simulate holding a bow. Make sure you can easily grab and pull the tape toward you, and reposition the tape measure in your hand if you can\u2019t. Avoid using a fabric tape measure since it may give you an inaccurate measurement.\n2. Pull the tape to the corner of your mouth with your dominant hand. Grab the end of the tape with your dominant hand and slowly pull it out. Keep pulling the tape until the end touches the corner of your mouth on the dominant side of your body. For example, pull it to the right corner of your mouth if you\u2019re right-handed. Once the tape measure is fully extended, look at the measurement. Pulling the tape measure to the corner of your mouth simulates drawing a bowstring so you can get an accurate measurement for your draw length.Tip: Put your nondominant thumb on the tape measure before checking the measurement so it doesn\u2019t retract. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to measure again.\n3. Add 2 in (5.1 cm) to your measurement to find the arrow length. If your arrow is too short, it could jam your bow or cause the arrow to shoot improperly. Take the draw length measurement you just found and include an extra 2 inches (5.1 cm) to ensure that the arrows are long enough for your bow. For example, if your draw length measurement was 29 inches (74 cm), then the length of your arrow should be 31 inches (79 cm).\n4. Transfer your measurement onto the arrow shaft. Start your measuring tape at the back of the arrow shaft and extend the tape toward the front. When you reach the measurement you found, use a marker to draw a line or dot on the arrow shaft so you know where to cut. Rotate the arrow 180 degrees and make another mark in the same place to use as reference. Don\u2019t include the arrow\u2019s nock in the measurement since nock sizes vary between arrows. Start at the base of the arrow shaft instead.\n\n\n## Use a rotary cutter\n\n1. Clamp a rotary cutter horizontally over the edge of the table. A rotary cutter is a handheld multitool that spins quickly to cut through materials. Use a rotary cutter with a circular carbide blade so it can easily cut through the carbon arrows without deforming them. Lay the rotary cutter horizontally so the blade is vertical and hangs over the edge of your work surface. Use a C-clamp to secure the tool to your work surface so it doesn\u2019t shift around while you\u2019re using it. You can buy a rotary cutter from your local hardware store.Tip: Make sure you can easily access the power switch on the tool so you can turn it on and off when you need it.\n2. Position the hose of a shop vacuum behind the rotary blade. Cutting carbon arrows creates dust that can cause irritation if you breathe it in, so it\u2019s easiest to vacuum it immediately to prevent it from spreading. Set the end of the hose on your work surface so it\u2019s directly behind the rotary cutter\u2019s blade. Connect the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum. You can also use your regular vacuum if you don\u2019t have a shop vacuum available.\n3. Put on safety glasses and a face mask before turning the machines on. Carbon dust can cause irritation if it gets in your eyes or lungs, so it\u2019s important to stay protected while you work. Put on safety glasses that cover your eyes completely, and a face mask that guards your nose and mouth. Once you put on your safety equipment, you can start the rotary tool and the vacuum. Even though you have a vacuum capturing most of the dust, there still may be particles floating around.\n4. Cut the arrow along the mark you made. Once your rotary tool is spinning at full speed, carefully guide the arrow so the blade lines up with the marks you made earlier. Push the shaft gently against the blade so it cuts into the carbon. Continue pushing the arrow into the blade until it cuts completely through the other side. If the blade has difficulty cutting the arrow straight through, try rotating the arrow while you hold it against the blade to make it easier.\n\n\n## Cut shaft with an arrow saw\n\n1. Attach a shop vacuum hose to the port on the back of an arrow saw. Many arrow saws have a port on the back where you can attach a vacuum hose to collect dust. Push the end of a shop vacuum hose into the dust collection port on the arrow saw until it\u2019s secured in place. Attach the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum. You can buy arrow saws from hunting supply stores or you can order them online. Arrow saws usually cost around $130 USD. You can use your regular vacuum if you don\u2019t have access to a shop vacuum.Tip: If your arrow saw doesn\u2019t have a port for a vacuum hose, then set the hose as close to the blade as you can.\n2. Wear safety glasses and a face mask while you\u2019re cutting arrows. Carbon arrows create carbon fiber dust when you cut them, which can be irritating if you inhale it or if it gets in your eyes. Wear safety glasses that cover your eyes completely and put on a face mask to protect your mouth and nose. Once you have the face mask and safety glasses on, you can turn on your machines.\n3. Position the arrow on the saw so the back sits inside of the notch on the support. Your arrow saw will have a support with a notch on it so your arrow doesn\u2019t roll around while you\u2019re cutting it. Set the back of the arrow in the notch and line up the front of the arrow so the mark you made on the shaft lines up with the saw blade. Your arrow saw may have multiple supports on it. If so, make sure the arrow sits in all of the notches to ensure you make a straight cut.\n4. Rotate the arrow while it\u2019s against the saw blade to cut completely through it. Once your arrow saw is running at full speed, slowly push the arrow shaft into the blade. Once it starts cutting into the arrow, spin the arrow so the blade cuts around the circumference of the shaft. As soon as you around the circumference of the arrow, the end will fall off and you can turn off your saw. Your arrow saw may be powerful enough to cut through the shaft without rotating it.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an archer or bowhunter with a keen interest in sustainable practices.

Meeting the Section 508* requirements for Web pages used in such a course is effectively without cost if one starts out to make such pages accessible. Retrofitting might cost as much as the original project, but the cost should be near zero for modern MOOCs.\n\n* Captioning and Transcripts: Closed (or open) captions are very expensive. Unless done at a foreign sweatshop, cost is $5.00 to $15.00 per minute, so something like $12,000 as a minimum, up over $35,000, for a one-semester course. In other words, the captioning can cost more than the professor. That's at least part of why some institutions employ ASL interpreters for class sections with deaf students. The $5-15 number given above could be reduced by using student labor, especially if the students are majors in the material being subtitled. In addition, captioning through voice recognition is getting much better, but still requires certain amount of manual editing. \n\n* Audio Descriptions: Making course materials available to the blind means being sure that everything that is shown is also described, either by the speaker who is presenting or in a manner that can be rendered through text-to-speech. The latter means being sure that there are good \"alt\" descriptions of images and that appropriate markup, e.g. MathML, is used for things like equations. In disciplines like computing, that isn't onerous, and the costs may disappear in the weeds of getting the course done. Things might be very different in a discipline like the visual arts.\n\n* Screen Reader Compatibility: Ensuring that the MOOC is compatible with screen readers and assistive technologies can involve additional development and testing efforts. This cost may vary depending on the complexity of the course platform and its current level of accessibility.\n\nIt is recommended to consult with accessibility experts, organizations specializing in accessible design, or accessibility consultants who can provide more accurate estimates based on the specific requirements of your MOOC.

There are some examples of ancient cultures exhausting natural resources available to them - Pitcairn Island Polynesians, Ancient Puebloans (Anasazi). It's the cause of the semi-nomadic way of life of many early societies - your herds graze the grass into oblivion, you move to another patch to return back when the grass grows back in; or you deplete the soil by overplanting, you move to another spot of land and start over, and so on.\n\nBut there's an important distinction to be made.

When food grows scarce, hunger strikes, and humans either start fighting for what's left, reducing population to more manageable levels, or migrate to not yet depleted lands - only cases of actual extinction are from island civilizations which cannot readily move. Meanwhile, globally environment stays balanced, and depleted spots are replenished from outside - slowly healing the damage. Modern humanity has no place to move - all land is already claimed by someone, so we have to make do with what resources we have - and consequently affects the world at global scale, which earlier cultures were incapable of.\n\nSustainability is not about return to pre-industrial way of life - it is unsustainable at modern population levels.

{"conversations": ["How to handle poking wires on braces?", "Poking wires on braces are a very common  and irritating problem. These can cause sores and small cuts and abrasions on your gums and cheeks. Reducing discomfort is the first goal of dealing with this problem, followed by fixing the wire. While there are some ways you can fix poking wires at home, you should always see your orthodontist or dentist to follow up. In most cases, your orthodontist will want to replace a broken wire or cut any long pieces of wire that are poking you.\n\n## Use orthodontic wax\n\n1. Get some orthodontic wax. Your orthodontist should have supplied you with some when you got your braces. If you have run out, you can buy it at most pharmacies. Orthodontic wax comes in small cases containing long strips of wax. If you cannot find wax at a pharmacy, call your orthodontist for some.\n2. Remove a small amount of wax from one of the wax strips. It should be about the size of a small pea. Roll the small piece of wax between your fingers until it is a smooth ball. Make sure your hands are clean and dry before touching the wax. Use only new, unused wax on your braces.\n3. Make sure the wire or bracket that is poking you is dry and clean. It can help to brush your teeth carefully to remove any food or debris from the wires, before applying wax. To dry your braces, hold your lips or cheeks away from the area with poking wires. Let it air dry for a few seconds or use sterile gauze and place it between the brackets and the inside surface of your lip to dry. You can now apply the wax.\n4. Apply the orthodontic wax ball to the poking wire. All you have to do is press it onto the offending area. Put the ball of wax on your fingertip. Touch the wax to the poking wire or bracket. Press down gently to cover the wire. Pressure on your teeth or braces while receiving orthodontic treatment can cause some discomfort. If you feel soreness while pressing on the wire this is completely normal.\n5. Remove the wax before eating or brushing your teeth. You don't want the wax to get into your food while you eat. Discard any used wax immediately. Replace it with new wax after eating or brushing your teeth. Continue to use the wax until you can see your orthodontist or dentist to fix the wire. If you do happen to swallow the wax, that's okay. It won't harm you.\n\n\n## Fix a poke wire\n\n1. Try to bend thinner poking wires using the eraser end of a pencil. You won't be able to fix all poking wires this way, but this method will help in many cases. Find the wire in your mouth that is poking you. If it is a thin wire, get a pencil with a clean eraser. Gently touch the eraser to the poking wire. Push the wire gently to bend it. Try to tuck the poking wire behind the arch wire. Only do this for thinner, more flexible wires.\n2. Use tweezers to fix poking wires in the back of your mouth. Sometimes, eating hard foods can cause flexible wires in the back of your mouth to slip out of the bracket slots on the back teeth. If this occurs, you can try to fix these with tweezers. Get a small pair of thin nosed tweezers. Make sure they are clean before using them in your mouth. Grab the end of the poking or loose wire with the tweezers. Guide it back into the tube on the bracket slot. If you can't get the wire back into the slot, you will need to call your orthodontist.\n3. Fix broken laces that poke your lips using tweezers and pliers. You will need to see your orthodontist to follow up for a replacement. If the wire lacing of your braces is broken in the front of your mouth, you can try to tuck the broken lace behind the arch wire or around a bracket. Use tweezers to bend the wire away from your lips and cheeks. If the lace is on top of the arch wire you can can also remove it by cutting it with pliers. This is only recommended as a last option and should be followed by a visit to the orthodontist as soon as possible.\n\n\n## Treat cut and sores\n\n1. Use a rinse to clean your mouth. This can help to treat any sores or cuts caused by poking wires. Dissolve one teaspoon of salt in one cup of lukewarm water. Use this as a mouthwash by swishing around your mouth for 60 seconds. This may sting at first, but it will help to relieve prolonged discomfort and prevent infection. Repeat this four to six times a day.\n2. Avoid foods that are acidic, sugary, or hard to eat. Instead, eat a soft, bland diet. Eat foods such as mashed potatoes, yogurt, and soups. Avoid coffee, spicy foods, chocolate, citrus fruits or juices, nuts, seeds, and tomatoes. These foods are high in acid and can aggravate any sores or cuts from your wires.\n3. Drink cold water or iced tea. Cold (unsweetened) beverages can help ease the pain from sores. Use a straw to sip a cold drink, taking care not to scrape the cut or sore. You can also eat popsicles to apply cold to the sore. Alternatively, suck on an ice cube. Let the ice sit on the cut or sore for a few seconds at a time.\n4. Put an oral anesthetic gel onto any sores or cuts. These can help relieve any discomfort from poking wires temporarily. You can buy Orajel or Anbesol at most pharmacies. Put a small amount of the gel on the end of a q-tip. Rub the gel over any sores or cuts in your mouth. You can reapply the gel three or four times each day.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned parent or a teenage orthodontic patient who is seeking advice on dealing with uncomfortable situations related to their braces, such as poking wires.

{"conversations": ["How to buy school supplies?", "Shopping for school supplies can be stressful for both the seasoned shopper and the beginner. Working parents or guardians have to fight the crowds that gather on weekends or after the end of the workday. Even worse, the cost of school supplies steadily increases every year, costing families an average of just under $100 in 2015. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to stress out or go bankrupt. By spacing out your purchases and practicing a few money-saving hacks, you can survive the back-to-school madness.\n\n## Buy basic supply\n\n1. Get a list from your child\u2019s school. Don\u2019t rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isn\u2019t available on the school\u2019s website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites.\n2. Know the difference between requests and requirements. Before you panic over the long supply list on the school\u2019s website, realize that many of the items are merely requests. One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.\n3. Purchase writing supplies. Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper. Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art. Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but it\u2019s always a good idea to check the supply list in case your child\u2019s teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners. Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.\n4. Buy folders. Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc. ).\n5. Purchase a day planner. Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.\n6. Buy art supplies. Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.\n7. Purchase personal supplies. Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack. Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.\n8. Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag. Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time. However, textbooks haven\u2019t gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.\n\n\n## Shop for electronics\n\n1. Buy a calculator. High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:\n\t* Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30. Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.\n2. Purchase a computer. High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list. Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget.\n3. Buy external storage. Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.\n\n\n## Save money\n\n1. Sort out what you already have. Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldn\u2019t mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s). Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt. Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.\n2. Stick to basics and generics. Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Don\u2019t worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs.\n3. Take advantage of discounts. Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back. Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.\n4. Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks. Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.\n5. Buy refurbished. Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost. However, you should do your homework first. Only buy refurbished products from trusted retailers like Apple or Best Buy, which offer warranties and free repairs on known issues.\n6. Buy a little at a time throughout the year. There\u2019s no rule that you have to buy school supplies in July and August. Each time you\u2019re shopping for groceries or picking up a prescription, stop by the school supply aisle to look for unannounced discounts on common required supplies.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally-conscious small business owner or manager seeking practical strategies to minimize their carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable future.

{"conversations": ["How do weather models work?", "All numerical atmospheric models are built around calculations derived from primitive equations that describe atmospheric flow. Vilhelm Bjerknes discovered the relationships and thereby became the father of numerical weather prediction. Conceptually, the equations can be thought of as describing how a parcel of air would move in relationship to its surroundings. For instance, we learn at a young age that hot air rises. The hydrostatic vertical momentum equation explains why and quantifies under what condictions hot air would stop rising. (As the air rises it expands and cools until it reaches hydrostatic equilibrium.) The other equations consider other types of motion and heat transfer.\n\nUnfortunately, the equations are nonlinear, which means that you can't simply plug in a few numbers and get useful results. Instead, weather models are simulations which divide the atmosphere into three-dimensional grids and calculate how matter and energy will flow from one cube of space into another during discrete time increments. Actual atmospheric flow is continuous, not discrete, so by necessity the models are approximations. Different models make different approximations appropriate to their specific purpose.\n\nNumerical models have been improving over time for several reasons:\n\n* More and better input data,\n* Tighter grids, and\n* Better approximations.\n\nIncreasing computational power has allowed models to use smaller grid boxes. However, the number of computations increases exponentially with the number of boxes and the process suffers diminishing returns. On the input end of things, more and better sensors improve the accuracy of the initial conditions of the model. Synoptic scale and mesoscale models take input from General Circulation Models, which helps set reasonable intial conditions. On the output end, Model Output Statistics do a remarkable job of estimating local weather by comparing the current model state with historical data of times when the model showed similar results.

A microchip is a tiny transponder that uses radiofrequency waves to transmit information on the chip about your pet when scanned. It is implemented painlessly just under the skin using a large-bore needle by veterinarians and some shelters. Once your dog has a microchip, you must register with the company the microchip is made by; now, if your dog arrives at a shelter, (s)he will be scanned and the microchip will give the shelter your phone number to contact you with. Your microchip must have recent contact information; if it does not, simply contact the microchip company to update your information.\n2. Brush up on your dog\u2019s training. Your dog should have basic obedience training, and should easily respond to you. The most vital commands to train are walking on a leash, \u201ccome,\u201d and \u201cleave it,\u201d in addition to crate training. If your puppy is young and hasn\u2019t been leash trained, and you intend to bring the dog to parades/parties/fireworks displays, now is the time to do this. For information on leash training, read this wikiHow article. Your recall command should be rock-solid. If your dog runs off in reaction to fireworks, or after an interesting smell, you must be able to recall him. A related command is \u201cstay\u201d; for information on teaching this, read this article. During parties or parades, your dog is likely to come across yummy food that\u2019s unhealthy for him to eat. To prevent him from eating anything he shouldn't, your \u201cleave it\u201d command should be very good. Another useful, related command is \u201cdrop it\u201d; for information on teaching this, read this article. A crate is a useful tool during 4th of July celebrations, serving both to safely contain the dog and often calm him/her. For information on crate training, read this article.\n3. Plan your party carefully. Choose decorations carefully \u2013 glow sticks, which are both toxic for dogs and enticingly similar to colorful chew toys, are particularly dangerous. As beer and other human food and drink are toxic for dogs, decide on a place to keep your dog(s) during the party, such as in the house if the party is in the yard. If the dog is friendly and would like to stay with the people, consider keeping him with you leashed; contained by keeping him in a room with a baby gate barring passage if the party is inside; or securely tying him to a tree, fence, or other secure object if the party is outside. Before the party, research what foods are toxic to dogs. For information on avoiding foods toxic to dogs, read this article.\n4. Contact a veterinarian. For owners of dogs that are extremely reactive to fireworks or other typical Independence Day activities, the best option may be to discuss ways to help your dog with an experienced veterinarian. Topics to discuss include reducing stress for older dogs and the option of sedating the dog using safe drugs.\n5. Consider moving your dog. If your dog is extremely stressed by Independence Day activities, the best option may be to move him to another place for the duration of the celebrations or during the most active part (such as a parade). It may be possible to locate a \u201cdoggy hotel,\u201d friend or relative in a quiet rural area willing to keep the dog; however, expect there to be at least some amount of fireworks or parties, and it can be difficult to locate a business or person willing to care for your dog during the celebrations.\n6. Investigate products that may serve to calm your dog. A commercial product of \u201canxiety wrap,\u201d has been used with great success. Created by behavioral experts, such an item can calm dogs in a manner similar to swaddling an infant. A crate can be very useful, as stated above. As wolves naturally occupied dens, a dog will find comfort in his own \u201cden,\u201d or a crate. To increase the darkness, cover the crate with a blanket, leaving part of it uncovered so the dog can see passing people and breathe fresh air. It is possible to purchase relaxing auditory CDs that have been clinically researched to calm anxious dogs; these can be helpful for calming dogs frightened by Independence Day celebrations. Ask your veterinarian for more advice.\n\n\n## Party\n\n1. Secure your dog in the pre-decided place, if applicable. If he is going into a crate, place the crate in a quiet area of the house and put a safe bone, favorite toy, or other treats inside to occupy the dog. The dog will go in for the treat; once he or she is in, drape a dark-colored blanket over the crate to create darkness. Praise him and close windows and doors; you can also play a TV, radio, iPod, etc. to cover the sound of the party, or use the soothing music. If the dog is staying in the house, choose a room where the dog will be able to see the people but which people will not enter (for example, an office or study). Leave something to keep him occupied, and consider playing music/etc.\n2. If the dog will be staying with you, keep him away from food. Avoid tables, where scraps can lay or food can sit tantalizingly close. If a guest offers your dog food, politely inform your guest that human food can be toxic for dogs and that you would prefer for your dog not to eat any. Guests, especially children, might ask you if they can walk or pet the dog; if they do, tell them that feeding the dog food is not allowed. Do not leave the dog unattended \u2013 this is particularly dangerous outside, where stray fireworks can land or the dog can bolt from if fireworks go off or there is another loud noise.\n3. Stay calm and alert. You\u2019ll want to be on the lookout for anything that could scare your dog, but keep in mind that your dog can sense your emotions and will often copy them. For example: If you\u2019re on edge and nervous, your dog will sense this and be on edge and nervous as well. Clearly, you can\u2019t control your guests\u2019 behavior, but take the following precautions:\n\t* Stay aware of the effect of the party\u2019s tone on your dog. If your dog starts to become anxious or overly active, the best option can be to put him in a separate room, crate, etc. Ask kids to play away from your dog. Children running around can be especially upsetting for a dog, and it\u2019s a good idea to ask any kids upsetting your dog to quiet down or play in a separate area.\n4. Watch out for stray fireworks. These are an unfortunate danger in places where fireworks have been set off or have been set off nearby, and it\u2019s wise to stay on guard for any, as fireworks are unpredictable and can be highly dangerous.\n\n\n## Parade\n\n1. Consider leaving your dog at home. Parades can be stressful, and often the best option is to leave him at home in a crate or room, as described in the section on parties. If you don\u2019t want to leave your dog alone, another option is to leave him with friends or family not attending. However, if you do decide to bring your dog with you, follow the steps below to keep your dog as calm and safe as possible.\n2. Purchase or gather the supplies you may need. These include:\n\t* A crate for securing your dog. A secure leash and collar. A harness or controlling item such as a head collar might be preferred, as your dog may pull. A muzzle. This is a necessary safety precaution, as the sights and sounds of a parade can distress your dog to the point of biting. A collapsible water bowl and water. Your pet must be kept hydrated, as should you.\n3. Introduce your dog to the parade gradually. Though you likely won\u2019t be able to follow through a complete desensitization due to lack of time, you can introduce your dog gradually \u2013 at first, simply allow him to adjust to the sight, smell, and noise of the crowd at a closer and closer distance, and the parade using the same rules.\n4. Keep your dog under control. You should only bring a dog to a parade if he has been obedience trained, but even if he has been, keep a closer eye on your dog than usual. Watch for signs that your dog is uneasy or upset; if the parade upsets your dog too much, you can take him away from the parade or, if possible, set up a crate in a secure location.\n5. Keep your dog as safe as possible. Keeping your dog in a car is never a safe option, as the heat can give your dog heatstroke \u2013 or even kill him \u2013 and water must be provided regularly to prevent heat stroke and keep your dog hydrated. Read this article for information on treating heat stroke.\n\n\n## Firework show\n\n1. Consider leaving your dog at home. As with parades, fireworks can be upsetting and even dangerous for dogs. Dogs who are startled by them can run off and escape, and, even if they have an up-to-date tag and microchip, are not guaranteed to be found or returned. Optionally, you can consult a veterinarian for information on drugging your dog, but in general, bringing your dog is discouraged, and should only be done if your dog:\n\t* Has heard fireworks before and did not strongly react to them;\n\t* Has an up-to-date tag and microchip;\n\t* Has basic obedience training; \u201ccome\u201d in particular must be rock-solid; and\n\t* Is calm around crowds, playing kids, other dogs, and various other features of fireworks.\n2. Gather your supplies. These are the same as in the section on parades.\n3. Train your dog. If your dog appears anxious, do not reassure him \u2013 this will reward him for bad behavior, as in essence he is receiving a yummy treat when he is afraid, telling him that he should be afraid. Instead, give him attention and a treat whenever he is calm; you are now telling him that being calm is good. Use small treats easily swallowed with a strong scent to distract the dog.\n4. Keep an eye on your dog. Signs of anxiety include the dog licking his lips, whimpering, a tense position, and showing the whites of his eyes; if these occur, quietly and calmly remove the dog from the situation. Keep your dog hydrated; bring along a collapsible water bowl and bottles of water and offer water to your dog occasionally. Keep in mind that he may be too stressed to drink \u2013 if this happens, the best option may be to remove your dog from the situation. If your dog is calm, you can distract him with treats, a Kong toy stuffed with peanut butter, a favorite toy, or any other desirable object.\n5. Be prepared to leave. If your dog is too stressed by the fireworks, the best option is to immediately leave for your home. If you\u2019re attending the fireworks with others, tell them in advance that you may have to leave if your dog becomes too anxious. At home, have a crate set up in the same manner described in the section on parties. Keep in mind that a car is not a safe option for putting your dog in, as the heat levels can kill him/her; instead, the safest option is to leave with your dog and place him in the crate. Once he\u2019s settled in, you can return to the fireworks and have fun.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned pet owner or animal lover who is seeking advice on ensuring the safety and well-being of their dog during the noisy and potentially stressful Fourth of July celebrations.

{"conversations": ["How to celebrate chuseok?", "\"\ucd94\uc11d\" or \"Chuseok\" is a Korean harvest festival celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar. It is a very popular festival for Koreans as they reunite with their relatives and prepare for a feast. The origin of Chuseok is unsure but it has some traditional rites to be maintained. Thus Chuseok is celebrated in the rich harvest season when fruit and grain are abundant. Using the newly harvested rice, people make steamed rice, rice cakes, and liquor.\n\n## Pray and traditional customs\n\n1. Perform Charye or \ucc28\ub840. This is an ancestral memorial service where the entire family gathers together to perform the memorial service in the morning wearing hanbok. Charye is performed because Koreans believe that their ancestors aren't physically dead; their spirits are still alive. They prepare special food in their honor. Observe the important table arrangement for the Charye feast. Rice and soup are placed on the north side of the table, and fruits and vegetables are on the south. On the west and in the middle, meat dishes are served. On the east, rice cake and some drinks such as makgeolli or soju are placed.\n2. Practice Beolcho \"\ubc8c\ucd08\" and Seongmyo \"\uc131\ubb18\". Visit the ancestral graves and clean the weeds around the graves. This shows respect and devotion to one another. One month prior to the Chuseok, the families visit their ancestors' graves to clean the weeds, a practice which is called Beolcho, often causing congestion in Korea's highways. They again visit and clean the weeds around the graves during Chuseok.\n\n\n## Entertainment\n\n1. Play Ssireum. A Korean folk game similar to wrestling, it is extremely popular during the festival. Two competitors wrestle in the center of a sandpit and try to knock the other person over by using strength, skill and intelligence. It is a one on one tournament and the last person remaining wins the game.\n2. Perform the folk dance Kanggangsullae. This is a folk dance especially performed by women. They usually link arms and dance in a circle under the moonlight.\n3. Perform Sonori or Geobuknori. \"So\" and \"Geobuk\" literally mean \"cow\" and \"turtle\" in Hangeul. This celebration is a ritual performed by two people wearing a cape made of hanji and running around the local area as a cow and turtle, asking for foods from neighbors. The foods are often shared with relatives who can't afford Chuseok meals.\n\n\n## Food\n\n1. Eat songpyeon or \"\uc1a1\ud3b8\". This is a Korean traditional stuffed rice cake served as the Chuseok meal. The stuffings are made of healthy ingredients like sesame seeds, beans, nuts and honey. It is crucial to steam those cakes on pine-needles. It enhances the taste and fragrance along with the meaning of Songpyeon. Songpyeon is also significant because of the meaning contained in its shape. Songpyeon's rice skin itself resembles the shape of a full moon, but once it wraps the stuffing, its shape resembles the half-moon. There's a saying that the prettier you shape your songpyeon, the prettier your future daughter will be.\n2. Enjoy Hangwa. It is made with highly nutritious ingredients, such as rice flour, honey, fruit, and roots. People use edible natural ingredients to express various colors, flavors, and tastes. A few types of Hangwa are Yakgwa, Yugwa and Dasik, which are widely common as Korean confectionery items.\n3. Note that the name \"Hangwa\" is similar to another name for Chuseok, \"Hangawi\".\n4. Drink traditional liquors. These drinks are another significant and traditional side for a Chuseok feast. On Chuseok, families and relatives gather together and hold a memorial service for their ancestors with liquor made of the newly harvest rice. After the memorial service, they sit together and spend some time together as a family, drinking the liquor and eating the food.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual with an interest in Indian culture and traditions, seeking to learn about the customs and practices associated with Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.

{"conversations": ["How to dress nice every day (for girls)?", "Dressing nicely each day can take some effort but will ultimately be worth it if your outfits make you feel confident and happy. If you want to look great every day, you will first have to go through your wardrobe and fill it with classic outfit staples. Looking awesome also involves some planning and accessorizing that may take some getting used to but will ultimately result in some stylish outfits.\n\n## Fill your wardrobe\n\n1. Buy classic pieces. To dress nicely, it is important to have some classic pieces in your wardrobe that will never go out of style. Classic pieces are articles of clothing that are generally not too extreme or dated. Instead, they are generally simple and elegant, like a navy blue blazer or a well-crafted black V-neck t-shirt. Though they may sound simple, you can always dress these pieces up with accessories. Basic, classic pieces are generally easier to mix and match, which means that they can be used in a variety of outfits.\n2. Purchase a few accent articles of clothing. To go along with your classic articles of clothing, buy some accent pieces that will make your outfits pop, even if they are simple. These accents could be bright colors that you don\u2019t normally wear or patterns that pop. For example, you could take an outfit that is as simple as a white t-shirt and a navy blue skirt, and make it interesting with a patterned sweater.\n3. Purchase clothes that you can mix and match. When going through your wardrobe, consider whether or not you can use each article of clothing in at least two different outfits. Mixing and matching is an important part of dressing nicely everyday. While you most likely can\u2019t purchase a new outfit for every day of the week, you can buy clothing that you can mix and match to create entirely new and exciting outfits.\n4. Consider your body when picking out your clothes. Certain clothes have cuts that look different on different body types. Look for clothes that flatter your body and make you feel confident. Each person has their idea of what they find flatters their bodies the most, so spend some time trying on different kinds of clothes. For example:\n\t* If you have a \u2018Pear\u2019 shape, which means that you have wider hips and a slimmer bust, you could try out an open-neck top, or a dress with an empire waist.\n5. Get rid of clothes that are worn or torn. Part of dressing nicely means giving away or selling old clothes. Clothes get worn out, especially if you wear the same piece a lot, and worn-out clothing does not necessarily look very classy\u2014unless you are going for a look that involves faded clothes and torn jeans. If you find that a shirt has a stain, try your best to get it out, but if the stain remains, it might be time to toss the shirt. Clothes with stains tend to look a little sloppy.\n6. Consider your skin tone when buying your clothes. Picking out clothing that complements your skin tone can make a great outfit that much nicer. Of course, always keep in mind that if you don\u2019t like a color or don\u2019t feel like it looks good on you, don\u2019t wear it. Part of dressing nicely is dressing in things that make you confident and happy; if a certain color matches your skin tone, but you don\u2019t like it anyway, don\u2019t wear it. General guidelines for skin tones and clothing colors include:\n\t* Very light skin tones: Ice tones, pale pinks, greys, baby blues, navies, and grass greens. Medium-light skin tones: Pastel colors, cool reds, and blues. Avoid orange. Medium skin tones: Metallic tones, jewel tones, plums, wine reds, bright blues, deep purples. Medium-dark skin tones: Deep colors like dark greens, bright blues, pale yellows, warm reds. Very dark skin tones: Bright colors like burgundies, cobalt blue, bright orange, and red.\n7. Hang up your clothes and invest in an iron. Another part of dressing nicely is keeping your clothes in tip-top shape. This means hanging up clothes when you can, and ironing folded clothes. If you are not sure how to iron your clothes, click here. You can also try steam pressing your clothes.\n\n\n## Plan your outfit\n\n1. Plan your outfits. One aspect of dressing nicely is taking the time to plan your outfits. This might mean planning your outfit the night before, or planning an entire week\u2019s worth of outfits at the beginning of the week; go with what works best for you. Trying to figure out a great outfit in the morning before school may make you feel a little too stressed, so take some time to consider your wardrobe and try on several different outfits that you could wear. Some girls find that trying out outfits and taking photos of the ones that they like to put in a binder can help them to decide on an outfit when they are in a rush. If you plan a last-minute outing with your friends, simply flip through the binder and pick out a pre-planned outfit.\n2. Consider the occasion you are dressing for. When planning your outfit, think about what you will be doing in that outfit. Different events call for different kinds of clothing. For instance, if you\u2019re going to school, try not to show too much skin, or wear a shirt that is too low cut. On the other hand, if you\u2019re going to the beach with your friends, wearing a summery dress and shoes you can walk through the sand with maybe the way to go. If you are not sure what would be appropriate to wear to a certain event, such as a cousin's baptism, or a job interview, don\u2019t be afraid to ask friends or family for advice.\n3. Wear clothing that makes you feel confident. When picking out your outfit, make sure that you feel good in your clothes. Ultimately, you should be dressing nicely for yourself rather than dressing for anyone else. It is important to feel comfortable and happy in the clothes that you are wearing; projecting confidence and enthusiasm will give your outfit that extra, energetic boost. Try to keep in mind that if someone only likes you when you are dressed up, that person might not have their priorities straight. First and foremost, dress the way that you want to dress.\n4. Try to avoid combining patterns. While you may be able to get away with some very subtle pattern combinations, it is generally a good idea to only have one pattern in your outfit. Clashing patterns can often make an outfit look sloppy. For instance, if you were wearing an argyle sweater, you would most likely want to avoid wearing that sweater with a striped skirt.\n5. Consider using the rule of three. If you are having trouble putting together an outfit, using the \u2018rule of three\u2019 can help you to create a quick but elegant ensemble in no time. When using the rule of three, pick out three colors: two that will be your base colors (most likely your shirt and pants or skirt) and one that will be your accent color. Your base colors could be subtler colors that go together well, such as a navy blue shirt and camel skirt. Your accent color should be a brighter color that makes the rest of your outfit pop, such as a red thin belt or a silver-laced scarf.\n6. Try to wear something extra cute at least once a week. While you may want to look nice every day of the week, throwing on an outfit that dazzles once a week can help to make you feel that much more well-dressed. Take the time to come up with this eye-catching ensemble.\n7. Try to avoid wearing the same outfit twice in a week. While this will not be possible if you have to wear a school uniform, or a uniform for work, try to avoid wearing the same outfit two times a week if you are planning on hanging out or being seen by the same people. If you have two different parties to go to, however, and the people at these parties won\u2019t overlap, feel free to consider wearing the same great outfit. By no means does this mean that you avoid wearing the same article of clothing twice a week. If you have a skirt that works well in two different outfits, feel free to rock both of these ensembles in the same week. Remember, mixing and matching is the key to making you feel like you have an endless wardrobe.\n8. Create an emergency outfit. Some days, you might find that you just don\u2019t want to wear the outfit you have planned. On those days, it's important to have an emergency backup outfit. This outfit should be simple, comfortable, and easy to accessorize with. For example, your emergency outfit could be a pair of nice jeans, a tank top in your favorite color, and a cropped sweater. With these basic items already put together, all you need to go is add a necklace, scarf, or rocking pair of shoes and you\u2019ll be good to go.\n\n\n## Accessorizing\n\n1. Pick out some shoes that will look classy. If you are shopping for shoes, try to pick out a couple of pairs that can be worn with most of your outfits. These could be classic black flats, a nice pair of boots, or short wedges that you can wear with your skirts and dresses. Try on the shoes and make sure you can walk in them easily; if you are planning on wearing them with many of your outfits, it\u2019s important to be able to walk in them.\n2. Wear shoes that would for the occasion. As with your clothes, consider the event you are going to when picking out the shoes you will wear that day. In certain formal events, sandals might not be appropriate, while wearing high heels at school might make it hard to get from class to class on time.\n3. Keep your shoes looking brand new. If your shoes get damaged or scuffed, try to buff the marks out, or use polishes to make your shoes look shiny and new again. Part of looking nice is being dressed well\u2014from your head to your feet. If you are not sure how to clean your shoes, take a look at some of the following articles:\n\t* Shine shoes\n\t* Polish shoes\n\t* Wash shoes\n4. Try out different kinds of jewelry. Accessorizing can help to take your outfit to a whole new level. When creating outfits for yourself, try on different kinds of jewelry and see how they change or affect the outfit you are wearing. Sometimes, adding a statement necklace or chandelier earrings can take your outfit from nice to outstanding. However, try not to over-accessorize. For example, if you are planning on wearing a chunky necklace, try wearing a small pair of stud earrings, rather than a pair of dangling earrings that could make your jewelry feel overbearing.\n5. Consider where you want the focus to be when accessorizing. Jewelry can draw a person\u2019s eye, which can be both a great thing and an unwanted thing. For example, if you want your focus to be on your face, wear large or dangling earrings. If you want the focus to be on the rest of your outfit, consider wearing a longer necklace that ties your whole outfit together. However, if you are wearing a low-cut shirt, try to refrain from wearing a longer necklace, as it might draw too much attention to your chest area.\n6. Try out different kinds of accessories. Accessories are not just limited to jewelry and shoes. You can spice up an outfit by adding an accent scarf, a colorful belt, or a stylish hat. Play around with different kinds of accessories that fit into your style.\n7. Create your own \u2018golden rule\u2019. The \u2018golden rule\u2019 refers to the maximum number of accessories you will allow yourself. This is completely based on your own opinion. Some people like to layer necklaces and wear funky shoes. Others, prefer a chic minimalist style in which you choose one or two accessories that compliment your outfit. Remember that you can change your golden rule when you feel like it doesn\u2019t reflect your personality anymore. For instance, maybe you like wearing three necklaces and a bunch of bracelets, but during the year your preferences chance and you decide to limit yourself to three accessories; go with what will make you feel happy and confident.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A fashion-conscious individual, possibly a young woman, seeking advice on improving her daily outfit choices to appear more stylish and confident.

It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries. And it creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production.\nSo in most cases, protecting the environment and promoting economic growth go hand-in-hand.

Your doctor can fully explain the procedure, as well as what you can expect afterward. They'll also discuss the risks of the surgery. Tell your doctor why you want the surgery so that they can help you avoid disappointment. The doctor will ask about your health and well-being before approving you for the procedure. Bring a detailed medical history, including conditions you're being treated for. Tell the doctor if you're seeing a therapist. If you're undergoing treatment for a condition related to your decision to get a vaginoplasty, such as body image issues, it's best to tell the doctor. Provide the doctor with a list of any medications you're taking, including the dosage amounts. Ask about your needs post-surgery. This includes what you should expect at the hospital and during the days after the surgery.\n2. Get a blood test. Your doctor will want to do a few simple tests to make sure you're healthy enough for surgery. First, they'll do a simple blood test, which is virtually painless. This lets them check your hemoglobin and health profile to ensure that you are healthy. They may also do a pregnancy test, as you won't be able to get a vaginoplasty if you're pregnant.\n3. Undergo a urine test. The doctor will also do a urinalysis to make sure that you're healthy. This is a simple, painless test. You'll just need to urinate in a cup, and the medical staff will take care of the rest!\n4. Confirm that you aren't pregnant and don't want more kids. You should not get a vaginoplasty if you want to have more children or if you're pregnant. In this case, it's best for you to wait until you're finished having children. Your doctor will likely ask you to confirm that you aren't pregnant and don't plan to become pregnant. The doctor may also choose to do a pregnancy test before allowing you to get the surgery.\n\n\n## Arrange your surgery\n\n1. Contact your insurance provider to check your coverage. Many insurance companies won't cover a vaginoplasty, as it's usually considered an elective procedure. This means you may have to pay for it out of pocket. If you're not sure you can afford the procedure, ask your doctor if they offer a payment plan. You can also look into CareCredit, a line of credit opened specifically for elective medical procedures. CareCredit requires an application similar to that of most credit cards.\n2. Make a budget for how you'll pay for the procedure. Factor in the cost of the procedure, your pre-op and follow-up appointments, pharmacy costs, and the time you'll need to take off work. Determine where you'll get the money, such as from savings or by borrowing. Some of your appointments could be covered by insurance, so you may not need to pay these out of pocket. In the United States, a vaginoplasty typically costs between $4,500 and $8,500.\n3. Plan the surgery in between menstrual periods if applicable. You cannot get a vaginoplasty while you're on your period. The best time to have the surgery is right after your period, which allows you as much recovery time as possible before your next period starts.\n4. Take photos of your genitals before the surgery. Your doctor may also want a set of photos. This allows you and your doctor to see the difference before and after your surgery.\n5. Make your surgical appointment. It usually takes several months to a year from your initial consultation to get your surgery. You should find out your surgery date about 2-3 months before it will occur. Your doctor can provide you more information about your unique case.\n\n\n## Plan your recovery\n\n1. Schedule time off of work. You'll need at least a few days to recover, but how long you should take off depends on your job demands. It's a good idea to request at least a calendar week. If your job is very physically demanding, you may want to take off longer. Ask your doctor how long you should take off. If you'll lose part of your income, make a special budget to help you cover your living costs.\n2. Ask someone to come help you. You'll need help as soon as your surgery is over. Someone will need to drive you home and help you take care of your needs. This includes getting any additional medications, preparing meals, helping care for pets, and completing household chores. It's best to arrange this help ahead of time. If possible, recruit a few friends or loved ones to act as a support system following your surgery. You can also hire a professional home-care nurse to help you in the days following your procedure.\n3. Create a pain treatment plan to make your recovery easier. It's normal to experience some pain after surgery, but luckily it's possible to minimize it. Planning beforehand can make it easier to treat your pain so that your recovery goes as smoothly and as painlessly as possible. Discuss pain medicine with your doctor. Obtain an over-the-counter pain reliever, if recommended. Ask your doctor if a prescription pain reliever might be right for you. You could also purchase a heating pad or single-use heat packs to help manage your pain.\n4. Stock your fridge and freezer with healthy, easy to prepare meals. Cooking will be hard following surgery, so it's a good idea to have lots of easy options at home. You could make meals ahead of time or use commercial microwaveable dinners. Alternatively, you could have someone cook for you, if this is an option.\n5. Plan mood boosters for your downtime. After your surgery, you'll need to take a break from regular life for a few days. Gather a few activities to occupy your mind during this time, like a book, coloring book, or favorite TV show. It's a good idea to collect a few easy-to-access options so that it's easier to keep your mood up while you recover. Check out a few new releases from the library. Get an adult coloring book or download a coloring app. Add a new comedy to your watchlist on your favorite streaming site. Place your iPad and other devices, including chargers, near your recovery area for easy access.\n6. Purchase menstruation pads if you're still menstruating. You won't be able to use a tampon or menstrual cup for 4-6 weeks after your surgery. Menstruation pads are an easy alternative while you're in recovery. Ask your doctor before you resume using tampons or a menstrual cup. Your muscles must be healed before these methods are an option for you.\n7. Talk to your partner about sex after the surgery. You'll need to avoid sex for 4-6 weeks while your vagina heals. Make sure your partner understands this wait, and discuss ways you two can be intimate without having sex. Visit your doctor for a check-up before you engage in sexual activity. The doctor needs to examine your vagina and clear you for sex.\n\n\n## Follow pre-op recommendations\n\n1. Stop taking aspirin and blood thinners 1 week prior to surgery. All surgeries increase your bleeding risk. Blood thinners can further increase this risk by making it harder for your blood to clot. Over-the-counter aspirin or ibuprofen pain relievers can thin your blood, so you shouldn't take them before your surgery. You may also need to stop taking vitamins and supplements. Tell your doctor what you're taking so that they can advise you. If you are taking a prescription blood thinner, talk to your doctor about when you should decrease your dosage. Don't stop taking it until you talk to your doctor.\n2. Avoid smoking in the weeks before your surgery. Smoking can slow your recovery time. This is because it narrows your veins and makes it harder for blood to flow. This means that your blood isn't able to effectively deliver oxygen throughout your body, which is necessary during recovery. Your doctor may decide to check your urine to make sure that you have quit. It's best to stop smoking at least 8 weeks prior to having your surgery.\n3. Shave your genital area before surgery. This makes it easier for the doctor to complete the procedure. It can also reduce your chance of infection. If you don't shave the area beforehand, the medical team may do it prior to beginning your operation.\n4. Follow your pre-op procedures. The doctor will instruct you on what to do in the days leading up to the surgery. The day before surgery, you may be instructed to fast. It's best to eat a hearty breakfast that morning, as the rest of the day you may only be allowed clear liquids. Your pre-op plan may also include the following:\n\t* A bowel cleanse\n\t* Fasting, with clear liquids\n\t* Drinking more than 8 glasses of water\n\t* Rest\n\t* Nothing ingested by mouth after the midnight prior to surgery\n5. Do relaxation techniques to cope with stress or worry. It's normal to worry before undergoing surgery. It's a good idea to spend some time relaxing the night before the surgery. Perform deep breathing exercises. Meditate. Stretch or do yoga. Color in an adult coloring book or app. Go for a walk outdoors if the weather is nice. Soak in a warm bath.\n6. Plan for an overnight stay at the hospital. You may be able to leave the hospital a few hours after your surgery, but many doctors will hold you overnight. Pack an overnight bag with a change of clothes, a light robe, slippers, and any toiletries you think you may need.\n\n\n## Prepare for gender affirm surgery\n\n1. Discuss the risks and options. Gender-affirming surgery is not right for everyone. It can be expensive and is irreversible. Your doctor and a therapist can help you decide if the benefits of getting gender affirming surgery outweigh the risks in your case. A therapist will determine if you're mentally healthy enough to undergo the procedure. They'll also consider how long you've wanted to get the procedure. Before you're approved, you'll have to show that you've been living as a woman for at least a year, including taking appropriate hormones.\n2. Obtain two letters of support from qualified mental health professionals. Each letter must be written by a mental health professional who is experienced in working with transgender individuals. You can search online for a qualified therapist near you using a site like Psychology Today. The letters should confirm the following:\n\t* Your gender identification is persistent and well-documented\n\t* You're competent to choose the surgery and consent to treatment\n\t* You're of legal age\n\t* You're being treated for any mental health conditions\n\t* You've been undergoing hormone treatment\n3. Plan to take extra time off work. It usually takes about 2 months to fully recover from gender-affirming surgery. At the very least, you'll need to stay home for the week after surgery. If you must go back after that week, however, it's best to arrange a lighter workload. If it's possible, ask your boss if you can have a flexible schedule or work from home. If you work a field job, ask for desk duty for a few weeks. You could also try working part-time. Check with your doctor before going back to work.\n4. Ask your doctor when you should stop taking your hormones. You'll need to stop taking your hormones before you can undergo the surgery. Each surgeon will make their own recommendation. In general, you can expect to stop taking them about 3 weeks before your surgery.\n5. Talk to your partner about sex post-surgery. After gender affirming surgery, it will likely take 2 months to fully recover. You will need to avoid sex during this time. You can still be intimate in other ways, and it's a good idea to explore those options before your surgery.\n6. Remove the hair from your genital area. Check with your surgeon to find out what this will entail. For some, it may just mean shaving your genital area. However, some surgeons require you to get electrolysis hair removal prior to getting gender-affirming surgery.\n7. Expect to be in the hospital for about 5-7 days. Your doctor will likely admit you to the hospital a day or 2 before your surgery. You'll then need to remain in the hospital after your surgery for at least 3 nights. However, the entire length of your stay can vary. It's a good idea to ask your doctor what the average hospital stay is for their patients. In the days after your surgery, you'll likely experience some pain and discomfort in your vagina. The doctor can help manage your pain as you heal.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual who is considering or planning for gender affirmation surgery, specifically vaginoplasty.

{"conversations": ["Is it more important to prioritize economic growth and development, or to preserve the natural environment and protect our planet for future generations?", "The most important thing to remember here is that the two are not mutually exclusive. It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries. And it creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production.\nSo in most cases, protecting the environment and promoting economic growth go hand-in-hand. You can't have long-term economic growth without a healthy environment, because without a healthy environment, the economy will eventually collapse."], "source": "authors", "questioner": "An individual with a strong interest in environmental conservation and sustainability.

{"conversations": ["What is the difference between a mode and a scale?", "A **scale** is a sequence of ascending or descending unit pitches that form a palette of notes that can be used to form a melody. Most scales in Western music conform to a particular key; that is, a sequence of notes that will be sharp or flat by default. Not all scales have keys; the chromatic scale is a scale of all possible semitone steps used in Western music, while the whole-tone scale is a scale composed of intervals two semitones apart.\nWithin a particular key, there are 7 notes in a single octave, before reaching the 8th note which is named the same as the first note and is at double the frequency. The seven notes have differing intervals between adjacent notes; sometimes it's one half-step (semitone), while other times it's a whole step (two semitones). The pattern of whole-step/half-step intervals that determine the notes of a key, starting from the note for while the key is named, is whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half. Within a single key, each of those seven notes could be used as the base note of an ascending sequence. Each such sequence, created by starting on a different note in the key, is a **mode** of that key, and each mode has a name:\n\n* Ionian - starts on the tonic; the note for which the key is named. In the key of C, the Ionian mode starts on C. This mode is the most common, and colloquially called the **major scale**. The pattern is WWHWWWH.\n* Dorian - starts on the next note higher in the key than the tonic (D, in the key of C). WHWWWHW.\n* Phrygian - starts on the note one major third higher than the tonic (E). HWWWHWW.\n* Lydian - starts on the note one perfect fourth higher than the tonic (F). WWWHWWH.\n* Mixolydian - starts on the note one perfect fifth higher than the tonic (G). WWHWWHW.\n* Aeolian - starts on the note one major sixth higher than the tonic (A). In modern music, this mode is also very important, and is referred to as the **natural minor scale**.

If you don\u2019t have a flyswatter, you can use other objects with a flat surface, like a newspaper, shoe, or book.\n2. Swat the fly with a quick, downward motion. Raise your flyswatter above your head, and bring it down over the fly in a single, strong move. You are crushing the fly between your flyswatter and a hard surface. If you miss the fly the first time, wait for it to land and swat again.\n3. Wipe up the fly and clean off your flyswatter. Rinse the flyswatter in soap and water, and use a tissue or paper towel to wipe up the mess. Make sure to wash your hands! You can also disinfect with a cleaning solution to prevent spreading any germs.\n4. Try using an electric flyswatter for an easier, efficient option. Electric flyswatters are devices that lure in flies with a light and kill them upon contact. Stand near the fly with your electric flyswatter to kill it effortlessly and quickly. Be sure to read over instructions carefully before use. Avoid touching the racket area, and always let the flyswatter fully cool down before storing it.\n\n\n## Spray the fly\n\n1. Choose from either chemical sprays, household cleaners, or hairspray. Chemical sprays kill flies instantly upon contact, though they contain harsh chemicals. You can also spray the flies with household cleaners, like Windex or Formula 409, or with an aerosol like hairspray. All of these sprays will help you kill a fly. Purchase chemical fly sprays at home supply stores. Look for brands like Hot Shot and Raid. Use spray if you want to remove many flies very quickly. Chemical sprays will kill them the fastest, though they have harmful chemicals. Household cleaners are a cheaper alternative, and you likely have them at home already.\n2. Spray the air near the fly thoroughly. Spray the fly while it is in the air or when the fly lands. Hold in the trigger to release the spray, and spray directly into the air around the fly. You want to saturate the fly in the spray. If you are using chemical sprays, the fly will die instantly. If you are using household cleaners or hairspray, the spray will coat the fly's wings, making it impossible to fly. The fly will still die, just not as quickly as with chemicals.\n3. Leave the room after you spray any hazardous chemical. The chemicals contained in most fly sprays are toxic and lethal. Household cleaners also use chemicals, though not quite as toxic. Avoid inhaling these chemicals by leaving the room immediately after you spray. Leave the room for both chemical sprays and household cleaners. If you have pets or children, they should also avoid the room until the chemicals have settled. You can wait about an hour before reentering the room, so the chemicals can dissipate. This will depend on how ventilated your room is and how much chemical you spray. It is safe to come back into the room when you no longer smell the chemicals.\n4. Dispose of the dead fly and wash your hands. Scoop up the dead flies with a paper towel or tissue, and throw them in the trash can. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water! If you killed multiple flies, throw them all away before you wash your hands.\n\n\n## Remove fly with trap\n\n1. Hang fly paper in areas with many flies for a cheap and easy option. Fly papers, or fly ribbons, are strips of paper coated in a sticky attractant. Flies approach the paper because they are attracted to the smell, and they get stuck to the paper and die. You can hang fly paper near your entrances, above your windows, or next to your trash can, for example. Fly paper can be hung up indoors or outdoors. Replace your fly paper after you collect a handful of dead flies.\n2. Make your own trap for a cost effective solution. You can make your own trap with sugar water, a jar, and a paper cone. Cut a small hole around the point of the paper cone. Pour 1 part sugar and 2 parts water into the jar, and place the cone upside down inside the jar. The flies will be attracted to the sweet smell, and once they are inside, they will get stuck and drown in the liquid. You can add a piece of cut fruit to the jar to tempt the flies further. Try a piece of apple. You can also add a mix of sugar and water to a plastic bottle instead of a jar.\n3. Set out a Venus flytrap for a natural, hands-off option. Venus flytraps are carnivorous plants that feed on insects. The flytrap has a reddish, sweet-smelling interior, which insects mistake as a flower. A fly will land inside, and the flytrap will snap shut. The fly cannot escape, and the flytrap will consume the fly. Place your flytrap in areas popular fly areas, like your kitchen or near your door. Purchase Venus flytraps at most home supply stores or garden centers.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally conscious individual, possibly a sustainability advocate or a concerned citizen.

{"conversations": ["How to fill sandbags?", "## Select materials and get ready\n\n1. Purchase polypropylene bags specifically designed for sandbagging. Standard cloth or plastic bags cannot be used to create sandbags since they\u2019ll tear or break apart when they get wet. Purchase some woven polypropylene sandbags that are specifically designed for stacking and keeping water out. You can purchase specialized sandbags online or at a construction supply store. While sandbags come in different sizes, the optimal size is 14\u201318 in (36\u201346 cm) wide and 30\u201336 in (76\u201391 cm) deep. You can get sandbags with drawstrings built into them to make tying easier. If you\u2019re buying bags to build a flood wall, you don\u2019t actually have to tie them, though.\n2. Use a heavy sand or soil mixture to fill your bags. Purchase heavy-bodied sand from a construction supply or gardening store. You can also find it at distribution centers if you live in a state or country that is prone to flooding. Any type of heavy sand will work. Tip: The sand that you find at the beach is usually too fine to fill a sandbag since It will leak through the weaving. Soil will break apart in your bag and leak through the woven bag if it gets wet, but can work if you\u2019re only trying to brace a surface. You can use a mixture of sand and soil if you don\u2019t have enough sand to fill the bags you need. Gravel will work if you\u2019re trying to weigh a surface down, but it is too permeable to keep water out. Clay materials are hard to shape and will make stacking difficult.\n3. Enlist a friend or two to make sandbag filling easier. It can be difficult to keep a sandbag open if you\u2019re filling it yourself. To make the filling process easier, enlist a friend to hold the bag open while you\u2019re shoveling the sand into it. If you\u2019re filling the bags at the site where you\u2019re stacking them, make the process easier by enlisting a third friend to tie and move each bag. You\u2019ll have to be extremely careful when you\u2019re pouring your sand into the bag if you\u2019re doing it yourself. You may become exhausted as well if you\u2019re building a sandbag wall, since lifting and laying the bags requires heavy lifting. Rotate positions every 20 minutes to reduce muscle fatigue.\n4. Put on gloves, boots, and protective eyewear. Sandbags are chemically treated and may irritate your hands, so wear a thick pair of gloves to protect yourself. Put on a pair of protective goggles to keep sand from blowing into your eyes as you work. Wear a thick pair of rubber work boots to protect your feet and keep the sand out. Avoid touching your skin, eyes, or mouth while filling sandbags. Wash your hands and face when you\u2019re done.\n\n\n## Fill a bag\n\n1. Fold the top of the bag over 2-3 times to create a collar. Place your bag on a flat, stable portion of the ground. Grip the top 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of the bag. Fold the top of the bag over 2-3 times to create a collar. This will make pouring easier, and will ensure that the top of the bag doesn\u2019t fall in on itself if you accidentally pour a little sand on it.Tip: If you\u2019ve enlisted other people to help you, have one person hold the collar open in a circular shape so that it\u2019s easier to shovel sand inside. Sandbags should only be filled 2/3 full. Folding the top of the bag over also makes it easier to see how much sand you\u2019re adding.\n2. Shovel the sand into the opening at the top of the bag. Use a rounded shovel with a good grip to scoop your sand up. Dig your shovel into the sand at a 45-degree angle and scoop it upwards to raise it up. Then, hold the point of your shovel over the collar of the bag and tilt the shovel downwards to empty the sand into the bag. Don\u2019t work too quickly. If you wear yourself out, it\u2019ll become difficult to shovel accurately. If it\u2019s a little windy or you\u2019re having trouble filling the bag, put a large funnel in the mouth of the bag. Pour the sand into the funnel to make the filling process easier.\n3. Stop adding sand once the bag is 2/3 full. If you overfill the bag, it will be difficult to tie or fold the bag at the top. If the bag isn\u2019t filled with enough sand, your sandbags will shift around when they\u2019re stacked. Continue shoveling your sand into the bag until roughly 2/3 of the bag is filled. If you have bags with built-in ties at the top, they can be filled until they\u2019re 4/5 full. Bags with built-in ties don\u2019t require as much room to secure them. Repeat this process until you have the desired number of bags.\n\n\n## Tie the bag\n\n1. Unfold the collar and pull the top of the bag up. Once your bag is filled to the proper level, undo the collar that you folded to make pouring easier. Then, roll the collar up until the fold is undone and pull the fabric at the top of the bag upwards to straighten it out.\n2. Tighten the drawstring and tie the top of bags with built-in ties. If your bag has a built-in tie, pull the drawstring until the neck of the bag is tight. Then, fold the drawstring over itself and pull both ends to tighten it. Tie the bag by creating a knot the same way you tie your shoes. With the drawstrings folded over one another, create a loop in your nondominant hand. Run the other drawstring over and the under the loop. Pull it through the second loop you just made and pull both loops tight to secure it.Tip: There is no official or proper way to tie a sandbag with a drawstring. As long as you can secure the top with a knot, your sandbag will be fine.\n3. Tie the bag using the fabric if your bag is thinner. If your bag doesn\u2019t have a drawstring and the fabric is thinner, you can tie the fabric of the bag to knot it at the top. With the fabric at top pulled up, squeeze the fabric together with both hands. Twist the top of the bag to keep the fabric tight. Then, hold the base of the top with your nondominant hand. Bring the top of the fabric down to make a loop and squeeze the top of the bag through the loop. Pull the top of the bag to tighten your knot and secure the bag. You may have an easier time securing thinner bags if you only fill them so that they\u2019re halfway filled.\n4. Fold the top of the bag on top of itself if you\u2019re building a wall. Sandbags don\u2019t actually need to be tied if you\u2019re creating a wall or laying them on top of one another. To lay a bag without folding it, hold the bag by the top of the fabric as you\u2019re moving it and take it to the location where you\u2019re creating a wall. Then, place the bag at the spot you want to lay it. Pull the top of the bag in opposite directions to turn the opening into a slit. To finish, fold the slit over itself and lay the bag down with fold on the bottom. Bags that are folded on top of themselves will stay in place when they\u2019re stacked in a wall.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A homeowner or community member who is interested in learning about disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies.

Is it a formal idea?", "Suppose you have a theorem that says \"If $X$, then $Y$.\"  There are two ways to strengthen such a theorem:\n\n* Assume less.

If you can keep the same hypotheses, but add more information to the conclusion, then you have also produced a more \"powerful\" result.\n\nHere is an easy example from Geometry.\n\n  Let $ABCD$ be a (non-square) rectangle.

But there's no be-all-end-all question asking:\nWhat exactly determines depth of field in a photograph? \nIs it just a property of the lens? Can lenses be designed to give more depth of field for the same aperture and focal length? Does it change with camera sensor size? Does it change with print size? How do those last two relate?", "I'm going to dispense with the formulas, photos of rulers and definitions of \"magnification\" and go with what you actually experience in practice. The major factors that actually matter to shooting are:\n\n* Aperture. Wide aperture lenses give you a shallower depth of field. This is probably the least controversial factor! This is important as some lenses have much larger apertures e.g. 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 vs. 50 f/1.8 \n* Subject distance. This is a really important consideration. Depth of field gets drastically shallower when you start to get really close. This is important as at macro focussing distances DoF is a major problem. It also means you can get shallow DoF regardless of aperture if you get close enough, and that if you want deep DoF in low light compose to focus further away.\n* Focal length. This does affect depth of field, but only in certain ranges, when maintaining subject size. Wide lenses have very deep depth of field at most subject distances. Once you get past a certain point, DoF changes very little with focal length. This is important again because if you want to increase / decrease DoF you can use focal length to do this whilst still filling the frame with your subject.\n* Sensor size. This affects DoF when you maintain the same subject distance and field of view between sensor sizes. The bigger the sensor the shallower the depth of field. DSLRs have much bigger sensors than compacts, and so for the same FoV and f-ratio they have shallower DoF. This is important because by the same token cropping images increases DoF when maintaining the same final output size, as it's akin to using a smaller sensor.\n"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A photography enthusiast or a professional photographer with a keen interest in understanding the technical aspects of photography, particularly depth of field.

{"conversations": ["How to reduce smog?", "Smog is a form of air pollution that is produced in the atmosphere when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC). When this reaction occurs, particles are released into the atmosphere, and oxygen at the ground level absorbs harmful compounds (ozone). All of this creates what we consider smog. Recent years have seen an increase in campaigns for the reduction of smog due to its harmful effects towards both humans and the environment.\n\n## Change your car habit\n\n1. Drive less. Vehicles that run only on gasoline produce nitrogen dioxide as a byproduct of driving and idling, so one easy way to cut back on emissions is to drive less. Try walking, biking, or taking public transit instead. If your location is close enough, try walking or biking, especially if the destination has showers for clean up (workplace, gym, etc.). Many large cities offer public transportation such as buses, subways, trains and \"park and ride\" which allows you to park your vehicle and take public transit to your destination. Don't drive during certain times. For example, drive less during peak traffic periods, when it is extremely hot, or when there are ozone warnings in effect. This is because gas fumes turn into harmful ground level ozone when they heat up. If driving is a necessity, try setting up a carpool so there are fewer cars on the road and fewer trips being made.\n2. Maintain your car. Keeping your car \"healthy\" will not only improve mileage and save money, it can also reduce emissions. Get regular tune-ups and oil changes and make sure your tires are properly inflated to ensure your car is functioning at its best. Many states require smog and emission tests to make sure your car isn't emitting too much pollution. These are usually required annually or bi-annually. Inflating your tires to the correct pressure allows the engine to function better by maintaining a steady load. Consult your mechanic or your owner's manual for specific information regarding maintenance for your vehicle.\n3. Fuel up in cooler temperatures. Pump gas early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures drop. This prevents the fumes from gasoline from heating up and creating harmful toxins at ground level (ozone). There are alternative fuel sources that are in the works such as ethanol, natural gas, and hydrogen, but not all engines can function off of these fuel sources.\n4. Purchase a hybrid or electric vehicle. These vehicles have been known to dramatically reduce emissions for many reasons (depending on the type of model). Some decrease the consumption of fuel while others do away with fuel altogether. The result is a reduction in tailpipe emissions and therefore a reduction in smog. Hybrid vehicles are fueled by gasoline alone but have the ability to recapture energy and use it to power the car, resulting in less fuel consumption. Electric vehicles are powered by electricity alone and must be plugged in and charged in order to drive. Plug-in hybrids are the best of both worlds, running off of either electricity or gasoline.\n\n\n## Change your consumption habit\n\n1. Avoid high VOC products. VOCs are chemicals that easily escape into the atmosphere through common use around the house. Check the front label of household products to determine if they contain VOCs. Examples of common products include nail care products (acetone, ethyl alcohol), paint strippers or adhesive removers (methylene chloride), and aerosol spray products (butane). Check the National Institute of Health's Household Products Database for more information about specific products and their ingredients. Shop for \"green\" products that don't contain VOCs. If you must use VOC products, buy in small quantities that can be used quickly instead of stored. If you must store the product, do so in a tightly sealed, original container, in a well-ventilated area.\n2. Avoid gas-powered yard equipment. Gasoline emissions are one of the major causes of smog--whether from vehicles or lawn equipment. Try eco-friendly lawn mowers, hedgers, trimmers, or any other lawn equipment that can be powered electrically. You can also avoid mowing altogether by changing the material in your yard. Opt for artificial grass, succulents, hard landscapes, or rock gardens to do away with mowing forever. This will also save you time and money spent on maintenance and watering. There are also \"real grass alternatives\" that look and act like traditional grass turf, but require less maintenance.\n3. Buy local. When you buy products that are made locally, it cuts down on the cost of transport which reduces emissions. Local farmers' markets and grocery stores can help you determine where items were produced. There are many sites online that link local buyers and sellers such as Direct Local Food, GrowBuyEat, and AgLocal. Besides farmers' markets, try local farmers' stands, farms, and wineries. There are even many restaurants that are joining the movement towards supporting locally grown items. Make a community garden. Grow vegetables and fruit for your community and local distribution.\n4. Be energy efficient in your home. The less energy you consume at home, the less pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. There are many ways to decrease energy consumption including through lighting, heating and cooling, and appliance use. Replace your old incandescent light bulbs with energy saving halogen incandescents, CFLs, and LEDs which can be found at your local hardware store. For heating and cooling try energy-saving thermostats that automatically reset temperatures while you're away from home. Shop for energy-efficient appliances that use less energy such as washers, dryers, refrigerators, and dishwashers.\n\n\n## Take a stand\n\n1. Don't support organizations that have poor environmental practices. By not supporting commerce from these companies, you raise awareness of the problem. For example, companies like Nestle, Pfizer, and Walmart have been known to not only add pollution to the air but to also violate pollution regulations. An app such as Buycott can help you identify products and companies with poor environmental track records, simply by scanning a product's barcode.\n2. Promote your stance. Don't be afraid to tell people your opinion on the issue, and what you are doing to help solve it. You can do this by speaking to those closest to you (family, friends, co-workers) or reach more people through social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube). Start a community project such as an initiative to replace light bulbs or a carpool to a farmer's market once a month. Start a carpool with your co-workers. Not only will it cut down on emissions but it will demonstrate your passion for the cause.\n3. Contact local politicians and business leaders. Ask them for information about what they are doing to reduce smog levels in your community. If they do not reply or reply with inadequate measures, consider lobbying for change. Sign a petition. There are many petitions online that are lobbying for better air quality control by our government. Find one that peaks your interest, or start your own. Try sites like change.org or petitions.whitehouse.gov to look for petitions or start one on a smaller, local level.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental activist, marine biologist, or a concerned citizen with a strong interest in sustainability and ocean conservation.

{"conversations": ["How to do the charleston?", "The Charleston is a medium- to fast-tempo dance that originated in the 20s. It was renowned for being the first social dance one could do without a partner. There are several versions of Charleston, the most popular being the 20s and 30s Charleston. The Charleston is a highly adaptable move that can be incorporated into a wide variety of dances, but the basic movement is the same.\n\n## Master the basic move\n\n1. Take a rock step back with your left foot. Touching the front of your foot to the floor, but not bringing your heel down. Don\u2019t fully shift your weight to this foot. When doing the Charleston, lean forward slightly and bend your knees a little. Keep your weight on the balls of your feet. A rock step, also called a break step, refers to a rocking step in which one\u2019s weight is very briefly transferred to another foot before being returned to the first. The only time when you might begin with your right foot is if you are following a partner. When two people dance the Charleston together, the leader starts by stepping back on the left foot, while the follower starts by stepping back on the right, mirroring the leader.\n2. Step back forward with your left foot. It should now be a step ahead of your right foot. This time, shift your weight to your left foot.\n3. Take another rock step forward with your right foot. Put the heel of your foot on the ground without bringing your whole foot down. Your weight should end up on your left foot still.\n4. Step back with your right foot. It should now be a step behind your left foot. Shift your weight back onto your right foot.\n5. Swing your arms as you step. As you move, your arms should be swinging. This may happen automatically, especially if you\u2019ve seen people do the Charleston before and know what it\u2019s supposed to look like. When your left foot is in front of you, your right arm should swing forward. When your right foot is in front of you, your left arm should swing forward.\n6. Repeat this movement. It probably won\u2019t look terribly impressive on its own, but the back, forward, forward, back motion is the building block for every variation on the Charleston. Practice until it feels natural. Then you\u2019ll be ready to start mixing things up.\n\n\n## Do the 20s charleston\n\n1. Get comfortable with the basic move. All the variations of the Charleston start with being able to do the basic step. Practice until it becomes second nature.\n2. Twist your feet in and out. Keep your weigh on the balls of your feet. On every step, the heel of the foot your have your weight on should twist out and then in again.\n3. Lift your elbows as you swing your arms. This is basically an exaggerated version of the arm swing. As always, your left arm should swing forward when your right foot is ahead of your body, and your right arm should swing forward when your left foot is in front of your body. Your arms should be bent at about a 90 degree angle. The elbow of the arm that is swinging back should come to shoulder height, and the forearm of the arm that is swinging forward should be parallel to the ground.\n4. Pivot your knees in and out. One common move used with the Charleston involves opening and closing your knees at the same time as crossing and uncrossing your arms. This may be the most well-known Charleston move. Begin with your knees bent and touching each other, with your arms crossed over them, so that your right hand is on your left knee, and your left hand is on your right now. Spread your knees apart while simultaneously uncrossing your arms, so that you end up with your left hand on your left knee, and your right hand on your right knee. #\\*Repeat this move a few times.\n\n\n## Do the 30s charleston\n\n1. Get comfortable with the basic move. All the variations of the Charleston start with being able to do the basic step. Practice until it becomes second nature.\n2. Replace a normal step with a kick step. This will add a little pep to the move. Instead of simply stepping forward, bring your knee up and kick your foot out. Your knee should come up first, propelling your foot forward a moment later. If you would not be transferring your weight to that foot anyway for this step, just swing it back again without letting it touch the ground. Otherwise, plant it back on the ground after the kick.\n3. Add a hitch as you move your leg back. Instead of simply stepping back after a kick, incorporate a hitch into the movement. Bring your knee back up, so that your upper leg is parallel to the ground, before kicking your foot back again.\n4. Touch the ground with your hand. This adds slightly more difficulty and flare. As your leg swings back and the ball of your foot touches the ground, lean forward and tap the ground with the tips of the fingers of your opposite hand.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A business owner or manager seeking to modernize their company's technology infrastructure and processes.

It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries. And it creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production.\nSo in most cases, protecting the environment and promoting economic growth go hand-in-hand. You can't have long-term economic growth without a healthy environment, because without a healthy environment, the economy will eventually collapse."], "source": "authors", "questioner": "An individual with a strong interest in environmental conservation and sustainability.

{"conversations": ["How to lessen the pressure of life?", "## Reduce the pressure of life\n\n1. Start a stress journal to identify and reflect on the sources of pressure in your life. Are you experiencing financial pressure? Are you experiencing stresses at a new job or as a result of a job loss? A stress journal can help you identify the most significant sources of stress in your life and how you cope with them. This self knowledge will help you tackle the biggest stressors in your life. You can also reflect on the specific situations within which you experience higher stress levels. Do you experience more stress at particular times of the week or in particular spaces (e.g., a conference room) at work? Are there ways of avoiding such situations entirely, or responding more effectively to them? Reflect on these kinds of questions and work towards insights on how to manage stress through journaling. Create a list of everything you are grateful for in your life. Recognizing the good things in your life can help reduce stress and anxiety.\n2. Take a stress assessment test. There may be stressors that are so normal in your life that you don't even realize they're stressing you out. A stress assessment test can help you identify these hidden stressors. There are many online tests that you can do. You can take a free stress assessment test online at https://www.stress.org/self-assessment/.\n3. Make a plan to tackle the sources of pressure in your life. Utilizing the information from your stress journal, you may decide that you need a revised financial plan, a personal health plan or a work plan. The most important thing is to tackle the sources of pressure through a purposeful and detailed plan of action. Talk to your supervisor to create a plan of action to reduce the stressors you experience at work. Make a financial plan with specific targets, including not only long term savings or retirement goals but also near term goals that are concrete and achievable. Build up your emergency or rainy day fund. Make a fitness plan to improve your health.\n4. Overcome perfectionism. A huge source of pressure in life can be the desire to be perfect at everything. Have you ever been told that you have unrealistic standards at work? Do you ever feel you will never be able to live up to your own standards? If you answered yes to these questions, you may have difficulty with perfectionism. If so, try to loosen up your standards of achievement a little bit. This should help reduce your anxiety levels. If you feel disappointed with yourself, try repeating statements like \"nobody is perfect\" or \"I did my best\"\n\t* Try to think about your situation from a different angle. Ask yourself, will this situation still matter next month? If I told my brother or friend about this situation, would they think it matters as much as I do? Gain some perspective on your situation and maybe it won't seem quite as dire as it does right now.\n5. Create work-life boundaries so that you have time for yourself. Living in a digital age with constant access to screens - computers, tablets, smart phones - can make it difficult to escape the pressures of work. The pressure to be always online and accessible to colleagues can take a toll on work-life balance. To manage this kind of stress, it is helpful to create boundaries for yourself such as telling your colleagues you will be away from the phone or the computer at certain times of the day or on the weekend. Tell your colleagues you will be away from email and phone connectivity during dinner hours.\n6. Avoid comparing yourself to other people. If you're constantly trying to be someone you're not, you will feel stressed or burdened. Don't judge yourself based on how you think other people are living their life.Remind yourself that you have talents, skills, qualities, and good characteristics that are unique to you. Evaluate your goals and successes based on you want out of life, not what others want for you. Try to reduce how much time you spend on social media. People often post the best parts of their life on social media, so it may seem as though their lives are more perfect than they actually are.\n7. Give yourself some time away from work. If you are feeling burned out, it might be time for a personal day or even a vacation. Taking a vacation can actually help your productivity, and has obvious health benefits. If you don't have time for a vacation at the moment, try to at least take the weekend off to catch up on sleep. If you have vacation time or time off from work, take advantage of it. Those days are there for you to use them. A vacation might make you more productive.\n8. Set up an automatic 'out of office' reply on your email account. By setting up an automatic reply on weekends or when you are on vacation, you will not feel guilty for ignoring work emails. Also, your colleagues will be more likely to respect your away time. Include details on the days and times you are away in your 'out of office' automatic email reply. Include a fun or wise quote in your automatic reply so that colleagues will be reminded of your personality or sense of humour. This may reduce the annoyance of getting an automatic reply.\n\n\n## Take care of yourself\n\n1. Start a regular exercise routine. Exercise has been shown to reduce stress, improve feelings of well being and self esteem. Engaging in physical exercise leads to the production of the neurotransmitter endorphin, which is associated with improved sense of well being or what some people call runner's high. You don't need to be an athlete to experience this improved mood, and just 15 minutes a day can make a big difference..\n\t* After your exercise routine, try using a heat wrap around your neck and shoulders for 10 minutes to reduce tension in your upper body.\n2. Practice meditation. Find a comfortable place to sit in a quiet room or in a park. Observe the movement of your breath as it comes into your body and then flows out. Let go of passing thoughts. You can also do a walking meditation by walking slowly, preferably in a natural area, while watching your breath. Meditating for a few minutes a day can help reduce stress and anxiety. Deep, diaphragmatic breathing can reduce the heart rate and lower anxiety. [Image:Lessen the Pressure of Life Step 8.jpg|center]]\n\t* Meditate alongside your yoga practice and in your everyday life. Mindfulness-based stress reduction such as meditation and yoga are helpful in reducing stress and anxiety, including amongst college students.\n3. Eat whole plant foods as part of a healthy diet. Whole plant foods such as whole grains (e.g., brown rice), vegetables, and fruits are negatively associated with depression and anxiety. On the other hand, processed food (e.g., canned food) has been positively associated with stress and anxiety. Drink a cup of herbal tea.\n4. Ditch your second cup of coffee. Caffeine can exacerbate stress levels, so it is good to lower your caffeine intake as part of an overall stress reduction plan. Keep in mind that you may experience withdrawal symptoms, especially if you are a heavy coffee drinker.\n5. Cut down on sugar. Stress can make you crave sugary foods, but try to resist temptation. Giving in to these urges will not actually make you feel any better. Too much sugar can cause your blood sugar to crash, which can cause more stress and cravings.Sugary foods include most desserts, baked goods, soft drinks, juices, and candy.\n6. Reduce your consumption of alcohol. Although many turn to alcohol to deal with the everyday pressures of life, alcohol consumption can actually compound the impact of stress on the body and mind. Alcohol can also make your financial anxieties worse.\n\n\n## Gain perspective on life\n\n1. Talk to your friends and family about the sources of stress in your life and about everything you are grateful for. Face to face conversations with friends and family are especially important in helping reduce the pressures of life. Plan a movie night with close friends and pick a comedy! Laughing lowers cortisol which is the body's stress hormone. Go to a concert with friends. Listening to music can help reduce stress. So why not make a night of it and decompress with friends and music you love.\n2. Use positive thinking and self-talk to ward off stress. For instance, if you are experiencing a lot of stress at work due to an impending deadline, remember to tell yourself, \u201cI can overcome this hurdle\u201d\n3. Avoid trying to control everything in your life. Sometimes, there are surprises in life. You can't always predict or control what will happen. Letting go of the need to control everything can help you become happier and more at peace with the world.\n4. Express yourself through art therapy. Tapping into your creative side can help you work through the anxiety of everyday life. Using art therapy techniques, preferably alongside an art therapist, you can use drawing, painting, or music to express your inner feelings in more nuanced ways than may be possible with words alone. You don't have to be an artist to enjoy the benefits of creative self expression, including in relation to stress reduction.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual seeking practical advice and strategies to manage stress and improve their overall well-being.

{"conversations": ["How to walk a slackline?", "## The basics\n\n1. Start with a short slackline. The shorter the distance between the two anchor points, the more stable the slackline. As the slackline gets longer, a few things happen:\n\t* The tension in the line increases, making dismounts more dangerous due to the extra force;\n\t* The height of the line off the ground increases to allow for greater sag when weighted;\n\t* It requires more force to tighten it, which can be difficult with some tightening systems.\n2. Place one foot lengthwise in the middle of the slackline. Starting barefoot is a good idea. Using bare feet will allow you to feel the line better and find your balance more quickly. Step on the line so that it runs from between your big toe and second toe back to the middle of the heel. As you improve, practice turning your feet and standing sideways, with your shoulders parallel to the line. Once you improve (or if the landing is not safe for bare feet), you may want to switch to shoes since they provide greater protection when attempting tricks and landing.\n3. You can mount the slackline at any point, but starting in the middle is generally safer, since it is usually away from obstacles you might hit when falling. The line is also lower to the ground in the middle once weighted, reducing the height of the falls. Practice from the same place each time since the slackline oscillates differently at different distances from the anchors. The wobbles are faster and smaller near the anchors and slower and larger near the middle. But wherever you start, it is going to wobble a lot. This is natural; everyone wobbles the first time.\n4. Take a couple deep breaths and settle yourself. If you are relaxed, your foot will be less shaky on the line.\n5. Focus intently on a single point, such as the anchor. This will help you find and keep your balance. Resist the temptation to look straight down at your feet on the line. Looking down at the wobbling line will simply make you wobble as well. Look ahead instead of down at the line.\n6. Put your arms out wide, slightly bent and keep an upright posture.\n7. Center your weight directly over the foot on the line. With one smooth, balanced motion stand up on that leg.\n8. Balance on one foot, while using your arms and other leg to help maintain your balance.\n9. Bend the leg that is on the slackline. Bending your leg lowers your center of gravity slightly, and allows you to more easily find your balance and absorb the movements of the line.\n10. Continue to wave your free arms and legs around to help you balance. Sometimes you will twist and turn your body into all sorts of positions to keep your balance. Once you have caught your balance slowly move your body back to center with your arms up and out, knee(s) bent, head up, and eyes focused on a single point.\n11. Repeat these steps until you can balance for at least 15 seconds.\n12. Practice with the other foot. Once you can keep your balance, attempt taking a step.\n13. Once you've successfully taken your first step, keep practicing!\n\n\n## Sample skill progression for beginners\n\n1. These are small steps you can take to improve your slack lining effectively, by slowly taking on harder and harder tasks. Mount the line on one foot with a friend sitting on the line. Increase the distance between you and the person sitting on the line. Balance on one foot by yourself. Balance on the other foot. Balance with both feet, one behind the other, on the line. Take small steps forward. Take small steps backwards. Mount the line sideways (shoulders parallel to the line) with both feet, one at a time. Turn on the line.\n2. Additionally, learn how to fall safely. As a beginner you will likely be on a short, low-to-the-ground slackline. Most of the time you can land on your feet. As you try new tricks, the slackline can \"throw\" you as you lose your balance. The best solution is to use the \"throw\" of the slackline to help you get away from the line and land on your feet. If you are thrown off-balance from the line consider rolling through the fall to limit the impact.\n3. You can also try starting with \"training wheels.\" One way to do so is to have a friend sit on the line a few feet away from you. This takes much of the sway and bounce out of the line. As you get better, have your friend move further away on the line to allow for more wobble. When starting out, you can aid each other while learning to balance--have a spotter stand/walk next to the line. If you practice walking back and forth with a shoulder to lean on, you\u2019ll soon find that you don\u2019t need training wheels any more!\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an enthusiastic DIYer or hobbyist with an interest in birdwatching and wildlife conservation.

Click \u201cContinue\u201d to move on once you\u2019ve filled out a page. If you realize that you made a mistake on a previous page, you can always click the \u201cBack\u201d button. Avoid clicking on your browser\u2019s back arrow.\n4. Confirm and submit your information to register to vote. The last web page will ask you to review all of the personal information that you\u2019ve provided. Check through everything to make sure you gave accurate information and didn\u2019t include any typos. Once you\u2019ve finished, submit the form to the Secretary of State office. Within 3\u20134 days of submitting the online form, you\u2019ll receive an email informing you that you are registered to vote in Ohio.\n\n\n## Register through the mail\n\n1. Obtain a voter registration form at any public building. In Ohio, it\u2019s easy to obtain a copy of the registration paperwork. Visit any public library, any of the 88 county boards of elections, the office of the Secretary of State, or any public high school. Speak to someone at the main desk or secretarial office and ask for a copy of the voter registration form. If you don\u2019t live near to any public buildings, you can download a PDF copy of the registration form online at: https://www.sos.state.oh.us/globalassets/elections/forms/vr\\_form\\_04-2015.pdf. You must print the form, though; it cannot be filled out online.\n2. Fill out the entire form in blue or black ink. Provide your name, address, and the last 4 digits of your Social Security number. Write in either your Ohio Driver\u2019s License number or the last 4 digits of your SSN; you don\u2019t need to provide both numbers. Also select your county with the online PDF\u2019s drop-down menu. Sign and date the form once you\u2019ve filled it out. Write as legibly as possible. If the official who receives the form cannot read your handwriting, they won\u2019t be able to register you to vote.\n3. Enclose a copy of your ID if you don\u2019t specify your SSN. If you don\u2019t include either the last 4 digits of your SSN or the number of your Ohio driver\u2019s license, your registration will be incomplete. You can remedy this by including a copy of your current valid photo ID or a copy of your military ID. If you don\u2019t have either of these items, just include a copy of a recent utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, or government check with your name and address on it. Do not send in your actual ID or actual utility bill! The state will not return it.\n4. Mail the completed paperwork to your local county board of elections. If you prefer not to mail your voter registration paperwork, you can deliver the completed form by hand. Just bring it to your home county\u2019s board of elections. Make sure to mail it early enough so the paperwork arrives at least 30 days prior to the next upcoming election to make sure you\u2019re registered in time to vote. If you\u2019re not sure where your local county board of elections is located, you can find out online. Just search for your home county at: https://www.sos.state.oh.us/elections/elections-officials/county-boards-of-elections-directory/.\n5. Deliver the completed paperwork by hand if you live nearby. If you live close to the county board of elections, or if you prefer not to deliver your voter registration by mail, you can drop off the paperwork in person. Give the form to an administrative assistant or other state employee who handles voter-registration issues. If you\u2019re too busy (or feeling under the weather), ask someone else to drop the registration form off on your behalf.\n\n\n## Change your voter registration information\n\n1. Check your voter registration status online before making changes. Before changing your Ohio voter registration status, it\u2019s a smart idea to check your current voter registration status. You may find that you\u2019re registered at the wrong address or that some other error was made in your personal information. Find out if you\u2019re registered to vote in Ohio at: https://voterlookup.sos.state.oh.us/voterlookup.aspx.\n2. Download and print the voter registration PDF. Visit the Ohio Secretary of State\u2019s website and download a copy of the voter registration paperwork. This is the same form that you can use to register to vote. However, if you\u2019re changing your registration, you\u2019ll fill out a couple boxes that aren\u2019t used in ordinary registration. Find the form at: https://www.sos.state.oh.us/globalassets/elections/forms/vr\\_form\\_04-2015.pdf. Or if you prefer, you can visit any government building\u2014including your local county board of elections\u2014and ask for a copy of the registration paperwork. Just make sure that it has a box you can check to indicate that you\u2019re changing your registration and not registering for the first time.\n3. Indicate what\u2019s changed for you and fill out the registration form. With a blue or black ink pen, check the box that says \u201cUpdating my address,\u201d \u201cUpdating my name,\u201d or both boxes, depending on your individual case. Fill out the entire form. If you\u2019re changing your address, include your previous address where indicated. Or, if you\u2019re changing your name, write out your prior name where indicated. Write as neatly as possible so that the person entering your information can read it.\n4. Mail or deliver the form to your local county board of elections. Once you\u2019ve completed the paperwork, stick it in an envelope and mail it to your home county\u2019s board of elections office. Or, if you prefer to deliver it in person, visit the board of elections and give your form to a voter-registration employee. Find your county\u2019s board of elections online at: https://www.sos.state.oh.us/elections/elections-officials/county-boards-of-elections-directory/. Make sure that the paperwork is at the elections office at least 30 days before the next election so your registration is changed in time for you to vote.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental activist, architect, or building engineer with a focus on sustainability and energy efficiency.

{"conversations": ["How to make a paper mosaic?", "Mosaics were traditionally made with bits of tile or glass, but it is possible to make simple ones using paper. They are a great project for school children to do while learning about different cultures throughout history. They are also a great project to do on a rainy day or over summer vacation. You can make paper mosaic masterpieces to frame and hang. You can also make paper mosaic masks to wear!\n\n## Make a simple paper mosaic\n\n1. Get some sheets of paper in different colors. Construction paper is the most popular, but you can also use scrapbook paper, paint chips, magazine pages, or even cereal boxes! What colors you need depends on your design. You don't have to use all of the colors of the rainbow. You could just use different shades of the same color, such as: light blue, medium blue, and dark blue.\n2. Cut the paper into small pieces to make your tiles. The pieces should be small, about the size of your thumbnail. You can make squares, rectangles, triangles, or even thin strips. The pieces don't have to be the same size. In fact, try to cut some smaller ones too. This way, you can fit them into tight corners. Sort your shapes by color and put them into small piles or cups. This will make it easier to find the color you need.\n3. Start gluing the pieces of paper to the outline of a shape. Lightly draw a simple shape on a sheet of paper, which will be the outline for your mosaic. When you start gluing the pieces on it, leave a small gap between each one. You can apply the glue directly to the sheet of paper, or you can apply it to the back of your tile instead. If you are using irregular shapes, including triangles, make sure that the straightest edge is on the outside of the outline\u2014otherwise, your shape will look jagged. If you are using white school glue, apply it with a paintbrush. This will keep things less messy. If you are applying the glue directly to the paper, work only in small sections at a time, or the glue will dry too fast.\n4. Glue the rest of your tiles to the inside of your shape. If your shape has designs on the inside, like spots on a butterfly wing, outline those designs first with more tiles before filling them in. Don't be afraid to cut some pieces down to help them fit! For a more professional touch, continue aligning the pieces along the outline, going smaller and smaller with each row until you reach the center.\n5. Consider filling in the background, if desired, using a contrasting color. This will make your work stand out. If you used different colors for your shape (this includes different shades of the same color), consider using just one color for the background. This will make your shape the focus. You can also leave the background blank.\n6. Set the mosaic out to dry. If you'd like to make your mosaic last longer, coat it with an acrylic sealer or a brush-on decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Let it dry before moving on.\n7. Finished.\n\n\n## Make a paper mosaic mask\n\n1. Draw a large oval or rectangle on a sheet of black paper. The shape needs to be just a little bit larger than your head. Don't cut anything out yet. Use poster paper, construction paper, or cardstock for this.\n2. Draw some shapes for the eyes, nose, and mouth. You will be cutting the eyes out, so figure out where your eyes will be when you put the mask on, and place them accordingly. Keep the nose and moth simple; you will be filling them in with tiles. A triangle for the nose and a rectangle or sausage shape for the mouth would be perfect!\n3. Cut some colored paper into small tiles. You can use construction paper, scrapbook paper, or paint chips for this. The shapes can be squares, rectangles, triangles, or even a combination of all three. They can be different sizes, but try to make them no larger than your thumbnail. You will need at least two different colors for this: one color for the mask and a contrasting color for the nose and mouth. For a different look, paint your own paper, let it dry, then cut it out. Sort your shapes by color. This will make it easier to find the color you need.\n4. Start gluing your paper tiles to the edge of your mask. Leave a small gap between each tile, and make sure that it doesn't go past the edges of the paper shape. You can use a glue stick or white school glue. If you are using white school glue, apply it using a paint brush. This will make things less messy.\n5. Glue some more tiles to the inside edges of the nose and mouth. This way, your nose and mouth won't be too big. Remember to leave a slight gap between each tile. For a cleaner finish, align any straight edges with the outline, and keep pointy edges on the inside of the shape. Use your contrasting color(s) for this. It will help them stand out better.\n6. Outline the outside of the eyes with more tiles, if desired. Don't fill the eyes in. You will be cutting them out later. You can use the same color you will use for the inside of the mask, or you can use a contrasting color.\n7. Start filling in your mask with tiles. You can glue them down randomly, or you can follow the curves of the outlines as you work your way towards the center. Remember to leave slight gaps between each tile. Use your contrasting color for the nose and mouth.\n8. Let your mask dry. If you'd like to make your mask last longer, you can seal it with a clear, acrylic sealer or a brush-on decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Remember to let the mask dry after sealing it.\n9. Cut the mask and the eyes out. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you cut the eyes out. You can cut the mask itself out using a pair of scissors, but you will need a shape craft knife (such as an Xacto knife) to cut the eyes out.\n10. Punch some holes to either side of the mask, and thread some ribbon or elastic through them. The holes should be at about ear level, or just where the eyes are on your mask. This will make the mask more comfortable to wear.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally conscious individual who is passionate about sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint.

{"conversations": ["I have a new SPA with a stateless authentication model using JWT. I am often asked to refer OAuth for authentication flows like asking me to send 'Bearer tokens' for every request instead of a simple token header but I do think that OAuth is a lot more complex than a simple JWT based authentication. What are the main differences, should I make the JWT authentication behave like OAuth?\nI am also using the JWT as my XSRF-TOKEN to prevent XSRF but I am being asked to keep them separate? Should I keep them separate? Any help here will be appreciated and might lead to a set of guidelines for the community.", "TL;DR If you have very simple scenarios, like a single client application, a single API then it might not pay off to go OAuth 2.0. On the other hand, if there are lots of different clients (browser-based, native mobile, server-side, etc) then sticking to OAuth 2.0 rules might make it more manageable than trying to roll your own system.\n\n## Detailed Answer\n\nJWT (Learn JSON Web Tokens) is just a token format. It defines a compact and self-contained mechanism for transmitting data between parties in a way that can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. Additionally, the encoding rules of a JWT also make these tokens very easy to use within the context of HTTP.\n\nBeing self-contained (the actual token contains information about a given subject), they are also a good choice for implementing stateless authentication mechanisms (aka Look mum, no sessions!). When going this route, the only thing a party must present to be granted access to a protected resource is the token itself, and the token in question can be called a bearer token.\n\nIn practice, what you're doing can already be classified as bearer token -based. However, do consider you're not using bearer tokens as specified by the OAuth 2.0 related specs (see RFC 6750). That would imply relying on the Authorization HTTP header and using the Bearer authentication scheme.\n\nRegarding the use of the JWT to prevent CSRF: Without knowing exact details it's difficult to ascertain the validity of that practice. To be honest, it does not seem correct and/or worthwhile. The following article (Cookies vs Tokens: The Definitive Guide) may be a useful read on this subject, particularly the XSS and XSRF Protection section.\n\nOne final piece of advice. Even if you don't need to go full OAuth 2.0, I would strongly recommend on passing your access token within the Authorization header instead of going with custom headers. If they are really bearer tokens, follow the rules of RFC 6750. If not, you can always create a custom authentication scheme and still use that header."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A software developer or web application engineer with experience in building single-page applications (SPAs) and implementing authentication mechanisms, specifically JWT.

Don\u2019t rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isn\u2019t available on the school\u2019s website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites.\n2. Know the difference between requests and requirements. Before you panic over the long supply list on the school\u2019s website, realize that many of the items are merely requests. One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.\n3. Purchase writing supplies. Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper. Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art. Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but it\u2019s always a good idea to check the supply list in case your child\u2019s teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners. Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.\n4. Buy folders. Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc. ).\n5. Purchase a day planner. Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.\n6. Buy art supplies. Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.\n7. Purchase personal supplies. Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack. Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.\n8. Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag. Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time. However, textbooks haven\u2019t gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.\n\n\n## Shop for electronics\n\n1. Buy a calculator. High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:\n\t* Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30. Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.\n2. Purchase a computer. High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list. Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget.\n3. Buy external storage. Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.\n\n\n## Save money\n\n1. Sort out what you already have. Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldn\u2019t mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s). Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt. Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.\n2. Stick to basics and generics. Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Don\u2019t worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs.\n3. Take advantage of discounts. Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back. Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.\n4. Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks. Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.\n5. Buy refurbished. Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost. However, you should do your homework first. Only buy refurbished products from trusted retailers like Apple or Best Buy, which offer warranties and free repairs on known issues.\n6. Buy a little at a time throughout the year. There\u2019s no rule that you have to buy school supplies in July and August. Each time you\u2019re shopping for groceries or picking up a prescription, stop by the school supply aisle to look for unannounced discounts on common required supplies.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally-conscious small business owner or manager seeking practical strategies to minimize their carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable future.

{"conversations": ["How to become hot?", "Being hot is more than just a look\u2014it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you\u2019ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don\u2019t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today\u2019s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you\u2019re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you\u2019ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don\u2019t forget how much you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you\u2019ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don\u2019t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that\u2019s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don\u2019t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the \u201cperfect\u201d body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts \u2013 instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You\u2019ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There\u2019s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can\u2019t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you\u2019re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they\u2019re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men\u2019s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you\u2019d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate amount of skin. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it\u2019s not surprising when people can\u2019t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it\u2019s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It\u2019s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer\u2019s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body\u2019s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn\u2019t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren\u2019t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It\u2019s easy to start slumping forward when you\u2019re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they\u2019re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It\u2019s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It\u2019s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don\u2019t try so hard. Or at least look like you\u2019re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you\u2019re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It\u2019s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It\u2019s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you\u2019re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone\u2019s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don\u2019t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they\u2019re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental scientist, sustainability consultant, or eco-conscious individual with a keen interest in climate change mitigation strategies.

{"conversations": ["How to kill a fly?", "Flies can be annoying pests, especially inside your home. If you can\u2019t remove the flies humanely, you may want to kill them. Use a flyswatter for an easy way to kill a few lone flies. Try using sprays to get rid of numerous flies. You can also kill flies with bait and traps, like fly tape, DIY traps, or Venus fly traps. Eliminating flies can be done quickly, easily, and cheaply, whether you have a single fly or dozens to remove.\n\n## Use a flyswatter\n\n1. Wait for the fly to land. Keep your eye on the fly until it lands, then get ready to make your move. Approach the fly silently and slowly so it doesn't fly away. If you don\u2019t have a flyswatter, you can use other objects with a flat surface, like a newspaper, shoe, or book.\n2. Swat the fly with a quick, downward motion. Raise your flyswatter above your head, and bring it down over the fly in a single, strong move. You are crushing the fly between your flyswatter and a hard surface. If you miss the fly the first time, wait for it to land and swat again.\n3. Wipe up the fly and clean off your flyswatter. Rinse the flyswatter in soap and water, and use a tissue or paper towel to wipe up the mess. Make sure to wash your hands! You can also disinfect with a cleaning solution to prevent spreading any germs.\n4. Try using an electric flyswatter for an easier, efficient option. Electric flyswatters are devices that lure in flies with a light and kill them upon contact. Stand near the fly with your electric flyswatter to kill it effortlessly and quickly. Be sure to read over instructions carefully before use. Avoid touching the racket area, and always let the flyswatter fully cool down before storing it.\n\n\n## Spray the fly\n\n1. Choose from either chemical sprays, household cleaners, or hairspray. Chemical sprays kill flies instantly upon contact, though they contain harsh chemicals. You can also spray the flies with household cleaners, like Windex or Formula 409, or with an aerosol like hairspray. All of these sprays will help you kill a fly. Purchase chemical fly sprays at home supply stores. Look for brands like Hot Shot and Raid. Use spray if you want to remove many flies very quickly. Chemical sprays will kill them the fastest, though they have harmful chemicals. Household cleaners are a cheaper alternative, and you likely have them at home already.\n2. Spray the air near the fly thoroughly. Spray the fly while it is in the air or when the fly lands. Hold in the trigger to release the spray, and spray directly into the air around the fly. You want to saturate the fly in the spray. If you are using chemical sprays, the fly will die instantly. If you are using household cleaners or hairspray, the spray will coat the fly's wings, making it impossible to fly. The fly will still die, just not as quickly as with chemicals.\n3. Leave the room after you spray any hazardous chemical. The chemicals contained in most fly sprays are toxic and lethal. Household cleaners also use chemicals, though not quite as toxic. Avoid inhaling these chemicals by leaving the room immediately after you spray. Leave the room for both chemical sprays and household cleaners. If you have pets or children, they should also avoid the room until the chemicals have settled. You can wait about an hour before reentering the room, so the chemicals can dissipate. This will depend on how ventilated your room is and how much chemical you spray. It is safe to come back into the room when you no longer smell the chemicals.\n4. Dispose of the dead fly and wash your hands. Scoop up the dead flies with a paper towel or tissue, and throw them in the trash can. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water! If you killed multiple flies, throw them all away before you wash your hands.\n\n\n## Remove fly with trap\n\n1. Hang fly paper in areas with many flies for a cheap and easy option. Fly papers, or fly ribbons, are strips of paper coated in a sticky attractant. Flies approach the paper because they are attracted to the smell, and they get stuck to the paper and die. You can hang fly paper near your entrances, above your windows, or next to your trash can, for example. Fly paper can be hung up indoors or outdoors. Replace your fly paper after you collect a handful of dead flies.\n2. Make your own trap for a cost effective solution. You can make your own trap with sugar water, a jar, and a paper cone. Cut a small hole around the point of the paper cone. Pour 1 part sugar and 2 parts water into the jar, and place the cone upside down inside the jar. The flies will be attracted to the sweet smell, and once they are inside, they will get stuck and drown in the liquid. You can add a piece of cut fruit to the jar to tempt the flies further. Try a piece of apple. You can also add a mix of sugar and water to a plastic bottle instead of a jar.\n3. Set out a Venus flytrap for a natural, hands-off option. Venus flytraps are carnivorous plants that feed on insects. The flytrap has a reddish, sweet-smelling interior, which insects mistake as a flower. A fly will land inside, and the flytrap will snap shut. The fly cannot escape, and the flytrap will consume the fly. Place your flytrap in areas popular fly areas, like your kitchen or near your door. Purchase Venus flytraps at most home supply stores or garden centers.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally conscious individual, possibly a sustainability advocate or a concerned citizen.

That didn\u2019t happen until Modern English with a few productive examples in the 17\u1d57\u02b0 century but most coming from the 19\u1d57\u02b0 century or after.  As Janus mentions in comments, the de- word meaning the same thing, decapitate, was imported in full with the de- already there, from Latin via French, in the 17\u1d57\u02b0 century.\n\nThere are many different possible senses of be- in verbs; the OED lists six different primary senses with subsenses.  This here in behead is one of the rarer ones. Under be- sense 6c, it says that this privative sense of be- used to create behead is an ancient sense that means bereave of:\n\n  \nForming trans. verbs on substantives used in an instrumental relation; the primary idea being; \n* a. To surround, cover, or bedaub with, as in becloud, to put clouds about, cover with clouds, bedew. Thence, by extension,\n* b. To affect with in any way, as in benight, beguile, befriend. In both sets there is often an accompanying notion of \u2018thoroughly, excessively,\u2019 as in 2.\n* c.

{"conversations": ["How to make a cat tree?", "Cats are natural climbers, and will happily crawl all over tall structures. A homemade cat tree will provide your kitty with hours of entertainment, and can be built at a fraction of the cost of cat trees available at a pet store. With some tools and dedication, you can make a customized cat tree based on your cat's personality!\n\n## Build a cat tree from wood and carpet\n\n1. Design your cat tree. Before purchasing materials or starting to build, you need a design plan, which you can sketch out on a piece of paper to determine your materials shopping list. There are several things to consider when designing your cat tree. First, consider your space limitations. Determine where your cat tree will be placed, and what size will fit well into that space. It's a good idea to take measurements to ensure your finished product will fit the space. You should also consider your cat's personality. If your cat likes to climb, consider building a tall cat tree with several perches. If your cat would like a private place to hide or sleep, consider building in a covered sleeping nook. Finally, you should keep your carpentry skills in mind. If you are relatively inexperienced with building things and using tools, keep your design simple so that you aren't overwhelmed. If you're at a loss for where to begin, there are several websites that have pictures of do-it-yourself cat trees you can use for inspiration, or even patterns for cat trees other people have made.\n2. Buy your materials. Use your design plan to determine which materials you will need. Plywood works well for horizontal platforms; dimensional lumber and cardboard or PVC pipe work well for vertical supports, and carpet is ideal for covering the wood. You may also need the following tools to assemble your tree:\n\t* A drill and some wood screws\n\t* An electric stapler\n\t* A table saw and a handsaw\n\t* A Hammer and nails\n\t* A carpet or utility knife\n\t* Wood glue or another powerful adhesive\n\t* If you want to create covered areas for your cat to perch, you may also want to pick up a concrete form tube. These heavy-duty cardboard tubes make great perches and tunnels for cats. These can also be cut lengthwise using a utility knife to create concave platforms or open-topped beds for your cat.\n3. Cut all materials to size. Using your plan as a guide, cut all the plywood and lumber sections to size. A simple hand saw works well for cutting dimensional lumber, while a handheld circular saw or table saw is better for cutting sheets of plywood. Sand rough edges if desired.\n4. Build the base of your cat tree. The tree needs a sturdy base, which should extend farther out from the center than any other platform or component of the tree in order to prevent tipping. To make the base, a good option is to cut 2 squares of plywood to size and glue them together for extra thickness. A 24\" (60 cm) square works well for a basic cat tree, but the taller your tree, the larger you'll want to make the base, to ensure it is sturdy.\n5. Cover the base in carpet. Before attaching any vertical supports, it's best to cover the base with carpet or a thick upholstery fabric. Cut the carpet to size, making it a few inches larger than the base on all sides. Then, wrap its edges over the edges of the plywood base, and staple it in place on the underside of the base with a staple gun. You may need to cut small notches in the carpet at the corners to make it fold neatly beneath the base.\n6. Attach the vertical supports to the base. The vertical supports that will hold up your platforms can be attached to the base with screws, nails, bolts or wood glue. Flip the base over so the carpeted side is face down. Then, drill holes through the underside of the base in the spots where you want the supports to be. Attach the supports by inserting screws or nails through the holes and driving them into the supports. You may want to cover the supports with carpet before attaching them, as this will be easier than doing it after they are already secured in place. To make your cat tree double as a scratching post, wrap one or more of the supports in sisal rope, securing each end with wire brads or staples, placed where they will be out view and won't be scratched by the cat. If you use staples, you may need to tap them down with a hammer to make sure they don't stick out too much.\n7. Attach the horizontal perches to the supports. The plywood perches can be attached using wood screws and/or gluing them to the tops of the vertical members. Wrap them in carpet or fabric after affixing them, so that the screws aren't visible through the carpet, and staple the carpet in place on the underside as you did with the base.\n8. Continue building according to your design. Continue to affix each component, referring back to your plan for measurements and placement. Adjustments to your design can be made as you go to account for stability issues, new ideas, or incorrect measurements.\n\n\n## Build a cat tree from a ladder\n\n1. Obtain a ladder. For this simple, unique cat tree, you'll need an old wooden ladder. Look around at garage sales, thrift furniture stores, and antique stores for one 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2 m) high. Choose an old-fashioned ladder that looks like an upside-down \"v\" with several steps on either side that are at matching levels. It's fine if the wood looks old, but make sure the foundation of the ladder isn't too rickety. You want to be certain your cat tree won't tip over and hurt your cat. Try to find a ladder that's around four feet tall. A very tall ladder my be less stable or too tall for your cat.\n2. Gather your supplies. The ladder is going to be the base of the tree, but you'll need to alter it a bit to make it more cat friendly. Gather these supplies:\n\t* A piece of plywood long and wide enough to rest on two rungs of the ladder at the same level. This will provide a platform for your cat. If you want more than one platform, you'll need more than one piece of plywood. A hammer and 2\" nails\n\t* Carpet\n\t* An electric staple gun\n\t* A piece of canvas, denim, or other sturdy fabric you can use to create a hammock between the two bottom rungs\n\t* A can of paint (optional)\n\t* A toy that hangs from a piece of rope or string\n\t* Sisal rope to wrap around the legs of the ladder\n3. Sand and paint your ladder and wood pieces. Use fine-grain sandpaper to sand down the ladder and remove any jagged edges or splinters. Do the same to the pieces of plywood you bought. Paint the ladder and plywood pieces with a coat or two of paint, if you're using it. Let the paint dry completely. Use your imagination when it comes time to paint. You could just paint the ladder to match your existing decor. But you could also paint it brown and green to make it look like a tree, or use stencils to make designs up and down the sides. Instead of painting the platforms, you can make them more comfortable for you cat by covering them in carpet, attaching it to to the platforms after nailing them into place. Use your staple gun and affix the carpet with staples in the perimeter and in the center. Make sure they don't stick up from the platform, tapping them down with a hammer if necessary.\n4. Nail the plywood platforms to the ladder. Position the first piece of plywood so that it is lined up across two ladder rungs of equal height. Use the hammer and four nails to nail the plywood into the wooden rungs, placing one nail in each corner of the plywood. Make sure the platforms are very secure when you're finished nailing them down. You may wish to use more nails, or substitute wood screws for a firmer hold. If you have a second piece of plywood to create another level, use the same procedure to nail it down.\n5. Install the hammock. Many cats enjoy sleeping in hammocks. If you'd like to add one to your cat tree, measure and cut your piece of cloth so that its four corners stretch between the four legs of the ladder. Nail or staple a corner of the fabric to the inside of each leg, making sure that the nails are all at the exact same height. Be sure the fabric you use for the hammock is thick enough to hold the weight of your cat. You can double the fabric or hem the edges before nailing it down to make it sturdier. Fabric that stretches a little is ideal for cat hammocks. Make sure nails or staples do not protrude in such a way that your cat could be scratched or cut. Tap your staples with hammer if necessary. Instead of a hammock, you can also use a carpeted concrete form tube, fastened to the ladder by attaching it to two 2X4 pieces of lumber secured to the base of the ladder with bolts, nails, or screws, between the legs. This will make your cat tree less portable, but also sturdier.\n6. Wrap the ladder legs in rope. If you want the cat tree to double as a scratching post, you can wrap the bottom of the ladder legs in strong, coarse rope. Cut the rope in four pieces. Use staples to secure the end of the first piece of rope to the inside of the base of one of the legs. Wrap the leg tightly with rope, tapping it down with a hammer if necessary. Secure the other end with a staple, making sure it is away from any areas the cat is most likely to scratch often. Repeat with the other four legs. If you want to, you can cover the legs entirely with rope, from top to bottom, using a new piece of rope between each rung of the ladder. This will allow your cat access to a scratchable surface nearly anywhere on its new cat tree.\n7. Finish up. Hang the toy you bought from the top of the ladder, somewhere the cat will be able to reach it, so as to entice your cat to come and play. Add any other finishing touches you want to make your cat tree unique and fun for your cat.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A creative and environmentally-conscious individual who enjoys crafting and upcycling household items.

{"conversations": ["Why can't we kill ourselves by holding our breath?", "## Short answer\nHealthy people cannot hold their breaths until unconsciousness sets in, let alone commit suicide.\n\n## Background\nAccording to Parkes (2005), a normal person cannot even hold their breath to unconsciousness, let alone death. Parkes says:\n\n  Breath\u2010holding is a voluntary act, but normal subjects appear unable\n  to breath\u2010hold to unconsciousness. A powerful involuntary mechanism\n  normally overrides voluntary breath\u2010holding and causes the breath that\n  defines the breakpoint.\n\nParkes explains that voluntary breath\u2010holding does not stop the central respiratory rhythm. Instead, breath holding merely suppresses its expression by voluntarily holding the chest at a certain volume. At the time of writing, no simple explanation for the break point existed. It is known to be caused by partial pressures of blood gases activating the carotid arterial chemoreceptors. They are peripheral sensory neurons that detect changes in chemical concentrations, including low oxygen (hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide (hypercapnia). Both hypoxia and hypercapnia are signs of breath holding and both are detected by the chemoreceptors. These receptors send nerve signals to the vasomotor center of the medulla which eventually overrides the conscious breath holding.\n\nThe breaking point can be postponed by large lung inflations, hyperoxia and hypocapnia, and it is shortened by increased metabolic rates.\n\nReference\n- Parkes, Exp Physiol (2006); 91(1): 1-15"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A curious and inquisitive individual with an interest in biology, physiology, or medicine.

{"conversations": ["How to become hot?", "Being hot is more than just a look\u2014it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you\u2019ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don\u2019t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today\u2019s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you\u2019re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you\u2019ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don\u2019t forget how much you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you\u2019ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don\u2019t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that\u2019s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don\u2019t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the \u201cperfect\u201d body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts \u2013 instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You\u2019ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There\u2019s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can\u2019t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you\u2019re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they\u2019re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men\u2019s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you\u2019d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate amount of skin. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it\u2019s not surprising when people can\u2019t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it\u2019s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It\u2019s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer\u2019s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body\u2019s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn\u2019t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren\u2019t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It\u2019s easy to start slumping forward when you\u2019re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they\u2019re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It\u2019s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It\u2019s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don\u2019t try so hard. Or at least look like you\u2019re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you\u2019re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It\u2019s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It\u2019s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you\u2019re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone\u2019s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don\u2019t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they\u2019re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental scientist, sustainability consultant, or eco-conscious individual with a keen interest in climate change mitigation strategies.

Is it required the other way round, that if a class contains all the static methods, shall the class be static too? What are static classes good for?", "Java has static nested classes but it sounds like you're looking for a top-level static class. Java has no way of making a top-level class static but you can simulate a static class like this:\n\n* Declare your class ```final``` - Prevents extension of the class since extending a static class makes no sense\n* Make the constructor ```private``` - Prevents instantiation by client code as it makes no sense to instantiate a static class\n* Make all the members and functions of the class ```static``` -  Since the class cannot be instantiated no instance methods can be called or instance fields accessed\n* Note that the compiler will not prevent you from declaring an instance (non-static) member. The issue will only show up if you attempt to call the instance member\n\nSimple example per suggestions from above:\n```public class TestMyStaticClass {\n     public static void main(String []args){\n        MyStaticClass.setMyStaticMember(5);\n        System.out.println(\"Static value: \" + MyStaticClass.getMyStaticMember());\n        System.out.println(\"Value squared: \" + MyStaticClass.squareMyStaticMember());\n        // MyStaticClass x = new MyStaticClass(); // results in compile time error\n     }\n}\n// A top-level Java class mimicking static class behavior\npublic final class MyStaticClass {\n    private MyStaticClass () { // private constructor\n        myStaticMember = 1;\n    }\n    private static int myStaticMember;\n    public static void setMyStaticMember(int val) {\n        myStaticMember = val;\n    }\n    public static int getMyStaticMember() {\n        return myStaticMember;\n    }\n    public static int squareMyStaticMember() {\n        return myStaticMember * myStaticMember;\n    }\n}\n```\nWhat good are static classes? A good use of a static class is in defining one-off, utility and/or library classes where instantiation would not make sense. A great example is the Math class that contains some mathematical constants such as PI and E and simply provides mathematical calculations. Requiring instantiation in such a case would be unnecessary and confusing. See the ```Math``` class and source code. Notice that it is ```final``` and all of its members are ```static```.

{"conversations": ["How to kill a fly?", "Flies can be annoying pests, especially inside your home. If you can\u2019t remove the flies humanely, you may want to kill them. Use a flyswatter for an easy way to kill a few lone flies. Try using sprays to get rid of numerous flies. You can also kill flies with bait and traps, like fly tape, DIY traps, or Venus fly traps. Eliminating flies can be done quickly, easily, and cheaply, whether you have a single fly or dozens to remove.\n\n## Use a flyswatter\n\n1. Wait for the fly to land. Keep your eye on the fly until it lands, then get ready to make your move. Approach the fly silently and slowly so it doesn't fly away. If you don\u2019t have a flyswatter, you can use other objects with a flat surface, like a newspaper, shoe, or book.\n2. Swat the fly with a quick, downward motion. Raise your flyswatter above your head, and bring it down over the fly in a single, strong move. You are crushing the fly between your flyswatter and a hard surface. If you miss the fly the first time, wait for it to land and swat again.\n3. Wipe up the fly and clean off your flyswatter. Rinse the flyswatter in soap and water, and use a tissue or paper towel to wipe up the mess. Make sure to wash your hands! You can also disinfect with a cleaning solution to prevent spreading any germs.\n4. Try using an electric flyswatter for an easier, efficient option. Electric flyswatters are devices that lure in flies with a light and kill them upon contact. Stand near the fly with your electric flyswatter to kill it effortlessly and quickly. Be sure to read over instructions carefully before use. Avoid touching the racket area, and always let the flyswatter fully cool down before storing it.\n\n\n## Spray the fly\n\n1. Choose from either chemical sprays, household cleaners, or hairspray. Chemical sprays kill flies instantly upon contact, though they contain harsh chemicals. You can also spray the flies with household cleaners, like Windex or Formula 409, or with an aerosol like hairspray. All of these sprays will help you kill a fly. Purchase chemical fly sprays at home supply stores. Look for brands like Hot Shot and Raid. Use spray if you want to remove many flies very quickly. Chemical sprays will kill them the fastest, though they have harmful chemicals. Household cleaners are a cheaper alternative, and you likely have them at home already.\n2. Spray the air near the fly thoroughly. Spray the fly while it is in the air or when the fly lands. Hold in the trigger to release the spray, and spray directly into the air around the fly. You want to saturate the fly in the spray. If you are using chemical sprays, the fly will die instantly. If you are using household cleaners or hairspray, the spray will coat the fly's wings, making it impossible to fly. The fly will still die, just not as quickly as with chemicals.\n3. Leave the room after you spray any hazardous chemical. The chemicals contained in most fly sprays are toxic and lethal. Household cleaners also use chemicals, though not quite as toxic. Avoid inhaling these chemicals by leaving the room immediately after you spray. Leave the room for both chemical sprays and household cleaners. If you have pets or children, they should also avoid the room until the chemicals have settled. You can wait about an hour before reentering the room, so the chemicals can dissipate. This will depend on how ventilated your room is and how much chemical you spray. It is safe to come back into the room when you no longer smell the chemicals.\n4. Dispose of the dead fly and wash your hands. Scoop up the dead flies with a paper towel or tissue, and throw them in the trash can. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water! If you killed multiple flies, throw them all away before you wash your hands.\n\n\n## Remove fly with trap\n\n1. Hang fly paper in areas with many flies for a cheap and easy option. Fly papers, or fly ribbons, are strips of paper coated in a sticky attractant. Flies approach the paper because they are attracted to the smell, and they get stuck to the paper and die. You can hang fly paper near your entrances, above your windows, or next to your trash can, for example. Fly paper can be hung up indoors or outdoors. Replace your fly paper after you collect a handful of dead flies.\n2. Make your own trap for a cost effective solution. You can make your own trap with sugar water, a jar, and a paper cone. Cut a small hole around the point of the paper cone. Pour 1 part sugar and 2 parts water into the jar, and place the cone upside down inside the jar. The flies will be attracted to the sweet smell, and once they are inside, they will get stuck and drown in the liquid. You can add a piece of cut fruit to the jar to tempt the flies further. Try a piece of apple. You can also add a mix of sugar and water to a plastic bottle instead of a jar.\n3. Set out a Venus flytrap for a natural, hands-off option. Venus flytraps are carnivorous plants that feed on insects. The flytrap has a reddish, sweet-smelling interior, which insects mistake as a flower. A fly will land inside, and the flytrap will snap shut. The fly cannot escape, and the flytrap will consume the fly. Place your flytrap in areas popular fly areas, like your kitchen or near your door. Purchase Venus flytraps at most home supply stores or garden centers.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally conscious individual, possibly a sustainability advocate or a concerned citizen.

{"conversations": ["How to save gift wrapping paper?", "We've all seen promotional material for having \"green\" (environmentally sound) events, conserving paper, and saving trees.  In this article we'll see several alternatives to one time usage of rolls of wrapping paper for gifts.\n\n## Reuse wrap paper\n\n1. Wrap the gift in such a way as to promote reuse: When selecting wrapping paper, select paper which is durable. When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.\n2. Unwrap the gift for reuse, too. When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper. Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.\n3. Share the paper with several guests. If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.\n\n\n## Use gift bag with a gift tag\n\n1. Purchase a nice gift bag (or reusable bag), rather than wrapping paper for each gift.\n2. Make and attach a large gift tag to the bottom of the bag covering the manufacturers name, etc. Include at least 12 rows on the tag. Write your name, email, occasion and date on the first row of the tag.\n3. Place gift item in bag and present to honoree as usual. After honoree removes the gift from the bag, they save the bag for the next occasion.\n4. When the honoree has an occasion to give a gift, they write their name, occasion and date on the first blank line on the tag.\n5. Repeat the re-use and gifting process 12 times.\n6. Have the twelfth person to receive the gift bag send an email to everyone listed on the tag with the bag's history. Assuming the bag remains in usable condition, they can then attach a new tag on top of the original tag and repeat the process.\n7. Keep the reuse and gifting chain going until the back is too worn to continue. Ultimately, recycle the bag.\n\n\n## Make a gift display rather than gift wrap\n\n1. Bring unwrapped gifts to the celebration.\n2. Place the gifts on a display table. Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.\n3. Prepare a one page log for the honoree. It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift. The honoree can then use this log to send Thank You notes. Only one sheet of paper is consumed for the entire event!\n4. When it is time to present the gifts, position the honoree behind the table along with the guests. Take photos of the covered table, uncover the table and photograph the table displaying the gifts. (Optionally, make a video of the table being uncovered.)\n\n\n## Gift wrap (blindfold) the honoree instead of the gift\n\n1. If your honoree is adventuresome, blindfold them with an attractive looking bandana or blindfold prior to displaying or presenting any gifts.\n2. Present each gift to the blindfolded honoree while the people giving the gift stand behind them.\n3. Have the honoree identify the gift by feeling of it. If you want to make the task more challenging have the honoree wear attractive looking gloves or mittens while doing this. Optionally, have the honoree guess who gave them the gift.\n4. Of course, take numerous photos (and possibly video) of the gift giving process.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A budget-conscious individual who enjoys gift-giving and is looking for ways to reduce waste and save money.

{"conversations": ["How to reduce smog?", "Smog is a form of air pollution that is produced in the atmosphere when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC). When this reaction occurs, particles are released into the atmosphere, and oxygen at the ground level absorbs harmful compounds (ozone). All of this creates what we consider smog. Recent years have seen an increase in campaigns for the reduction of smog due to its harmful effects towards both humans and the environment.\n\n## Change your car habit\n\n1. Drive less. Vehicles that run only on gasoline produce nitrogen dioxide as a byproduct of driving and idling, so one easy way to cut back on emissions is to drive less. Try walking, biking, or taking public transit instead. If your location is close enough, try walking or biking, especially if the destination has showers for clean up (workplace, gym, etc.). Many large cities offer public transportation such as buses, subways, trains and \"park and ride\" which allows you to park your vehicle and take public transit to your destination. Don't drive during certain times. For example, drive less during peak traffic periods, when it is extremely hot, or when there are ozone warnings in effect. This is because gas fumes turn into harmful ground level ozone when they heat up. If driving is a necessity, try setting up a carpool so there are fewer cars on the road and fewer trips being made.\n2. Maintain your car. Keeping your car \"healthy\" will not only improve mileage and save money, it can also reduce emissions. Get regular tune-ups and oil changes and make sure your tires are properly inflated to ensure your car is functioning at its best. Many states require smog and emission tests to make sure your car isn't emitting too much pollution. These are usually required annually or bi-annually. Inflating your tires to the correct pressure allows the engine to function better by maintaining a steady load. Consult your mechanic or your owner's manual for specific information regarding maintenance for your vehicle.\n3. Fuel up in cooler temperatures. Pump gas early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures drop. This prevents the fumes from gasoline from heating up and creating harmful toxins at ground level (ozone). There are alternative fuel sources that are in the works such as ethanol, natural gas, and hydrogen, but not all engines can function off of these fuel sources.\n4. Purchase a hybrid or electric vehicle. These vehicles have been known to dramatically reduce emissions for many reasons (depending on the type of model). Some decrease the consumption of fuel while others do away with fuel altogether. The result is a reduction in tailpipe emissions and therefore a reduction in smog. Hybrid vehicles are fueled by gasoline alone but have the ability to recapture energy and use it to power the car, resulting in less fuel consumption. Electric vehicles are powered by electricity alone and must be plugged in and charged in order to drive. Plug-in hybrids are the best of both worlds, running off of either electricity or gasoline.\n\n\n## Change your consumption habit\n\n1. Avoid high VOC products. VOCs are chemicals that easily escape into the atmosphere through common use around the house. Check the front label of household products to determine if they contain VOCs. Examples of common products include nail care products (acetone, ethyl alcohol), paint strippers or adhesive removers (methylene chloride), and aerosol spray products (butane). Check the National Institute of Health's Household Products Database for more information about specific products and their ingredients. Shop for \"green\" products that don't contain VOCs. If you must use VOC products, buy in small quantities that can be used quickly instead of stored. If you must store the product, do so in a tightly sealed, original container, in a well-ventilated area.\n2. Avoid gas-powered yard equipment. Gasoline emissions are one of the major causes of smog--whether from vehicles or lawn equipment. Try eco-friendly lawn mowers, hedgers, trimmers, or any other lawn equipment that can be powered electrically. You can also avoid mowing altogether by changing the material in your yard. Opt for artificial grass, succulents, hard landscapes, or rock gardens to do away with mowing forever. This will also save you time and money spent on maintenance and watering. There are also \"real grass alternatives\" that look and act like traditional grass turf, but require less maintenance.\n3. Buy local. When you buy products that are made locally, it cuts down on the cost of transport which reduces emissions. Local farmers' markets and grocery stores can help you determine where items were produced. There are many sites online that link local buyers and sellers such as Direct Local Food, GrowBuyEat, and AgLocal. Besides farmers' markets, try local farmers' stands, farms, and wineries. There are even many restaurants that are joining the movement towards supporting locally grown items. Make a community garden. Grow vegetables and fruit for your community and local distribution.\n4. Be energy efficient in your home. The less energy you consume at home, the less pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. There are many ways to decrease energy consumption including through lighting, heating and cooling, and appliance use. Replace your old incandescent light bulbs with energy saving halogen incandescents, CFLs, and LEDs which can be found at your local hardware store. For heating and cooling try energy-saving thermostats that automatically reset temperatures while you're away from home. Shop for energy-efficient appliances that use less energy such as washers, dryers, refrigerators, and dishwashers.\n\n\n## Take a stand\n\n1. Don't support organizations that have poor environmental practices. By not supporting commerce from these companies, you raise awareness of the problem. For example, companies like Nestle, Pfizer, and Walmart have been known to not only add pollution to the air but to also violate pollution regulations. An app such as Buycott can help you identify products and companies with poor environmental track records, simply by scanning a product's barcode.\n2. Promote your stance. Don't be afraid to tell people your opinion on the issue, and what you are doing to help solve it. You can do this by speaking to those closest to you (family, friends, co-workers) or reach more people through social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube). Start a community project such as an initiative to replace light bulbs or a carpool to a farmer's market once a month. Start a carpool with your co-workers. Not only will it cut down on emissions but it will demonstrate your passion for the cause.\n3. Contact local politicians and business leaders. Ask them for information about what they are doing to reduce smog levels in your community. If they do not reply or reply with inadequate measures, consider lobbying for change. Sign a petition. There are many petitions online that are lobbying for better air quality control by our government. Find one that peaks your interest, or start your own. Try sites like change.org or petitions.whitehouse.gov to look for petitions or start one on a smaller, local level.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental activist, marine biologist, or a concerned citizen with a strong interest in sustainability and ocean conservation.

{"conversations": ["How to do a deep treatment?", "A deep moisturizing treatment, protein treatment, or hair mask, can be store bought or homemade. A deep treatment is a great way to improve dry or damaged hair because it moisturizes and strengthens the hair. Read on to learn how to apply one!\n\n## Basic deep treatment\n\n1. Obtain the deep treatment. You can buy one from a store or make your own see below for recipes in \"Related wikiHows\" that you can make at home.\n2. Wash your hair. The hair should be freshly washed before applying the treatment so it can soak in properly. Don't wait until your hair dries to apply the treatment.\n3. Apply the deep treatment to your whole head of hair. Use a comb or brush to distribute the product.\n4. Put your hair up in a towel turban, shower cap, heating cap, etc. This will keep the deep treatment on your hair, and not on your clothes.\n5. Wait for 15 minutes to an hour. Or you can sleep while wearing the deep treatment.\n6. Take the cap off, rinse your hair, and style as usual.\n7. Enjoy your soft, moisturized hair!\n\n\n## Avocado mask deep treatment\n\n1. Get your ingredients. For your deep conditioning mask, you'll need 1 egg-white, 1 avocado, a tablespoon of olive oil, and a tablespoon of honey. These measurements can be altered depending on how long and thick you hair is.\n2. Mix the ingredients. Using a blender or food processor, add all your ingredients and blend them on high until a creamy consistency has formed. If you don't have a blender, you can mash the ingredients together manually, but it will take a bit more time.\n3. Apply the mixture to your hair. Scoop some of the mask onto your fingertips, and spread it throughout your hair, focusing primarily on the ends of each strand. When you've used all of the mask, you can wrap your hair up in a shower-cap to prevent the mask from rubbing off on your clothes.\n4. Let the mask set. Leave the mask for 20-30 minutes to allow time for it to soak into your hair. You can leave it on for longer if you would like, but make sure that you wait at least 20 minutes.\n5. Rinse out the mask. Remove your shower-cap and run your hair under warm water in the shower. Using just the warm water, wash out all of the remaining mask. If you need to, you can use shampoo, but try to avoid it because it will dry out your hair again. When you're finished washing your hair out, dry your hair with a towel.\n6. Repeat the process. You can apply this mask to your hair 1-2 times a week for the optimal results. Otherwise, apply this avocado mask to your hair whenever it starts to appear dull, frizzy, or is dry and damaged to the touch.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A digital marketing specialist or strategy consultant with a focus on content marketing.

{"conversations": ["How to kill a fly?", "Flies can be annoying pests, especially inside your home. If you can\u2019t remove the flies humanely, you may want to kill them. Use a flyswatter for an easy way to kill a few lone flies. Try using sprays to get rid of numerous flies. You can also kill flies with bait and traps, like fly tape, DIY traps, or Venus fly traps. Eliminating flies can be done quickly, easily, and cheaply, whether you have a single fly or dozens to remove.\n\n## Use a flyswatter\n\n1. Wait for the fly to land. Keep your eye on the fly until it lands, then get ready to make your move. Approach the fly silently and slowly so it doesn't fly away. If you don\u2019t have a flyswatter, you can use other objects with a flat surface, like a newspaper, shoe, or book.\n2. Swat the fly with a quick, downward motion. Raise your flyswatter above your head, and bring it down over the fly in a single, strong move. You are crushing the fly between your flyswatter and a hard surface. If you miss the fly the first time, wait for it to land and swat again.\n3. Wipe up the fly and clean off your flyswatter. Rinse the flyswatter in soap and water, and use a tissue or paper towel to wipe up the mess. Make sure to wash your hands! You can also disinfect with a cleaning solution to prevent spreading any germs.\n4. Try using an electric flyswatter for an easier, efficient option. Electric flyswatters are devices that lure in flies with a light and kill them upon contact. Stand near the fly with your electric flyswatter to kill it effortlessly and quickly. Be sure to read over instructions carefully before use. Avoid touching the racket area, and always let the flyswatter fully cool down before storing it.\n\n\n## Spray the fly\n\n1. Choose from either chemical sprays, household cleaners, or hairspray. Chemical sprays kill flies instantly upon contact, though they contain harsh chemicals. You can also spray the flies with household cleaners, like Windex or Formula 409, or with an aerosol like hairspray. All of these sprays will help you kill a fly. Purchase chemical fly sprays at home supply stores. Look for brands like Hot Shot and Raid. Use spray if you want to remove many flies very quickly. Chemical sprays will kill them the fastest, though they have harmful chemicals. Household cleaners are a cheaper alternative, and you likely have them at home already.\n2. Spray the air near the fly thoroughly. Spray the fly while it is in the air or when the fly lands. Hold in the trigger to release the spray, and spray directly into the air around the fly. You want to saturate the fly in the spray. If you are using chemical sprays, the fly will die instantly. If you are using household cleaners or hairspray, the spray will coat the fly's wings, making it impossible to fly. The fly will still die, just not as quickly as with chemicals.\n3. Leave the room after you spray any hazardous chemical. The chemicals contained in most fly sprays are toxic and lethal. Household cleaners also use chemicals, though not quite as toxic. Avoid inhaling these chemicals by leaving the room immediately after you spray. Leave the room for both chemical sprays and household cleaners. If you have pets or children, they should also avoid the room until the chemicals have settled. You can wait about an hour before reentering the room, so the chemicals can dissipate. This will depend on how ventilated your room is and how much chemical you spray. It is safe to come back into the room when you no longer smell the chemicals.\n4. Dispose of the dead fly and wash your hands. Scoop up the dead flies with a paper towel or tissue, and throw them in the trash can. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water! If you killed multiple flies, throw them all away before you wash your hands.\n\n\n## Remove fly with trap\n\n1. Hang fly paper in areas with many flies for a cheap and easy option. Fly papers, or fly ribbons, are strips of paper coated in a sticky attractant. Flies approach the paper because they are attracted to the smell, and they get stuck to the paper and die. You can hang fly paper near your entrances, above your windows, or next to your trash can, for example. Fly paper can be hung up indoors or outdoors. Replace your fly paper after you collect a handful of dead flies.\n2. Make your own trap for a cost effective solution. You can make your own trap with sugar water, a jar, and a paper cone. Cut a small hole around the point of the paper cone. Pour 1 part sugar and 2 parts water into the jar, and place the cone upside down inside the jar. The flies will be attracted to the sweet smell, and once they are inside, they will get stuck and drown in the liquid. You can add a piece of cut fruit to the jar to tempt the flies further. Try a piece of apple. You can also add a mix of sugar and water to a plastic bottle instead of a jar.\n3. Set out a Venus flytrap for a natural, hands-off option. Venus flytraps are carnivorous plants that feed on insects. The flytrap has a reddish, sweet-smelling interior, which insects mistake as a flower. A fly will land inside, and the flytrap will snap shut. The fly cannot escape, and the flytrap will consume the fly. Place your flytrap in areas popular fly areas, like your kitchen or near your door. Purchase Venus flytraps at most home supply stores or garden centers.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally conscious individual, possibly a sustainability advocate or a concerned citizen.

In fact, National Electrical Code (NEC() calls for it to be in conduit, when protection from physical damage is required. But it really isn't worth it.\n\n## It's a nightmare to pull\nNM (Romex) is already solid wire except in the large sizes, and now you have 3-4 wires bound together. You are trying to pull this around maybe 14\" radius elbows, and if the NM gets twists in it (it always does), it really drags in those places. It's just a stiff, miserable pull - enough to \"put you off conduit forever\" - which is a shame, because conduit is wonderful when using easy-to-pull stranded wire.\n\nPulling this stiff cable increases the risk of damaging the cable. What's more, \"cable in conduit\" is often a newbie who chooses cable simply because he is unaware that wire comes in any other forms. Which leads to more risk of damage still.\n\n## It requires ridiculously large conduit\nYou still have to calculate and respect conduit fill rules, and those are very punishing toward cable. Most cable is oblong, and the rules say you use the largest dimension and treat it as a circular wire of that dimension.\n\n* For a single \"wire\", you are allowed 53% conduit fill. That means the conduit ID must be at least 137% of the large cross-section of the cable. That's not so bad, but...\n* For two \"wires\", you're only allowed 31% fill. That's to protect the wires from binding. That means the conduit ID must be at least 2.54 times the cable large dimension.\n* For three \"wires\", you're allowed 40% fill. That means the conduit must be at least 2.74 times the cable width (at 3 wires), larger for more wires.\n\nFor instance, someone wanted to squeeze three #6 cables through a 1\" conduit. Now this is \"easy peasy\" with 6 individual #6 THHN wires and 3 bare #10 grounds. However, with three #6 UF cables, the conduit size needed to be 3\" instead of 1\".

They are a great project for school children to do while learning about different cultures throughout history. They are also a great project to do on a rainy day or over summer vacation. You can make paper mosaic masterpieces to frame and hang. You can also make paper mosaic masks to wear!\n\n## Make a simple paper mosaic\n\n1. Get some sheets of paper in different colors. Construction paper is the most popular, but you can also use scrapbook paper, paint chips, magazine pages, or even cereal boxes! What colors you need depends on your design. You don't have to use all of the colors of the rainbow. You could just use different shades of the same color, such as: light blue, medium blue, and dark blue.\n2. Cut the paper into small pieces to make your tiles. The pieces should be small, about the size of your thumbnail. You can make squares, rectangles, triangles, or even thin strips. The pieces don't have to be the same size. In fact, try to cut some smaller ones too. This way, you can fit them into tight corners. Sort your shapes by color and put them into small piles or cups. This will make it easier to find the color you need.\n3. Start gluing the pieces of paper to the outline of a shape. Lightly draw a simple shape on a sheet of paper, which will be the outline for your mosaic. When you start gluing the pieces on it, leave a small gap between each one. You can apply the glue directly to the sheet of paper, or you can apply it to the back of your tile instead. If you are using irregular shapes, including triangles, make sure that the straightest edge is on the outside of the outline\u2014otherwise, your shape will look jagged. If you are using white school glue, apply it with a paintbrush. This will keep things less messy. If you are applying the glue directly to the paper, work only in small sections at a time, or the glue will dry too fast.\n4. Glue the rest of your tiles to the inside of your shape. If your shape has designs on the inside, like spots on a butterfly wing, outline those designs first with more tiles before filling them in. Don't be afraid to cut some pieces down to help them fit! For a more professional touch, continue aligning the pieces along the outline, going smaller and smaller with each row until you reach the center.\n5. Consider filling in the background, if desired, using a contrasting color. This will make your work stand out. If you used different colors for your shape (this includes different shades of the same color), consider using just one color for the background. This will make your shape the focus. You can also leave the background blank.\n6. Set the mosaic out to dry. If you'd like to make your mosaic last longer, coat it with an acrylic sealer or a brush-on decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Let it dry before moving on.\n7. Finished.\n\n\n## Make a paper mosaic mask\n\n1. Draw a large oval or rectangle on a sheet of black paper. The shape needs to be just a little bit larger than your head. Don't cut anything out yet. Use poster paper, construction paper, or cardstock for this.\n2. Draw some shapes for the eyes, nose, and mouth. You will be cutting the eyes out, so figure out where your eyes will be when you put the mask on, and place them accordingly. Keep the nose and moth simple; you will be filling them in with tiles. A triangle for the nose and a rectangle or sausage shape for the mouth would be perfect!\n3. Cut some colored paper into small tiles. You can use construction paper, scrapbook paper, or paint chips for this. The shapes can be squares, rectangles, triangles, or even a combination of all three. They can be different sizes, but try to make them no larger than your thumbnail. You will need at least two different colors for this: one color for the mask and a contrasting color for the nose and mouth. For a different look, paint your own paper, let it dry, then cut it out. Sort your shapes by color. This will make it easier to find the color you need.\n4. Start gluing your paper tiles to the edge of your mask. Leave a small gap between each tile, and make sure that it doesn't go past the edges of the paper shape. You can use a glue stick or white school glue. If you are using white school glue, apply it using a paint brush. This will make things less messy.\n5. Glue some more tiles to the inside edges of the nose and mouth. This way, your nose and mouth won't be too big. Remember to leave a slight gap between each tile. For a cleaner finish, align any straight edges with the outline, and keep pointy edges on the inside of the shape. Use your contrasting color(s) for this. It will help them stand out better.\n6. Outline the outside of the eyes with more tiles, if desired. Don't fill the eyes in. You will be cutting them out later. You can use the same color you will use for the inside of the mask, or you can use a contrasting color.\n7. Start filling in your mask with tiles. You can glue them down randomly, or you can follow the curves of the outlines as you work your way towards the center. Remember to leave slight gaps between each tile. Use your contrasting color for the nose and mouth.\n8. Let your mask dry. If you'd like to make your mask last longer, you can seal it with a clear, acrylic sealer or a brush-on decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Remember to let the mask dry after sealing it.\n9. Cut the mask and the eyes out. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you cut the eyes out. You can cut the mask itself out using a pair of scissors, but you will need a shape craft knife (such as an Xacto knife) to cut the eyes out.\n10.

{"conversations": ["How to deal with diagnosis of a rare chromosome disorder in a child?", "Most people have heard of Down syndrome. But there are hundreds of other chromosome disorders a child can have, many of which are diagnosed in only a few children, or may even be unique to that child.\n\n## Get information\n\n1. Learn about genetics. Most people have 46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. One pair is the sex chromosomes, which in males is usually XY and in females XX. The other 22 pairs, known as autosomes, are numbered by size, with chromosome 1 being the biggest. Each chromosome has a longer arm, called the q arm, and a shorter arm, called the p arm. Each arm has bands that are numbered, with the band closest to the middle (centromere) being numbered 11.1. Terminus (shortened to \"ter\") refers to a tip of a chromosome. A \"terminal\" chromosome disorder is not fatal; it just involves the terminus. Learn about the types of changes. Nullisomy means that there are zero copies of a chromosome. Deletion/monosomy means that there is only one copy of the chromosome or piece of chromosome. Duplication/trisomy means that there are 3 copies. Tetrasomy and pentasomy refer to 4 and 5 copies, respectively. Translocations are when chromosomes swap material. If it is balanced, this means the same number of copies of material is present, but they are arranged differently - for example they have part of 3q on 2q and part of 2q on 3q, but it all adds up to the same thing. If it is unbalanced, the child has trisomy and/or monosomy for some part of the involved chromosomes. Very often, an unbalanced translocation is inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation, but it can also occur as a new mutation, which is called 'de novo'. For example, they may have part of 2q missing and part of 3q in its place, causing partial monosomy of 2q and partial trisomy of 3q. In an unbalanced translocation, the abnormal chromosome is called the derivative chromosome, or der for short. So they may write t(2;3)der(2) to indicate the child has the 2 with chromosome 3 material instead of the 3 with chromosome 2 material.\n2. Find medical information on your child's condition. There may not be much out there, but find what you can, because it can give you an idea what to expect for your child. Be careful to pay attention to what specific chromosome region is affected, including what bands are involved - even though they both have 22q deletion, kids with 22q11 deletion have a totally different syndrome from 22q13 deletion. Also keep in mind duplication/trisomy versus deletion/monosomy, because these are genetic opposites. When reading medical case studies, remember that they focus on the negative. You're probably not going to hear the doctor talk about how sweet and caring the child is, or how much their parents feel lucky for knowing them, because it's not medically relevant. You will learn about some of the health problems your kid could face.\n3. See if parents have written about your child's condition. Depending on how rare the condition is, there may be other parents out there who have written about what it is like to raise a child who has it.\n4. Look for adults with your child's condition. Many adults with genetic disabilities are able to use computers when they become adults. Do any of them have blogs or social media accounts? They may be able to offer good advice. Here are some benefits of learning from adults with disabilities:\n\t* They can tell you about the parenting strategies that did and didn't help. They may be able to offer detailed advice about your child. Watching them can help you envision what your child's life will be like someday.\n\n\n## Cop\n\n1. Don't assume the worst. Many doctors, when they don't know the prognosis for a condition, will act like it's more severe than it really is. Even parents of kids with very mild chromosome disorders have been told their child will never walk or talk and/or will die in infancy. If your child has a rare syndrome, take dire prognoses with a grain of salt.\n2. Recognize that infancy is the worst time. For many chromosomal conditions, the first year or two of life are the hardest, as caregivers and healthcare providers try to figure out the child's needs. It won't always be this bad, and it's likely to get easier. If you've been told that your child may die, recognize that extreme early death usually happens in the first 3 years of life, or not at all. If your child is fine at age 4, they'll probably be fine at age 24 and age 44.\n3. Give yourself time to process. You may feel a range of emotions as you realize that your child's life will look different than you thought it would. This is normal. Don't expect yourself to adjust immediately.\n4. Tell other people how they can support you. People around you may want to help, but not know what they can do. Let them know what your family needs, and give them the opportunity to help. \"Between all the doctor appointments, we barely have time to cook. It would be really nice to have someone prepare a meal or maybe invite us for dinner once in a while.\" \"We could really use a babysitter on weekends.\" \"We're so busy for with the baby that the kids can feel left out. If they could go to your house to play with your kids sometimes, it might help cheer them up.\" \"I'm really worried about the upcoming surgery. My wife can't be there due to her conference. It would really help to have someone there with me.\"\n5. Make peace with the fact that life will be different. Your child is going to learn differently, behave differently, and show you how much they love you differently. Sometimes it will be harder, but there will also be beautiful parts. Remember that not every quirk is a deficit. Some differences are positives, and others are neither good nor bad. It's okay for your child to be unique.\n6. Take time for yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup, and you can't help your child much if you're physically and emotionally exhausted. Try to set aside a little \"me time\" each day, even if it's only 5 minutes. Ask yourself \"What would help me feel better right now?\" Could it be a shower? A cup of tea? A hug? Try to get it.\n\n\n## Move forward\n\n1. Seek out parent support groups. If you can find other parents of kids with the same or overlapping chromosome disorders, great, but even parents of kids with completely different conditions can be a great source of support. UNIQUE has leaflets on many rare conditions.\n2. Get therapy early. Early intervention is important. As soon as your child is medically stable, sign them up for physical, occupational and/or speech therapy - even if they are still a tiny baby. This will help them reach their full potential. Although very few kids with chromosome disorders are so affected that they can't walk or talk, most have some degree of cognitive or learning disability. The more they can do for themselves, the less support they will need from others in adulthood. Take notes during therapy and ask for activities that you can do at home. Bad therapists do exist. If a therapist tells you to be cruel or punitive towards your child, find a new therapist. Childhood should be fun, not scary. You don't want your child to gain an anxiety disorder along with their new skills.\n3. Make time for your child's siblings, if there are any. At times, they may feel left out, especially if you're busy taking care of your disabled child's needs. Try to spend quality time with each of your children every day. If you don't spend time with a child on one day, try to make up for it during the weekend.\n4. Celebrate your child! Your child is different, and they have their own special combination of traits that make them who they are. Love them for who they are, and treasure the good moments. Some conditions, such as Williams syndrome, include positive aspects. Let go of the idea of the child you could have had, and focus on the real child you have right now. They need your love.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned parent or caregiver of a child recently diagnosed with a rare chromosome disorder.

Meanwhile, globally environment stays balanced, and depleted spots are replenished from outside - slowly healing the damage.

{"conversations": ["How to kill a fly?", "Flies can be annoying pests, especially inside your home. If you can\u2019t remove the flies humanely, you may want to kill them. Use a flyswatter for an easy way to kill a few lone flies. Try using sprays to get rid of numerous flies. You can also kill flies with bait and traps, like fly tape, DIY traps, or Venus fly traps. Eliminating flies can be done quickly, easily, and cheaply, whether you have a single fly or dozens to remove.\n\n## Use a flyswatter\n\n1. Wait for the fly to land. Keep your eye on the fly until it lands, then get ready to make your move. Approach the fly silently and slowly so it doesn't fly away. If you don\u2019t have a flyswatter, you can use other objects with a flat surface, like a newspaper, shoe, or book.\n2. Swat the fly with a quick, downward motion. Raise your flyswatter above your head, and bring it down over the fly in a single, strong move. You are crushing the fly between your flyswatter and a hard surface. If you miss the fly the first time, wait for it to land and swat again.\n3. Wipe up the fly and clean off your flyswatter. Rinse the flyswatter in soap and water, and use a tissue or paper towel to wipe up the mess. Make sure to wash your hands! You can also disinfect with a cleaning solution to prevent spreading any germs.\n4. Try using an electric flyswatter for an easier, efficient option. Electric flyswatters are devices that lure in flies with a light and kill them upon contact. Stand near the fly with your electric flyswatter to kill it effortlessly and quickly. Be sure to read over instructions carefully before use. Avoid touching the racket area, and always let the flyswatter fully cool down before storing it.\n\n\n## Spray the fly\n\n1. Choose from either chemical sprays, household cleaners, or hairspray. Chemical sprays kill flies instantly upon contact, though they contain harsh chemicals. You can also spray the flies with household cleaners, like Windex or Formula 409, or with an aerosol like hairspray. All of these sprays will help you kill a fly. Purchase chemical fly sprays at home supply stores. Look for brands like Hot Shot and Raid. Use spray if you want to remove many flies very quickly. Chemical sprays will kill them the fastest, though they have harmful chemicals. Household cleaners are a cheaper alternative, and you likely have them at home already.\n2. Spray the air near the fly thoroughly. Spray the fly while it is in the air or when the fly lands. Hold in the trigger to release the spray, and spray directly into the air around the fly. You want to saturate the fly in the spray. If you are using chemical sprays, the fly will die instantly. If you are using household cleaners or hairspray, the spray will coat the fly's wings, making it impossible to fly. The fly will still die, just not as quickly as with chemicals.\n3. Leave the room after you spray any hazardous chemical. The chemicals contained in most fly sprays are toxic and lethal. Household cleaners also use chemicals, though not quite as toxic. Avoid inhaling these chemicals by leaving the room immediately after you spray. Leave the room for both chemical sprays and household cleaners. If you have pets or children, they should also avoid the room until the chemicals have settled. You can wait about an hour before reentering the room, so the chemicals can dissipate. This will depend on how ventilated your room is and how much chemical you spray. It is safe to come back into the room when you no longer smell the chemicals.\n4. Dispose of the dead fly and wash your hands. Scoop up the dead flies with a paper towel or tissue, and throw them in the trash can. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water! If you killed multiple flies, throw them all away before you wash your hands.\n\n\n## Remove fly with trap\n\n1. Hang fly paper in areas with many flies for a cheap and easy option. Fly papers, or fly ribbons, are strips of paper coated in a sticky attractant. Flies approach the paper because they are attracted to the smell, and they get stuck to the paper and die. You can hang fly paper near your entrances, above your windows, or next to your trash can, for example. Fly paper can be hung up indoors or outdoors. Replace your fly paper after you collect a handful of dead flies.\n2. Make your own trap for a cost effective solution. You can make your own trap with sugar water, a jar, and a paper cone. Cut a small hole around the point of the paper cone. Pour 1 part sugar and 2 parts water into the jar, and place the cone upside down inside the jar. The flies will be attracted to the sweet smell, and once they are inside, they will get stuck and drown in the liquid. You can add a piece of cut fruit to the jar to tempt the flies further. Try a piece of apple. You can also add a mix of sugar and water to a plastic bottle instead of a jar.\n3. Set out a Venus flytrap for a natural, hands-off option. Venus flytraps are carnivorous plants that feed on insects. The flytrap has a reddish, sweet-smelling interior, which insects mistake as a flower. A fly will land inside, and the flytrap will snap shut. The fly cannot escape, and the flytrap will consume the fly. Place your flytrap in areas popular fly areas, like your kitchen or near your door. Purchase Venus flytraps at most home supply stores or garden centers.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally conscious individual, possibly a sustainability advocate or a concerned citizen.

O can be anywhere on the line segment, including at either end point (A or B). For convenience, let's put O somewhere near the middle of AB. The line segment could now be referred to as AOB.\n3. Grab a compass. Open the compass to a radius a little shorter than either AO or OB. Now place the compass point at O. Strike short arcs through AB on either side of O.

Which is it really?", "strong/weak can be thought of in relation to how the compiler, if applicable, handles typing.\n\n* Weakly typed means the compiler, if applicable, doesn't enforce correct typing.  Without implicit compiler interjection, the instruction will error during run-time.\n```\"12345\" * 1 === 12345  // string * number => number\n```\nStrongly typed means there is a compiler, and it wants you an explicit cast from string to integer.\n```(int) \"12345\" * 1 === 12345\n```\nIn either case, some compiler's features can implicitly alter the instruction during compile-time to do conversions for you, if it can determine that is the right thing to do.\nThus far, JavaScript can be categorized as Not-Strongly-Typed.  That either means it's weakly-typed or un-typed.\n\ndynamic/static can be thought of in relation to how the language instructions manipulate types.\n\n* Dynamically typed means the value's type is enforced, but the variable simply represents any value of any type.\n```x = 12345;    // number\nx = \"string\"; // string\nx = { key: \"value\" }; // object\ny = 123 + x; // error or implicit conversion must take place.\n```\nStatically typed means the variable type is strongly enforced, and the value type is less-so enforced.\n```int x = 12345; // binds x to the type int\nx = \"string\";  // too late, x is an integer - error\nstring y = 123; // error or implicit conversion must take place.\n```\nThus far, JavaScript can be categorized as Not-Statically-Typed.  Also, it appears to be Dynamically Typed, if typed at all.  So we need to see what Typing means.\n\nTyped means that the language distinguishes between different types such as string, number, boolean, object, array, null, undefined and so on. Also each operation is bound to specific types. So you cannot divide an integer by a string.\n```    2 / \"blah\"  // produces NaN\n```\nUntyped means the operation of dividing integer by string would result in treating the first four bytes of string as integer.  This is because Untyped operations take place directly on bits, there are no types to observe.  The outcome will be something quite unexpected:\n```    2 / \"blah\"  // will be treated as  2 / 1500275048\n```\nSince JavaScript behaves according to the definition of being Typed, it must be.  And therefore it must be Dynamically Typed, and Weakly Typed.\nIf anybody claims JavaScript is Untyped, it is merely for academic theory, not for practical application."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A software developer or computer science student with a strong interest in programming languages, particularly JavaScript.

{"conversations": ["How to make your linkedin profile stand out?", "LinkedIn has become a key tool for many recruiters to search for qualified candidates and for job seekers to make the right connections when seeking a job. The site allows each person to create a profile that can serve at as an online resume and minimal portfolio. You can make your LinkedIn profile stand out by ensuring that the basics of your profile are rock solid, and then going the extra mile to make it exemplary.\n\n## Start with the basics\n\n1. Add a professional profile picture to catch the eye of recruiters. Your profile picture must be professional in order to give a good first impression. If you have use a profile picture that is inappropriate or silly, recruiters will probably remove you from their candidate list immediately. When choosing a profile picture, remember to choose one that:\n\t* Does not include anyone else but you. This reduces confusion regarding who the profile is about and draws all the focus to you. Is just of your head and shoulders. Your profile picture is a small picture and will show your face better if you limit it's scope to just your head and shoulders. Shows you wearing professional business attire. LinkedIn is a professional site. Wearing business attire in your picture is highly recommended. This includes a nice collared shirt and a suit jacket if you wish (for both men and women) or an unrevealing blouse for women. Is in front of a solid background. Solid backgrounds allow the focus to be on you and not what is going on behind you. Has a smile. A smile can make you seem more approachable to those who don't know you. Is preferably taken by someone else. It is OK if it is not done by a professional, but definitely no selfies.\n2. Write an eye-catching headline to draw readers in. Headlines are automatically filled with your most recent job title after you add your experience. These can be boring, and you should consider changing your headline to something more unique. To make yourself stand out, edit your headline to tell the reader who you are and what you are an expert in. For example, \u201cOperations Executive\", \"Performance Driven, Airline Industry Expert\u201d.\n3. Customize your URL to brand yourself. Customizing your URL allows you to reference your LinkedIn page easily in your resume or on business cards and other documents. It should remain simple, with the best kind of URL including just your first and last name with no spaces or special characters. For example, www.linkedin.com/in/firstlastname.\n4. Provide an outstanding summary to highlight your talents. Writing a LinkedIn summary is much like writing a professional biography. It should be brief, yet comprehensive enough to give the reader an overview of your career thus far. Also, it should be well-written and engaging to entice them to read through your profile further and accept or request to connect with you. While writing a summary, remember to include the following:\n\t* Tell your story in the first person. This means using the words I, my and mine to make your summary more conversational and easy to read. Explain your expertise and interests. Use examples to show your value to potential clients and future employers. Highlight your key accomplishments. If you have made some great achievements in your career, take the time to list these in your summary. For example, Top Sales Award Winner. State a call to action. Explain what you are looking for while making connections on LinkedIn. For example, \u201copen to new opportunities\u201d, \u201clooking to make mutually beneficial connections\u201d or \u201ccontact me if I can be assistance to you\u201d.\n5. List each job you have held with a summary of tasks to provide detail. As with your resume, list all the jobs you have held. The difference between a LinkedIn profile and a resume is that it is acceptable to add any and all jobs to your experience section, rather than limiting yourself to what is most relevant to the particular job you are applying for, as with a resume. Also, you are also not limited to the 10 year rule as you would be on a resume. Therefore, feel free to list any job you have ever held in your career. Add a brief summary of the purpose of your job and the major tasks you have completed. Bullet key accomplishments. As with a resume, you want to highlight your strengths and accomplishments to show you were successful at your job. For example, \u201cNegotiated a $1.5M sale to increase profit margins by 25%\u201d.\n6. Add all relevant skills to your profile. The skills section of a LinkedIn profile can hold up to 50 skills. It is recommended for you to use all 50 of these slots to provide a full look at what you are capable of. This section is very easy to use because it populates suggestions as you are typing and allows you to click on these for a quick listing. For example, while typing \u201cCoaching\u201d it may also populate \u201cBusiness Coaching, Job Coaching and Staff Coaching\u201d.\n\n\n## Add support material\n\n1. Know your audience to target your profile's contents. Given your career path and the type of people you are trying to attract with your LinkedIn profile, you should know what readers will be looking for and you can give the audience what they want. For example, if you are a writer, your audience will be looking for your creativity and to remain engaged throughout your profile by your choice of words and correct grammar. If, however, you are a sales representative, your audience will be looking for your stats and your ability to sell yourself throughout your profile.\n2. Use concise and effective wording to create impact. Just as in a resume, you must keep your sentences concise (brief) and powerful by using effective wording to get your point across. This means using action words such as: drove, reduced, increased, created, initiated, trained, developed, won, and acquired.\n3. Use keywords to enhance your ranking in search results. Using keywords in your profile is extremely important because these keywords will be used by others who are looking to make connections. The more keywords you add that are related to your experience and field of interest, the higher your profile will rank when searched. For example if a recruiter is looking for someone with \u201csales and lead generation\u201d experience they will add these keywords to the search field. To find the best keywords for you to use, browse job openings for various companies and pick out common words and phrases. If you have experience in these areas, use these keywords in your profile. If you have the experience but do not use the keywords, your profile will not appear in the proper search results.\n4. Add relevant presentations, videos and other files to show your expertise. LinkedIn allows you to get creative with your profile. For each job or education listed, you have the option to upload a document or file to further illustrate your experience. Adding these types of files is great for someone who produces work of a visual nature. For example, professional presentations, photographs, videos, ads and graphics. Be sure to add only files that are relevant to your personal experience and accomplishments, and not something about your company or school. For example, do not add a recruiting video about the company you work for.\n5. Ask for recommendations. Having recommendations in your LinkedIn profile is important, because instead of you telling the reader how great you are, they get a chance to hear it from someone else who has worked with you. Once you have made connections with those who you believe will write you a good recommendation, send them a message by clicking on the \u201cAsk to be recommended\u201d link under your profile edit page.\n6. Use special characters. You can use special characters to make your profile stand out by creating bullet points or breaking up a section and creating lines. However, not all symbols are accepted and translated into LinkedIn.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A job seeker, career professional, or entrepreneur who is looking to enhance their online presence and attract potential employers or clients.

But the second approach has a nice advantage: it replaces an O(n) negation of the array with an O(1) slice. If you're working with small arrays inside loops then you may get some performance gains from avoiding that negation, and if you're working with huge arrays then you can save on memory usage because the negation creates a copy of the entire array.\n\nNote that these methods do not always give equivalent results: if a stable sort implementation is requested to argsort, e.g. by passing the keyword argument kind='mergesort', then the first strategy will preserve the sorting stability, but the second strategy will break stability (i.e. the positions of equal items will get reversed)."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A data analyst, programmer, or computer science student who is working with NumPy arrays and is seeking to understand the usage of the `argsort` function in Python.

{"conversations": ["How to prevent an electrical fire during the holidays?", "During the holidays, it is common for people to decorate the inside and outside of their home with lighting, and other types of electrical accessories. Although most decorations are manufactured to withstand the holiday season, improper and unsafe usage can increase your chances of experiencing an electrical fire. However, with the proper safety measures, you can prevent electrical fires from occurring, and keep both your home and your family safe. Use this article as your guide for learning how to prevent an electrical fire from occurring during the holiday season.\n\n## General electrical fire prevention\n\n1. Use holiday decorations that have been approved for safety by national laboratories. Decoration packaging will contain seals or labels that indicate the product is safe to use in your home. Using decorations that lack a safety approval may be hazardous, and can trigger an electrical fire.\n2. Inspect the physical condition of all electrical decorations before use. Electrical decorations should not display any loose or frayed wires, loose or cracked bulbs, or any other physical faults. If these features are present, avoid using the decorations to prevent an electrical fire.\n3. Refrain from plugging multiple electrical decorations into one specific outlet. Some outlets cannot support multiple connections, and may become overloaded and trigger an electrical fire as a result. Plug your decorations into multiple outlets, and read the instructions included with your decorations to determine the safest method for use.\n4. Replace bulbs in light strings with those of the same wattage, when applicable. If you replace a bulb with a higher wattage than is required, you can potentially cause the entire string of lights to overheat and start a fire.\n5. Turn off or unplug all electrical decorations when leaving the house or going to sleep. Leaving your decorations unsupervised means that nobody is around to notice any fire that might start. Lights and other electrical components become overheated due to being left on for an extended period of time.\n\n\n## Outdoor electrical fire prevention\n\n1. Only use lights and electrical decorations that are approved for outdoor use. Outdoor lights and decorations are often manufactured to withstand rain, snow, and other harsh elements. Using decorations that are approved for indoor-use only may trigger an electrical fire when coming into contact with certain elements. Thoroughly read and inspect all decoration packaging to verify that the decorations are safe to use outdoors.\n2. Use a ladder made from wood, fiberglass, or plastic instead of metal. Using a ladder made from materials other than metal will reduce your risk of becoming shocked, or starting an electrical fire.\n3. Keep all extension cords and strings of lights suspended up and away from standing water and snow. If extension cords and wiring come into contact with standing water, they can trigger an electrical fire or cause electrocution.\n4. Place decorations away from major power lines and high-voltage areas. This can prevent electrocution and an electrical fire from starting in the event you accidentally come into contact with a high-voltage power line.\n\n\n## Indoor electrical fire prevention\n\n1. Buy fresh, green trees instead of trees that are dry and losing pine needles. Fresh trees are less flammable and less likely to ignite; whereas dry trees can catch fire when they come into contact with very warm or hot lights. Purchase a fire-resistant or flame-retardant tree if you decide on an artificial tree instead of a live tree.\n2. Place your tree in a position at least 3 feet (0.91 m) (90cm) away from heat sources. Heat sources such as radiators, space heaters, fireplaces, and heat vents can often cause your tree and its electrical decorations to catch fire.\n3. Water your tree on a daily basis or as needed to keep it fresh. By maintaining the freshness of your tree throughout the holiday season, you are reducing the risk of an electrical fire that could be caused by decorations igniting a dry tree.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned homeowner or renter who is seeking practical advice to ensure the safety of their household during the holiday season.

It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries. And it creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production.\nSo in most cases, protecting the environment and promoting economic growth go hand-in-hand.

{"conversations": ["How to diagnose adrenal gland disease in pomeranians?", "Pomeranians are a breed that are especially prone to baldness problems. While your dog may have other adrenal gland diseases, such as Cushing's Disease or Addison's Disease, Alopecia X is the most common condition that affects Pomeranians. Adrenal gland disease goes by a variety of names, such as Alopecia X, Black Skin Disease, and Growth Hormone Responsive Dermatosis, among others. Adrenal gland disease is a puzzling condition, and vets are not really sure of the cause. There are ways to diagnose if your dog has this condition.\n\n## Identify symptoms\n\n1. Watch for odd patches of fur. One of the first signs of adrenal gland disease is patches of hair that look different than the rest of the coat. These patches will contain hair that is short and oddly textured, like wool.\n2. Look for symmetrical hair loss. When a dog has adrenal gland disease, the Pomeranian sheds her fur right down to the skin and the fur doesn't regrow. The fur loss is in a symmetrical pattern so the hair loss on the left of the body mirrors that on the right. Hair loss usually occurs on the trunk and back thighs, and not on the head or front legs.\n3. Watch for dark patches of skin. When the dog loses her hair, the exposed skin often becomes hyperpigmented. This means that the skin changes from a regular pink or beige color into a dark brown or black color. Additionally, the skin is often dry and scaly.\n4. Be alert for any lack of hair growth. Another way you know your Pomeranian has this condition is that hair does not regrow after it has been clipped or shaved.\n5. Know that this condition can affect any dog. Pomeranians of any age or sex can be affected. This means that through your dog\u2019s entire life, you need to watch for signs of this condition. Although a dog can get this condition any time, the dog is healthy otherwise even if she does start to show the symptoms.\n\n\n## Diagnose the disease\n\n1. Be aware of an unspecific diagnosis. The problem with diagnosing adrenal gland disease is that vets aren't sure why it occurs in the first place. This makes it impossible to develop a single test that gives a definitive answer as whether baldness is specifically due adrenal gland disease or some other problem.\n2. Take your dog to the vet. The vet has to rule out all other problems which could cause hair loss. This means conducting an extensive array of tests searching for specific conditions, which can then be confirmed or crossed off the list. Once all these tests are done, and if they all come back negative, then the condition is likely to be adrenal gland disease. Adrenal gland disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, which means all other possible causes of hair loss have to be crossed off the list in order to diagnose the condition. Many of the symptoms of adrenal gland disease, like hair loss, can be due to more serious diseases, such as Cushing's Disease. Alopecia X is not life threatening, but other adrenal gland diseases can be serious if left untreated. This is why taking your dog to the vet is so important.\n3. Have multiple tests run. The vet may want to run some or all of the following tests, which will prove or rule out other conditions which may be similar to adrenal gland disease. The tests include:\n\t* Thyroid blood test\n\t* Adrenal hormone test\n\t* A urinalysis\n\t* Abdominal ultrasound\n\t* Skin scrapes\n\t* Skin biopsy\n\t* Screening blood tests\n4. Notice the effects of this disease. When your dog gets this condition, know that it is a cosmetic condition. Your dog will not be in any pain. If your vet has ruled out any other underlying condition, then your dog can live a happy life with the condition.\n5. Find the proper treatment. Most treatments for Alopecia X focus on helping the dog grow the coat back, but they are trial and error. Many adrenal gland problems are caused by hormonal imbalances, so dogs may be spayed or neutered. If this is not an option, melatonin therapy may be suggested. Other treatment options may be available if these don't work. However, they can cause adverse reactions, so the adverse health effects need to be considered next to the cosmetic benefits.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A veterinarian or a pet owner with a Pomeranian who is concerned about their pet's health.

{"conversations": ["Windows in its earliest days was simply a shell that ran on top of MS-DOS, which means that Windows 3.1 itself was actually just a standard MS-DOS application like any other.\nYet, MS-DOS is not a multitasking operating system, and at the same time, Windows applications were compiled native-code binaries that ran without any form of managed environment. So, how exactly was multitasking of Windows binaries achieved if Windows 3.1 was simply a regular old MS-DOS program itself? Are there any old technical documents still floating around that describe the early Windows architecture internally?", "For Win16 programs, Windows implemented co-operative multitasking. Its implementation was based upon the &quot;message loop&quot; architecture of every Windows program.\n\nThe duty of every program was to endlessly run in a loop in which a call to the ```GetMessage``` function was performed. This function call looks whether a message to this process is in the queue. If there is one, it is retrieved (```GetMessage```), optionally translated (```TranslateMessage```, done to convert keyboard shortcuts into menu actions) and finally, passed to the window procedure (```DispatchMessage```).\n\nIf there is no message available in the queue, Windows suspends the current task and gives the CPU to another task. This task will try to retrieve a message from its queue as well, yielding the CPU to another task if no message is present and so on.\n\nIf a program needed to perform background tasks while there were no pending messages in its queue, it would call ```PeekMessage``` instead of ```GetMessage```. This didn't make the task relinquish the CPU, as ```PeekMessage``` would immediately return to the caller task to inform it whether a message is available or not. This was used to time-multiplex message processing with another time-consuming task (think of a 3D program rendering but letting the user cancel that render by pressing a &quot;Cancel&quot; button).\n\nIf this time-consuming task was actually very time-consuming, a well-behaved program should call the ```Yield``` function from time to time, to relinquish the CPU and let other tasks run. A badly-behaved program could easily hog the CPU by not retrieving messages too often or by spending too much time in a window procedure function.\n\nThe situation was quite different for MS-DOS boxes. They ran using the V8086 mode of the 80386 (if Windows was running in enhanced mode). Windows-aware programs ran in the so-called System VM (Virtual Machine 1). DOS boxes ran from VM 2 upwards.

And the taboo can, in fact, be detrimental, as it is here.\n\nAround the time of the industrial revolution, you were not allowed to talk about your wages. You could be fired if you did.

{"conversations": ["How to buy school supplies?", "Shopping for school supplies can be stressful for both the seasoned shopper and the beginner. Working parents or guardians have to fight the crowds that gather on weekends or after the end of the workday. Even worse, the cost of school supplies steadily increases every year, costing families an average of just under $100 in 2015. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to stress out or go bankrupt. By spacing out your purchases and practicing a few money-saving hacks, you can survive the back-to-school madness.\n\n## Buy basic supply\n\n1. Get a list from your child\u2019s school. Don\u2019t rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isn\u2019t available on the school\u2019s website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites.\n2. Know the difference between requests and requirements. Before you panic over the long supply list on the school\u2019s website, realize that many of the items are merely requests. One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.\n3. Purchase writing supplies. Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper. Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art. Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but it\u2019s always a good idea to check the supply list in case your child\u2019s teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners. Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.\n4. Buy folders. Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc. ).\n5. Purchase a day planner. Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.\n6. Buy art supplies. Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.\n7. Purchase personal supplies. Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack. Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.\n8. Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag. Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time. However, textbooks haven\u2019t gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.\n\n\n## Shop for electronics\n\n1. Buy a calculator. High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:\n\t* Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30. Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.\n2. Purchase a computer. High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list. Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget.\n3. Buy external storage. Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.\n\n\n## Save money\n\n1. Sort out what you already have. Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldn\u2019t mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s). Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt. Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.\n2. Stick to basics and generics. Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Don\u2019t worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs.\n3. Take advantage of discounts. Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back. Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.\n4. Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks. Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.\n5. Buy refurbished. Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost. However, you should do your homework first. Only buy refurbished products from trusted retailers like Apple or Best Buy, which offer warranties and free repairs on known issues.\n6. Buy a little at a time throughout the year. There\u2019s no rule that you have to buy school supplies in July and August. Each time you\u2019re shopping for groceries or picking up a prescription, stop by the school supply aisle to look for unannounced discounts on common required supplies.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally-conscious small business owner or manager seeking practical strategies to minimize their carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable future.

The main objection was to the boardgame we were publishing, The Battle of Five Armies. The author of that game had given us a letter from his attorney claiming the work was grandfathered because it was published after the copyrights for JRRT's works had lapsed and before any renewals were made. The action also demanded we remove balrog, dragon, dwarf, elf, ent, goblin, hobbit, orc, and warg from the D&D game. Although only balrog and warg were unique names we agreed to hobbit as well, kept the rest, of course. The boardgame was dumped, and thus the suit was settled out of court at that.\n\nHalflings were originally called &quot;hobbits&quot; in the Dungeons & Dragons box set first released in 1974. Later printings changed this to &quot;halfling&quot;.\nAccording to The Acaeum, this change occurred between the fifth printing (Dec 1975 - Apr 1976) and sixth printing (1977), with the six printing being marked the Original Collector's Edition. However, Tim Kask has said that box sets were generally thrown together with whichever printings of the books were on hand, so the distinctions between printings are inexact. The Acaeum notes at least one box set shipped having the revised booklets but no Original Collector's Edition mark.\nDue to an oversight, a single reference to &quot;hobbit&quot; remained on page 6 of Men & Magic, which was fixed in the 2013 Deluxe reprint and PDF copies.\nAccording to Wikipedia, J.R.R. Tolkien sold the film, stage, and merchandising rights to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968, who sold them in turn to Saul Zaentz in 1976.

{"conversations": ["How to treat arthritis in horses?", "Arthritis is a painful joint problem that affects horses as well as humans. If your four-legged friend is suffering from the problem, supplements and medications can provide some relief from painful inflammation. Making lifestyle changes, like light exercise and farrier work, can also increase your horse\u2019s comfort and quality of life. Since arthritis is almost impossible to stop, it is important to keep in touch with a veterinarian for advice on continued treatment.\n\n## Make lifestyle change\n\n1. Consult your veterinarian. A vet will need to examine your horse and assess the factors that might be contributing to its arthritis, including age, diet, and activity level. This will help them determine the right medication and lifestyle changes to prescribe your horse. Your vet may take x-rays to assess the severity of your horse\u2019s arthritis and make further suggestions for treatment.\n2. Control the horse\u2019s weight. If your horse is overweight, this will put additional strain on its joints, worsening pain and discomfort. Help your horse lower its weight, if necessary, then feed it a nutritious but lean diet to keep its weight down. Keeping an older horse nourished can be difficult because their nutritional needs and ability to digest food may change. Always ask your vet for advice before making major changes in your horse\u2019s diet.\n3. Don\u2019t keep your horse confined to the stable. Arthritic horses will probably be reluctant or unable to move like they once did. Keeping them indoors, however, will actually make the problem worse. Provide a large pasture for them to roam and graze about to keep the joints moving and prevent the horse from getting too stiff.Regular light exercise, such as trail riding, will be good for your horse, and limit the effects of arthritis.\n4. Talk to your farrier. The condition of a horse\u2019s hooves and shoes are critical to its movement and comfort, and this is especially the case for one suffering from arthritis. Let your farrier know that the horse is having problems with arthritis, and they may make recommendations that will keep its hooves in good condition and make it more comfortable.\n\n\n## Try supplement and medications\n\n1. Give your horse feed supplements. A number of nutritional supplements are available, including glucosamine and hyaluronic acid. These can be given to your horse along with its food to help alleviate some of the symptoms of arthritis, like pain and stiffness. Look for feed supplements at a supply store, or ask your vet. Feed supplements are a simple option to try at first. However, they are not regulated, and they are not guaranteed to be effective. Ask your vet what they recommend for your horse based on the severity of your horse's issues\n2. Try injectable joint products. Some products, including polysulfated glycosaminoglycans (Adequan) and sodium hyaluronate (Legend) can be injected directly into the affected joint to give your horse some relief. A vet may also recommend injecting the joint with steroids or hyaluronic acid. These products can give immediate relief. In some cases, their benefits can last for months or years. Your vet will sterilize the area to be injected and inject the correct steroid and acid combination. Once you go down the road of injecting a joint, you will likely have to inject the same joint again in the future to keep your horse comfortable.\n3. Ask about joint projectants. Arthritis is caused by a combination of inflammation and degeneration (breaking down) at affected joints. In addition to the products that provide relief from painful inflammation, ones like glucosamine and chondroitin can help protect the joint itself from damage. Your vet can prescribe the right product for your horse.\n4. Supply pain relievers. Some products, including phenylbutazone and firocoxib, won\u2019t treat the joint itself, but will provide your horse with some general pain relief. Your vet will prescribe these for your horse if they believe the medicine will improve the horse\u2019s quality of life. Use painkillers as directed by your veterinarian. Giving pain medication more frequently than recommended or in too large a quantity can damage your horse\u2019s gastrointestinal tract and cause kidney or liver failure.\n5. Expect the issue to progress over time. Medications can definitely help a horse be more comfortable, and caring well for your horse can increase its quality of life. However, it is almost impossible to repair the damage caused by arthritis. Over time, problems caused by arthritis will increase, so it is important to stay in touch with your vet about continued treatment.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A horse owner or equine veterinarian with a keen interest in equine health and wellness.

{"conversations": ["Temperature conversion:\n$$273 + \\text{degree Celsius} = \\text{Kelvin}$$\nActually why is that $273$? How does one come up with this?", "One Celsius (or Kelvin) degree as a temperature difference was defined as 1/100 of the temperature difference between the freezing point of water and boiling point of water. These points are called 0 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C, respectively. The number 100 arose because we're used to numbers that are powers of ten because we use the base-ten system. The Celsius degree is \"one percent\" of the temperature difference.\n\nThere also exists the minimum temperature that one may achieve. In Kelvin degrees, it's sensible to call this minimum 0 K: that's a primary condition on the \"natural\" temperature scales such as the Kelvin scale. If one insists that one Kelvin degree is equally large as one Celsius degree as a unit of temperature difference, it just turns out that the melting point of ice has to be 273.15 K and the boiling point of water is 373.15 K. It's because the temperature difference between the boiling and freezing points is 2.7315 times smaller than the temperature difference between the minimum allowed temperature, the absolute zero, and the freezing point of water.\n\nThe value 2.7315 cannot be easily explained in simple words. It represents a specific characteristic related to water, a natural phenomenon that arises from the principles of quantum mechanics. To understand this value, extensive simulations are required to analyze the behavior of water molecules across a wide range of temperatures.

Also note that for the ideal gas, we have $pV=nRT$, so at a fixed pressure (or volume), the volume (or pressure) is proportional to $T$. We don't express pressures and volumes in terms of their logarithms, either, so it would be equally unnatural for the temperature.\n\nThe log scale is always a sort of \"policymaking issue\", making it easy for people to say simple numbers instead of powers of ten which are \"complicated constucts\" for most laymen. It's the only justification for decibels, pH, Richter scales, and other things: you just don't want the laymen to ever pronounce \"ten to the power of [a number]\", that's the only reason.

We have always been on the same page with each other whenever we correct bad behavior or instruct her on why a type of outburst is inappropriate. \nSo this begs the question, will she feel like we are always ganging up on her? If we are both constantly correcting and instructing in tandem, is that bad? Should one parent act as an advocate while the other is tough on the rules? Should there be a good cop and a bad cop?", "Classic good-cop-bad-cop is definitely wrong with a toddler because it involves a lot of lying. The bad cop threatens to beat the suspect up or otherwise do something cops are not allowed to do.

None of this is appropriate with your child.\n\nIt is advisory to give away any thoughts of an adversarial stance. You want your child to learn to be in control and not to tantrum. You want your child to comply with reasonable requests, whether that's putting on an item of clothing, helping to clean up, not hitting, or anything else. When your child can do those things, not only will you be happier but your child will too. You don't need to break their spirit, make them give up their resistance, force them to do what you want. You need to show them how to do the things everyone wants them to learn to do. Nobody is a bad cop in that. Nobody is a good cop. You can love your child while you're putting something out of their reach. You can smile and cuddle someone as part of letting them know they are not allowed to do a particular activity.

{"conversations": ["How to make a cat tree?", "Cats are natural climbers, and will happily crawl all over tall structures. A homemade cat tree will provide your kitty with hours of entertainment, and can be built at a fraction of the cost of cat trees available at a pet store. With some tools and dedication, you can make a customized cat tree based on your cat's personality!\n\n## Build a cat tree from wood and carpet\n\n1. Design your cat tree. Before purchasing materials or starting to build, you need a design plan, which you can sketch out on a piece of paper to determine your materials shopping list. There are several things to consider when designing your cat tree. First, consider your space limitations. Determine where your cat tree will be placed, and what size will fit well into that space. It's a good idea to take measurements to ensure your finished product will fit the space. You should also consider your cat's personality. If your cat likes to climb, consider building a tall cat tree with several perches. If your cat would like a private place to hide or sleep, consider building in a covered sleeping nook. Finally, you should keep your carpentry skills in mind. If you are relatively inexperienced with building things and using tools, keep your design simple so that you aren't overwhelmed. If you're at a loss for where to begin, there are several websites that have pictures of do-it-yourself cat trees you can use for inspiration, or even patterns for cat trees other people have made.\n2. Buy your materials. Use your design plan to determine which materials you will need. Plywood works well for horizontal platforms; dimensional lumber and cardboard or PVC pipe work well for vertical supports, and carpet is ideal for covering the wood. You may also need the following tools to assemble your tree:\n\t* A drill and some wood screws\n\t* An electric stapler\n\t* A table saw and a handsaw\n\t* A Hammer and nails\n\t* A carpet or utility knife\n\t* Wood glue or another powerful adhesive\n\t* If you want to create covered areas for your cat to perch, you may also want to pick up a concrete form tube. These heavy-duty cardboard tubes make great perches and tunnels for cats. These can also be cut lengthwise using a utility knife to create concave platforms or open-topped beds for your cat.\n3. Cut all materials to size. Using your plan as a guide, cut all the plywood and lumber sections to size. A simple hand saw works well for cutting dimensional lumber, while a handheld circular saw or table saw is better for cutting sheets of plywood. Sand rough edges if desired.\n4. Build the base of your cat tree. The tree needs a sturdy base, which should extend farther out from the center than any other platform or component of the tree in order to prevent tipping. To make the base, a good option is to cut 2 squares of plywood to size and glue them together for extra thickness. A 24\" (60 cm) square works well for a basic cat tree, but the taller your tree, the larger you'll want to make the base, to ensure it is sturdy.\n5. Cover the base in carpet. Before attaching any vertical supports, it's best to cover the base with carpet or a thick upholstery fabric. Cut the carpet to size, making it a few inches larger than the base on all sides. Then, wrap its edges over the edges of the plywood base, and staple it in place on the underside of the base with a staple gun. You may need to cut small notches in the carpet at the corners to make it fold neatly beneath the base.\n6. Attach the vertical supports to the base. The vertical supports that will hold up your platforms can be attached to the base with screws, nails, bolts or wood glue. Flip the base over so the carpeted side is face down. Then, drill holes through the underside of the base in the spots where you want the supports to be. Attach the supports by inserting screws or nails through the holes and driving them into the supports. You may want to cover the supports with carpet before attaching them, as this will be easier than doing it after they are already secured in place. To make your cat tree double as a scratching post, wrap one or more of the supports in sisal rope, securing each end with wire brads or staples, placed where they will be out view and won't be scratched by the cat. If you use staples, you may need to tap them down with a hammer to make sure they don't stick out too much.\n7. Attach the horizontal perches to the supports. The plywood perches can be attached using wood screws and/or gluing them to the tops of the vertical members. Wrap them in carpet or fabric after affixing them, so that the screws aren't visible through the carpet, and staple the carpet in place on the underside as you did with the base.\n8. Continue building according to your design. Continue to affix each component, referring back to your plan for measurements and placement. Adjustments to your design can be made as you go to account for stability issues, new ideas, or incorrect measurements.\n\n\n## Build a cat tree from a ladder\n\n1. Obtain a ladder. For this simple, unique cat tree, you'll need an old wooden ladder. Look around at garage sales, thrift furniture stores, and antique stores for one 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2 m) high. Choose an old-fashioned ladder that looks like an upside-down \"v\" with several steps on either side that are at matching levels. It's fine if the wood looks old, but make sure the foundation of the ladder isn't too rickety. You want to be certain your cat tree won't tip over and hurt your cat. Try to find a ladder that's around four feet tall. A very tall ladder my be less stable or too tall for your cat.\n2. Gather your supplies. The ladder is going to be the base of the tree, but you'll need to alter it a bit to make it more cat friendly. Gather these supplies:\n\t* A piece of plywood long and wide enough to rest on two rungs of the ladder at the same level. This will provide a platform for your cat. If you want more than one platform, you'll need more than one piece of plywood. A hammer and 2\" nails\n\t* Carpet\n\t* An electric staple gun\n\t* A piece of canvas, denim, or other sturdy fabric you can use to create a hammock between the two bottom rungs\n\t* A can of paint (optional)\n\t* A toy that hangs from a piece of rope or string\n\t* Sisal rope to wrap around the legs of the ladder\n3. Sand and paint your ladder and wood pieces. Use fine-grain sandpaper to sand down the ladder and remove any jagged edges or splinters. Do the same to the pieces of plywood you bought. Paint the ladder and plywood pieces with a coat or two of paint, if you're using it. Let the paint dry completely. Use your imagination when it comes time to paint. You could just paint the ladder to match your existing decor. But you could also paint it brown and green to make it look like a tree, or use stencils to make designs up and down the sides. Instead of painting the platforms, you can make them more comfortable for you cat by covering them in carpet, attaching it to to the platforms after nailing them into place. Use your staple gun and affix the carpet with staples in the perimeter and in the center. Make sure they don't stick up from the platform, tapping them down with a hammer if necessary.\n4. Nail the plywood platforms to the ladder. Position the first piece of plywood so that it is lined up across two ladder rungs of equal height. Use the hammer and four nails to nail the plywood into the wooden rungs, placing one nail in each corner of the plywood. Make sure the platforms are very secure when you're finished nailing them down. You may wish to use more nails, or substitute wood screws for a firmer hold. If you have a second piece of plywood to create another level, use the same procedure to nail it down.\n5. Install the hammock. Many cats enjoy sleeping in hammocks. If you'd like to add one to your cat tree, measure and cut your piece of cloth so that its four corners stretch between the four legs of the ladder. Nail or staple a corner of the fabric to the inside of each leg, making sure that the nails are all at the exact same height. Be sure the fabric you use for the hammock is thick enough to hold the weight of your cat. You can double the fabric or hem the edges before nailing it down to make it sturdier. Fabric that stretches a little is ideal for cat hammocks. Make sure nails or staples do not protrude in such a way that your cat could be scratched or cut. Tap your staples with hammer if necessary. Instead of a hammock, you can also use a carpeted concrete form tube, fastened to the ladder by attaching it to two 2X4 pieces of lumber secured to the base of the ladder with bolts, nails, or screws, between the legs. This will make your cat tree less portable, but also sturdier.\n6. Wrap the ladder legs in rope. If you want the cat tree to double as a scratching post, you can wrap the bottom of the ladder legs in strong, coarse rope. Cut the rope in four pieces. Use staples to secure the end of the first piece of rope to the inside of the base of one of the legs. Wrap the leg tightly with rope, tapping it down with a hammer if necessary. Secure the other end with a staple, making sure it is away from any areas the cat is most likely to scratch often. Repeat with the other four legs. If you want to, you can cover the legs entirely with rope, from top to bottom, using a new piece of rope between each rung of the ladder. This will allow your cat access to a scratchable surface nearly anywhere on its new cat tree.\n7. Finish up. Hang the toy you bought from the top of the ladder, somewhere the cat will be able to reach it, so as to entice your cat to come and play. Add any other finishing touches you want to make your cat tree unique and fun for your cat.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A creative and environmentally-conscious individual who enjoys crafting and upcycling household items.

{"conversations": ["How to resolve complaints?", "When a customer has a grievance with a company, it is in the interests of both parties to come to a smooth and fast resolution. Whether you are the one making a complaint or the one designated to resolve customer service issues, you can make the process an easy one that will keep everybody happy.\n\n## Make a successful complaint against a company\n\n1. Determine what the exact problem is. A complaint can be a very minor matter (such as if you buy a shirt that has a tear in it) or a very significant--even criminal--matter (such as if you are defrauded out of a significant amount of money). Consider carefully what exactly your complaint entails. Some common reasons to make a complaint include:\n\t* Buying a defective product\n\t* Ordering a product that is not delivered in a timely fashion\n\t* Being charged the wrong price for a purchase\n\t* Having your credit card information stolen and used improperly\n2. Figure out what you want to achieve with your complaint. Depending on the severity of your complaint, you might wish to achieve very different goals. Ask yourself what would solutions would make you happy. You might also want to consider whether the company can take any action that would make you want to return as a customer. Keep your ideal goal in mind as you pursue your claim. Some possible solutions to a complaint include:\n\t* Getting a replacement product\n\t* Having your money partially or entirely refunded\n\t* Receiving store credit\n\t* Being paid restitution or damages\n3. Know your rights as a consumer. As a consumer, you have the right to be treated in a fair and above-board manner. Many municipalities and nations have laws that protect consumers from fraudulent behavior. Examine your consumer rights carefully to prepare yourself for a confrontation with the company. If you know your rights, you are less likely to be intimidated into withdrawing your complaint.\n4. Read your paperwork carefully. Many services and products involve a signed contract. This contract might include information about how grievances can be filed and about what grievances are legitimate. Make sure you understand clearly what you have signed your name to and what the company has agreed to. If you are uncertain whether a contract you have signed is legitimate or not, you might contact a consumer attorney who can help you navigate the legalese.\n5. Find the contact information for the appropriate employee at the company. Many companies have a department devoted to customer service. If you have a problem with a product, you will likely want to get in touch with that department. Other possibilities might include management, an Ombudsman (if you feel like you have been mistreated), or human resources (if you suffered abuse at the hands of an employee). Look through the company website or navigate their voicemail system to determine whom you should contact.\n6. Gather all relevant material and information. Before you make your complaint, make sure you have all the necessary paperwork and dates at your disposal. Many companies require a proof of purchase before exchanging or returning items, and you will want to have yours handy. If your transaction involved a transaction number, be sure you have that written down in a handy place. Things you might gather include:\n\t* A copy of your receipt\n\t* Your credit card slip\n\t* Your credit card bill with the relevant transaction on it\n\t* Your emailed transaction confirmation\n\t* The date and time of your transaction\n\t* Your warranty\n\t* The defective item\n7. Make copies of your paperwork. Before handing any documents over to the company, make sure that you have back-up copies safely stored at home. This is especially important for receipts and contracts: never give up your originals until your complaint is resolved. You should also document your phone calls: jot down the time you called, the people to whom you spoke, and the details of your conversation.\n8. Try a phone call or quick visit first. Especially for minor complaints, you can try to resolve your complaint with a quick phone call or visit to the appropriate employee. Many retail stores have a customer service desk you can visit, for example. If your complaint is small and does not involve potentially criminal activity on the part of the company, try to resolve the issue in this quick and easy way.\n9. Communicate your grievance clearly and succinctly. Be upfront, polite, but firm when you articulate your complaint to the customer service representative. Make sure that you detail exactly what your problem is, the date of your transaction, and how you envision the problem might be resolved. Try to avoid extreme emotions or oversharing at this stage: after all, you want the customer service representative to be on your side. For example, you might say:\n\t* \"I purchased this new phone last week. Unfortunately, the phone battery does not hold its charge. According to my warranty, I should receive a brand-new phone. Can you help me resolve this?\" \"I bought these earrings on October 19. I was told that they were hypoallergenic. However, they are still causing an allergic reaction. I am hoping to exchange them for actually hypoallergenic earrings. I have kept my receipt and credit card slip.\" \"When I came in to the store yesterday, your sales clerk named John made an insulting remark about my appearance. I am very concerned since I visit your shop quite often and have been a loyal customer. I would like to file a grievance with your company.\"\n10. Control your temper. Even if you are feeling very frustrated, it is best to remain calm and polite at this stage. Resist the urge to yell or use insulting language. Some tips for controlling your anger include:\n\t* Taking deep breaths. Avoiding hyperbole and keeping your problem in perspective. Focusing on solving the problem. Communicating clearly.\n11. Use \"I\" statements to express your frustration. \"I\" statements are an effective way to express yourself without appearing to blame or take your anger out on someone. In an \"I\" statement, you simply state how you feel in first-person terms. For example, you might state:\n\t* \"I am disappointed in the quality of this product\" instead of \"Your company made a terrible product.\" \"I am frustrated that the delivery did not occur on time\" instead of \"Your delivery driver sucks.\" \"I hope that we can come to a resolution\" instead of \"You had better make this right.\"\n12. Do not lose sight of your goal. Sometimes a company might offer you a solution that is not quite what you had hoped for. For example, they might offer you store credit when what you want is a refund. Or they might only offer you a product repair instead of a new product. Consider whether what they offer you initially is fair. If not, hold firm about what you wanted to achieve through your complaint. Do not give in right away: be persistent and see if you can achieve your goal.\n13. Express your gratitude if your complaint is resolved. Many companies will attempt to help you at this stage by refunding your money, replacing your product, or giving you store credit. If this was your ideal solution, then you have effectively solved your complaint. Thank the customer service representative for his efforts. If the representative went above and beyond his duties, you might also write a letter of appreciation to his superior to express your happiness at his performance. If you are ignored or if your ideal solutions are not met at this stage, however, you might have to take further action.\n14. Follow up on the resolution. When both parties have agreed to a solution, give the other party ample time to implement it. After a fair amount of time, call them back to verify that the solution has been put in place. If they have been able to honestly and fairly assist you, they\u2019ll be glad to be able to give you the good news of your problem\u2019s resolution. If not, then you might want to consider contacting management or bringing in a third party.\n15. Turn to social media if you are being ignored. In some cases, a customer service representative may not be helpful or might refuse your call. In a case like this, social media can help draw attention to your plight and cause the company to begin working on your behalf. Consider writing a public Facebook post that links to the company's Facebook page or composing a Tweet directed at the company. This might help your voice be heard.\n16. Take your complaint to management if necessary. If you do not have any luck with customer service, consider talking to someone in a management or supervisory position. Be sure that you mention the steps you tried to take to resolve the issue before now and how disappointed you are in how you have been treated. If you get a supervisor's attention, you might be able to get the attention you deserve.\n17. Express your complaint in writing. At this stage, you will want to communicate with the company in writing. Writing conveys a sense of seriousness and also creates a paper trail that can help you pursue your complaint. Use a business letter format in order to write a letter of complaint. You can find a sample complaint letter here: https://www.usa.gov/complaint-letter. Keep a copy of your letter for your files. Be sure to include photocopies of relevant supporting documents such as receipts, credit slips, warranties, or contracts as evidence for your case.\n18. Get in touch with a consumer rights agency if necessary. If the complaints has not been resolved to your satisfaction yet, you might need to bring in a third party. There are many governmental and nonprofit agencies that exist to protect consumers and to regulate business practices. Some examples of these agencies include the Better Business Bureau, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Trade Commission. Many of these agencies allow you to submit a grievance through a simple online form. If you are located in the United States, you can find your local consumer protection agency using this web address: https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer\n\t* \n\t* The Better Business Bureau provides an online form you can use to file a complaint here: https://www.bbb.org/consumer-complaints/file-a-complaint/nature-of-complaint/\n\t* \n\t* If your complaint is regarding a financial institution or transaction (such as a line of credit), get in touch with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/\n\t* \n\t* If your complaint has to do with fraud or identity theft, you can get in touch with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/assistance/protection/index.html\n19. Contact the relevant licensing board. Many businesses are required to maintain a license with a local or national board. For example, doctors, restaurants, salons, and optometrists often need to maintain their standing with a licensing board. If your complaint is serious, you might consider contacting a representative of the licensing board to let them know of your concerns.\n20. Contact the government about fraud or abuse. If you think you have been the victim of a crime, you should contact the governmental authorities. Your complaint might help them prevent future scams and thefts. If you have been scammed, defrauded, or had your identity stolen, your complaint is serious enough to involve the state and is too serious for the company to handle internally.\n21. Go to small claims court to retrieve money. Small claims courts allow you to sue for small amounts of money--usually under $10,000. This amount is not worth the cost of most litigation proceedings, but small-claims courts provide a simple and inexpensive way to try to recoup your funds. Some of the most common cases in small claims courts are breaches of warranty or breaches of contract. Visit this website to determine the small-claims limit in your state if you live in the United States: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/types-cases-for-small-claims-court-29918.html\n22. Report your complaint publicly. Make sure that other potential customers are aware of serious issues with how a company does business. Provide an honest, objective review with consumer protection websites and publicly viewable review sites to ensure that others do not encounter the same problems you did. Alternatively, if your complaint was resolved in a quick and professional manner, you can leave a positive review with these sites and agencies to reward the company for their good work.\n\n\n## Resolve a complaint from a customer\n\n1. Remember that complaints are useful tools for your company. Do not resent a complaint from a customer. Consider complaints to be a free source of feedback on how your company is viewed by its patrons. Resist the urge to be angry, resentful, or grouchy at a complaining customer: instead, be grateful that they are making you aware of a potential problem with how you conduct business. A business's reputation depends less on the number of complaints they receive and more on how fairly and professionally they handle those complaints.\n2. Acknowledge their complaint quickly. A key to excellent customer service is responding as quickly as possible to a complaint. Get back to email complaints, complaints left over voicemail, or written complaints within two business days if at all possible. Even if you have not yet come up with a solution, you should let your customer know that you are working on it and that you have heard their concerns. Solving their complaint quickly will please your customer and will also save your company valuable time and energy. Try not to have complaints lead to multiple conversations or contacts: resolve all complaints on the spot if at all possible.\n3. Express your gratitude. Thank your customer for their patience, their business, and for taking the time to notify you of an issue. Your goal is not to make the customer disappear but rather to please the customer enough that she will continue using your goods and services.\n4. Listen actively. Use active listening techniques to make sure that you understand your customer's complaint and that they feel like they are being heard. Do not dismiss or ignore what they say: give them your full attention. Active listening involves:\n\t* Making eye contact\n\t* Nodding and using other affirming body language\n\t* Not getting distracted\n\t* Asking follow-up questions to make sure you understand them fully\n5. Apologize for their trouble. Do not blame the customer or avoid your own responsibility. Instead, apologize clearly and directly for your customer's problem. They will appreciate it, and an apology is a first step in approaching a resolution to make you and your customer happy. It is especially effective if you pair an apology with the beginnings of a proactive solution. You might say:\n\t* \"I am so sorry for your frustration. Let's work together to solve this matter.\" \"I would like to apologize on behalf of the company that your product never arrived. I will make sure that you receive a replacement shortly.\" \"I absolutely understand your frustration, and I am sorry for any trouble we might have caused. How can we make this better for you?\"\n6. Follow company grievance resolution procedure. Most large companies have policies to resolve the most common customer complaints such as defective products, undelivered products, or delayed services. Ideally the procedure should be one that protects the interest of both the customer and the company by weeding out illegitimate complaints and by granting customers recompense if their complaints is legitimate. It is easiest for you and your customer if you have a grievance procedure that is fair, simple, and fast. Technology can be very helpful in this regard: a website where customers can file complaints will make it easier for you and for them to reach a mutually beneficial solution.\n7. Implement the solution immediately. An immediate solution to a complaint can improve customer loyalty by 25%. Try to eliminate delays in refunding your customer's money, replacing their product, or giving them store credit. Make it possible for your staff members to undertake these transactions on the spot and in the store if possible. Common solutions include:\n\t* Refunding their money\n\t* Allowing them to exchange their product\n\t* Redelivering a delayed product\n\t* Redoing a service that was improperly done the first time, free of charge\n\t* Giving them store credit and future discounts\n8. Hire courteous, competent customer service employees. These jobs are an important part of maintaining your customer base and keeping up goodwill. Make sure that your customer service employees are problem-solvers who do not anger easily. Moreover, give them the leeway to solve customer grievance procedures on their own if possible: give them the power to resolve complaints on their own without referring customers to management. This will empower your customers and eliminate time delays.\n9. Follow up with your customer. A week or so after you have implemented the resolution, get in touch with your customer to see whether they are now satisfied. This is a great opportunity to apologize once again for their trouble and to thank them for their business. Hopefully they are now happy and will continue doing business with you.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A customer service manager or retail store owner who is seeking to improve their complaint resolution process.

{"conversations": ["How to drive economically?", "Everyone needs to use a car from time to time, but gas can be expensive. Driving more economically can save you money and keep your car\u2019s parts from wearing quickly. By avoiding aggressive driving, managing gears and electronics, and performing regular maintenance, you can drive more economically no matter where you\u2019re going.\n\n## Avoid aggressive drive\n\n1. Brake in a controlled manner. Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you\u2019ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don\u2019t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel.\n2. Accelerate smoothly. Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money.\n3. Minimize distractions. Whether you\u2019re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions. Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It\u2019s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.\n\n\n## Manage gear and electronics\n\n1. Use air conditioning wisely. At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way.\n2. Cut down on electronics. Your car\u2019s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren\u2019t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings.\n3. Use your gears effectively. Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car\u2019s engine. To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration. While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently. Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you\u2019re new to the technique.\n\n\n## Perform routine maintenance\n\n1. Check your tire pressure regularly. Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently.\n2. Use the right specification of engine oil. Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner\u2019s manual.\n3. Get your car serviced regularly. Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.\n\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Pack light. Bringing extra luggage or hauling large items requires more gas to get your car from place to place. Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle.\n2. Map your journey. Getting lost certainly won\u2019t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you\u2019re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient.\n3. Carpool when possible. Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You\u2019ll also save your car from more wear and tear.\n4. Combine errands. Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start \u201ccold\u201d less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally-focused individual, possibly a commuter or car owner, looking for ways to minimize their environmental impact while still maintaining a budget-friendly driving experience.

Both white fuming nitric acid and furfuryl alcohol are considered hazardous materials; none of the vehicles in the video appears to have a hazmat placard, the rocket is not an approved hazmat container, and the fuel containers seen in other videos are emphatically not approved.\n* No personal protective gear.  Nitric acid and furfurly alcohol are both toxic, and heavy loads are being lifted.  Nobody is seen wearing any sort of protective gear, not even hard hats or safety glasses.\n* Insecure rigging when lifting the test object upright.  A strap, particularly one being pulled at a sharp angle, is far less safe than a proper lifting point.\n* Bad angle when lifting the test object upright.  This puts excess loads on things, increasing the risk of a fall or failure.\n* Using unbraced legs as a pivot point when lifting the test object upright.  You can see they're on the verge of buckling.\n* (assumed) Lifting the test object while already fueled.  In the event of a fall, this ensures an explosion if the tanks rupture, as the fuels are hypergolic.\n* Having people stand under a suspended load.  If the test object falls, this will cause serious injury or death to at least two people.\n* Using a truck to pull the lifting cable.  This provides far less control than a proper winch.\n* Having personnel in the blast area of the test object.  In the event of an failure, this makes it highly likely that they will be engulfed in the fireball, struck by debris, or poisoned by fuel vapors.\n* Having personnel in the exhaust area of the test object.  Even during normal operation, they will be exposed to nitric acid, furfuryl alcohol, and assorted nitrogen oxides, all of which are highly toxic.\n* Having unnecessary equipment in the test area.  In the event of a failure, this can become additional flying debris.\n* Not properly securing the test object.  In the event of higher-than-expected performance, this will become self-propelled debris; in the event of a premature shutdown, the resulting hop-and-crash will rupture the fuel tanks and cause an explosion.\n* Not providing a flight termination system.  In the event that the test object becomes airborne, they have no way of keeping it from leaving the test area.\n* (assumed) Insufficient fire-extinguishing equipment on site.  None of the area views show a pumper truck or other equipment capable of dealing with a brush fire ignited by 15+ kg of hypergolic fuels.\n* Improper fire-extinguishing equipment.  At one point, you can see what appears to be an ordinary dry-chemical fire extinguisher.  This should not be used when dealing with nitric acid.\n* Oxidizer-rich shutdown.  You can see see the reddish cloud of nitric-acid byproducts at the end of the burn; this is likely the result of the oxidizer reacting with the engine.\n* (assumed) No post-burn decontamination of the area.  The celebratory post-burn shot shows no sign of cleanup.

So sadly, rather than dying with a Fatal error at this point, it issues this Notice and acts as though a constant had been defined with the same name and value:\n```// Implicit declaration of constant called department with value 'department'\ndefine('department', 'department');\n```\nThere are various ways you can get this error message, but they all have the same root cause - a token that could be a constant.\nStrings missing quotes:  ```$my_array[bad_key]```\nThis is what the problem is in your case, and it's because you've got string array keys that haven't been quoted.  Fixing the string keys will fix the bug:\nChange:\n```$department = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST[department]);\n...(etc)...\n```\nTo:\n```$department = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['department']);\n...(etc)...\n```\nVariable missing dollar sign: ```var_without_dollar```\nAnother reason you might see this error message is if you leave off the ```$``` from a variable, or ```$this->``` from a member.  Eg, either of the following would cause a similar error message:\n```my_local;   // should be $my_local\nmy_member;  // should be $this->my_member\n```\nInvalid character in variable name: ```$bad-variable-name```\nA similar but more subtle issue can result if you try to use a disallowed character in a  variable name - a hyphen (```-```) instead of an underscore ```_``` would be a common case.\nFor example, this is OK, since underscores are allowed in variable names:\n```if (123 === $my_var) {\n  do_something();\n}\n```\nBut this isn't:\n```if (123 === $my-var) {\n  do_something();\n}\n```\nIt'll be interpreted the same as this:\n```if (123 === $my - var) {  // variable $my minus constant 'var'\n  do_something();\n}\n```\nReferring to a class constant without specifying the class scope\nIn order to refer to a class constant you need to specify the class scope with ```::```, if you miss this off PHP will think you're talking about a global ```define()```.\nEg:\n```class MyClass {\n  const MY_CONST = 123;\n  public function my_method() {\n    return self::MY_CONST;  // This is fine\n  }\n  public function my_method() {\n    return MyClass::MY_CONST;  // This is fine\n  }\n  public function my_bad_method() {\n    return MY_CONST;  // BUG - need to specify class scope\n  }\n}\n```\nUsing a constant that's not defined in this version of PHP, or is defined in an extension that's not installed\nThere are some system-defined constants that only exist in newer versions of PHP, for example the mode option constants for ```round()``` such as ```PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN``` only exist in PHP 5.3 or later.\nSo if you tried to use this feature in PHP 5.2, say:\n```$rounded = round($my_var, 0, PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN);\n```\nYou'd get this error message:\n\n  Use of undefined constant PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN - assumed\n  'PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN' Warning (2): Wrong parameter count for round()\n"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "a PHP developer or web programmer encountering an error in their code.

{"conversations": ["How to buy school supplies?", "Shopping for school supplies can be stressful for both the seasoned shopper and the beginner. Working parents or guardians have to fight the crowds that gather on weekends or after the end of the workday. Even worse, the cost of school supplies steadily increases every year, costing families an average of just under $100 in 2015. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to stress out or go bankrupt. By spacing out your purchases and practicing a few money-saving hacks, you can survive the back-to-school madness.\n\n## Buy basic supply\n\n1. Get a list from your child\u2019s school. Don\u2019t rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isn\u2019t available on the school\u2019s website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites.\n2. Know the difference between requests and requirements. Before you panic over the long supply list on the school\u2019s website, realize that many of the items are merely requests. One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.\n3. Purchase writing supplies. Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper. Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art. Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but it\u2019s always a good idea to check the supply list in case your child\u2019s teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners. Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.\n4. Buy folders. Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc. ).\n5. Purchase a day planner. Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.\n6. Buy art supplies. Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.\n7. Purchase personal supplies. Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack. Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.\n8. Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag. Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time. However, textbooks haven\u2019t gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.\n\n\n## Shop for electronics\n\n1. Buy a calculator. High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:\n\t* Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30. Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.\n2. Purchase a computer. High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list. Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget.\n3. Buy external storage. Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.\n\n\n## Save money\n\n1. Sort out what you already have. Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldn\u2019t mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s). Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt. Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.\n2. Stick to basics and generics. Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Don\u2019t worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs.\n3. Take advantage of discounts. Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back. Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.\n4. Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks. Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.\n5. Buy refurbished. Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost. However, you should do your homework first. Only buy refurbished products from trusted retailers like Apple or Best Buy, which offer warranties and free repairs on known issues.\n6. Buy a little at a time throughout the year. There\u2019s no rule that you have to buy school supplies in July and August. Each time you\u2019re shopping for groceries or picking up a prescription, stop by the school supply aisle to look for unannounced discounts on common required supplies.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally-conscious small business owner or manager seeking practical strategies to minimize their carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable future.

{"conversations": ["How to identify a bandwagon fan?", "Ever notice how people \"suddenly\" become fans of teams that are performing well? Do you ever wonder if they are \"real fans\" like they claim to be? Or do you wonder if they're just bandwagon fans? Bandwagon fans are defined as sports fans who have shown no past loyalty to a team, and who only support them when they are doing well. While people may not admit to being bandwagon fans, there are easy ways to spot them.\n\n## Listen to what they say\n\n1. See if they know the staff. True fans of a team will know the names of more than just the star player on the team. See if they know other players, coaches, owners, and former players. This will help determine if they have any loyalty towards the team. Knowing the play-makers is great. But a true fan needs to know more than the offensive players. They need to know what's going on on both sides of the ball. Not every fan follows what goes on behind the scenes so cut them some slack if they don't know the athletic trainer or the newest draft picks.\n2. Determine if they know statistics. Knowing statistics takes both time and effort. Do they know the average number of points scored per game? Do they know where the team ranks offensively and defensively? True fans always find ways to track the progress of their favorite team. Their knowledge should go beyond stats for the star player or the team's record. They should be able to discuss the teams status as if they were commentators for ESPN, because it is both informative and entertaining for real fans.\n3. See if they know any historical information about the team. It's easy to know about a team's current progress, but it's more difficult to know about the history of a team. A fan who has been loyal for years will know past players, championship years, and significant games. Many fans will also have personal stories associated with the team. For example, they'll know exactly where they were when the Houston Rockets won back-to-back championships in 1994 and 1995. Many bandwagon fans only follow teams who have been successful over the last few years and will not know history that stretches beyond the team's current winning streak.\n4. Count how many teams they support. Fake fans usually divide their loyalty among more than one team. The more teams they support, the less of a true fan they are. Choosing a favorite sports team is like choosing a wife--you can only have one. In different sports, there are rules about teams you cannot support at the same time. For example, in baseball, you can't root for both the Yankees and the Mets. In football, you can't cheer for both the Texans and the Cowboys.\n5. Listen to their reasons for supporting the team. Most of the time loyalty to a team is determined by where you grew up or the player you idolized growing up. Bandwagon fans usually have flimsy excuses for why they support a team. For example, reasons such as liking the team logo, having a boyfriend or girlfriend that supports the team, or picking the team are not viable reasons. If your favorite team relocates to a different city then it is your choice to turn back on them or not. If you grew up in a city that didn't have a team for a specific sport, you're then able to pick a team (with good reason of course). If your team eventually gets a new franchise, it is your choice to stick with your current team, or start to follow the new one.\n6. See if they only support the best teams in the league. If the fan only supports the #1 teams in football, baseball, basketball, soccer or other major league sports, they are likely not supporting the team but supporting the winning streak. There will be times when your favorite team will consistently be successful, but it's a strange phenomenon when ALL of the teams you support are doing well. For example, it's perfectly acceptable to support the New England Patriots and their success. But to support them, the Boston Red Sox, the Golden State Warriors, and the Washington Capitals at the same time is a sign of being a bandwagon fan.\n\n\n## Watch what they do\n\n1. Notice if they go to games only when the team is successful. It's difficult to support a team when they are in a slump, but real fans do just that. Even if a real fan curses their team, they are there to support them the next game. Bandwagon fans jump off the wagon at the first sign of trouble. Going to a game takes more effort and more money. Bandwagon fans don't want to invest either if the team isn't doing well. The same is true of watching games on television.\n2. Ask why they leave the game early. True fans stay at a game until the bitter end--even if they know the result will be less than desirable. On the other hand, bandwagon fans tend to walk out and stop offering support to the team. Bandwagon fans often miss out on some of the best comebacks in sports because they choose to walk out during tough times. For example, in the 2013 NBA Finals in game six when the Miami Heat were down against the San Antonio Spurs, fans left early and missed out on a comeback. Also, in the NFC Championship Game between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks, they trailed so fans left the game early and missed out on an amazing onside kick recovery to eventually win the game and go to Super Bowl XLIX.\n3. Determine if they go to live games. If you don't cheer for the team in the area you grew up in, in favor of a team far away, that's one thing. But true fans still go to live sporting events for the experience of being around like-minded, passionate individuals. Bandwagon fans don't value the experience because they aren't as emotionally invested as real fans. Even if it means braving the cold or paying for over-priced beer, real fans will try to attend at least one game during the season. Some bandwagon fans will attend a game or two just to be able to say that they have. They are unlikely to attend games that aren't convenient. For example, when the weather is bad, when the tickets are too pricey, or when the game falls on a workday.\n4. See if they support the team only during playoffs. This has a bit to do with the team being successful, but it also has to do with the importance of the game. Regular seasons in sports tend to be long and grueling, so bandwagon fans like to skip the regular season games and jump right to the good part. Playoff games occur after the regular season and are tournament style games that lead up to the championship. Playoffs also bring out bandwagon fans whose \"first choice\" didn't make the playoffs. In order to have someone to root for, they will choose a team randomly and only for that season.\n5. Determine if they jump off the wagon. This is also known as wavering in their support of the team. If a fan stops supporting their team if they lose a playoff game, championship game, or don't make the playoffs at all, they're exhibiting behavior consistent with that of a bandwagon fan.\n\n\n## Identify a true fan\n\n1. See if they own a throwback jersey. A throwback jersey is one that duplicates a jersey worn by a team or player from the past. Real fans tend to purchase throwback jerseys (along side more modern sports gear) because they actually know the history of the team and its players. On the contrary, bandwagon fans typically purchase team gear that represents the more modern logos, colors, and players. True fans are also more likely to spend big bucks on team gear and throwbacks are usually more authentic and costly.\n2. Notice if they ever boo their team. True fans will never boo their team because they are trying to inspire them, not make them feel worse. It's okay to be angry with a less than perfect performance, but making your team feel like trash won't help. Real fans stick with their team for better or for worse.\n3. Determine if they support their team's players more than any others. A true fan's loyalty is always to his or her team first. That doesn't mean that they can't support or like other players, but it does mean that their loyalty lies with their team's players first. For example, it's fine to appreciate great players like Peyton Manning but if you're a New England Patriots fan you support Tom Brady first. Additionally, if you have players who are on your fantasy football team but are not on your favorite football team, you can support them only as far as it doesn't interfere with your favorite team's success.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An investor, financial analyst, or economist with a keen interest in understanding market trends and identifying potential risks.

Meanwhile, the current unemployment rate is 4.4% and projected to hit double digits in April. The only way all of that information could be appropriately priced in is if everyone agreed about the reasonableness of the projections and had the economic prowess to understand the actual impact of those figures.\nInstead, what happens is that some people will see the actual April unemployment numbers as surprising new information to react to, while others will see it as old information in line with their expectations. Add in thousands of other pieces of information about which people have conflicting opinions, and it becomes pretty much impossible to know in advance if that information was all priced in appropriately.\nThe most recent comparable event is the subprime mortgage crash.

{"conversations": ["How to save gift wrapping paper?", "We've all seen promotional material for having \"green\" (environmentally sound) events, conserving paper, and saving trees.  In this article we'll see several alternatives to one time usage of rolls of wrapping paper for gifts.\n\n## Reuse wrap paper\n\n1. Wrap the gift in such a way as to promote reuse: When selecting wrapping paper, select paper which is durable. When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.\n2. Unwrap the gift for reuse, too. When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper. Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.\n3. Share the paper with several guests. If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.\n\n\n## Use gift bag with a gift tag\n\n1. Purchase a nice gift bag (or reusable bag), rather than wrapping paper for each gift.\n2. Make and attach a large gift tag to the bottom of the bag covering the manufacturers name, etc. Include at least 12 rows on the tag. Write your name, email, occasion and date on the first row of the tag.\n3. Place gift item in bag and present to honoree as usual. After honoree removes the gift from the bag, they save the bag for the next occasion.\n4. When the honoree has an occasion to give a gift, they write their name, occasion and date on the first blank line on the tag.\n5. Repeat the re-use and gifting process 12 times.\n6. Have the twelfth person to receive the gift bag send an email to everyone listed on the tag with the bag's history. Assuming the bag remains in usable condition, they can then attach a new tag on top of the original tag and repeat the process.\n7. Keep the reuse and gifting chain going until the back is too worn to continue. Ultimately, recycle the bag.\n\n\n## Make a gift display rather than gift wrap\n\n1. Bring unwrapped gifts to the celebration.\n2. Place the gifts on a display table. Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.\n3. Prepare a one page log for the honoree. It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift. The honoree can then use this log to send Thank You notes. Only one sheet of paper is consumed for the entire event!\n4. When it is time to present the gifts, position the honoree behind the table along with the guests. Take photos of the covered table, uncover the table and photograph the table displaying the gifts. (Optionally, make a video of the table being uncovered.)\n\n\n## Gift wrap (blindfold) the honoree instead of the gift\n\n1. If your honoree is adventuresome, blindfold them with an attractive looking bandana or blindfold prior to displaying or presenting any gifts.\n2. Present each gift to the blindfolded honoree while the people giving the gift stand behind them.\n3. Have the honoree identify the gift by feeling of it. If you want to make the task more challenging have the honoree wear attractive looking gloves or mittens while doing this. Optionally, have the honoree guess who gave them the gift.\n4. Of course, take numerous photos (and possibly video) of the gift giving process.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A budget-conscious individual who enjoys gift-giving and is looking for ways to reduce waste and save money.

{"conversations": ["How to buy school supplies?", "Shopping for school supplies can be stressful for both the seasoned shopper and the beginner. Working parents or guardians have to fight the crowds that gather on weekends or after the end of the workday. Even worse, the cost of school supplies steadily increases every year, costing families an average of just under $100 in 2015. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to stress out or go bankrupt. By spacing out your purchases and practicing a few money-saving hacks, you can survive the back-to-school madness.\n\n## Buy basic supply\n\n1. Get a list from your child\u2019s school. Don\u2019t rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isn\u2019t available on the school\u2019s website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites.\n2. Know the difference between requests and requirements. Before you panic over the long supply list on the school\u2019s website, realize that many of the items are merely requests. One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.\n3. Purchase writing supplies. Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper. Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art. Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but it\u2019s always a good idea to check the supply list in case your child\u2019s teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners. Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.\n4. Buy folders. Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc. ).\n5. Purchase a day planner. Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.\n6. Buy art supplies. Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.\n7. Purchase personal supplies. Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack. Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.\n8. Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag. Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time. However, textbooks haven\u2019t gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.\n\n\n## Shop for electronics\n\n1. Buy a calculator. High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:\n\t* Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30. Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.\n2. Purchase a computer. High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list. Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget.\n3. Buy external storage. Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.\n\n\n## Save money\n\n1. Sort out what you already have. Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldn\u2019t mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s). Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt. Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.\n2. Stick to basics and generics. Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Don\u2019t worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs.\n3. Take advantage of discounts. Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back. Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.\n4. Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks. Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.\n5. Buy refurbished. Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost. However, you should do your homework first. Only buy refurbished products from trusted retailers like Apple or Best Buy, which offer warranties and free repairs on known issues.\n6. Buy a little at a time throughout the year. There\u2019s no rule that you have to buy school supplies in July and August. Each time you\u2019re shopping for groceries or picking up a prescription, stop by the school supply aisle to look for unannounced discounts on common required supplies.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally-conscious small business owner or manager seeking practical strategies to minimize their carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable future.

{"conversations": ["How to pay property taxes online?", "If you own real property (a home or land) in the United States, you are responsible for paying state property taxes each year. While these taxes are assessed through the county where the property is located, most counties in each state allow property owners to pay their taxes online. The specific information you need to pay your property taxes online depends on where your property is located.\n\n## Calculate your payments\n\n1. Look on your tax bill. You should receive an annual property tax statement in the mail that provides information about the amount of tax you owe each year. This statement also has other information, such as a property identification number or PIN, that may be necessary for you to pay your taxes online. Your tax bill may not include any delinquent taxes, or any other tax assessments, such as supplemental taxes. Those typically are sent separately.\n2. Check online if you haven't received a bill. Just because you don't receive a bill doesn't mean you don't owe property taxes. In most states and counties, you can find out how much tax you owe by going to your state or county's property tax website. The amount of tax online typically will be more up to date than what's on your bill, so even if you have your bill handy you may want to check online. If there's a discrepancy, go by the amount online rather than the amount on your bill. Unfortunately, you may need a PIN or identification number located on the bill to access your tax amount online.\n3. Call the tax assessor's office if you need more information. If you haven't received a bill and can't find the amount you owe on the website, you can always call the tax assessor's office and ask. The clerk should be able to give you the total amount of property tax you owe, as well as any other information you need, such as a PIN, so you can pay your taxes online.\n4. Confirm the types of property tax you owe. Some states or counties may have different types of property taxes that you'll have to pay. You may have to check for different types separately. For example, in California you may have secured and unsecured property taxes. Unsecured property taxes are taxes on watercraft, airplanes, or temporary fixtures that are not connected to real property. These may be listed separately, or included on separate websites. Depending on where you live, certain types of property taxes may not be included in the online information. For example, the property tax website for Cook County, Illinois, does not include amounts for back taxes, air pollution taxes, and some other types of property taxes.\n5. Confirm due dates for taxes owed. On the tax assessor's website, you'll find information about the dates property taxes are due each year. If you have any delinquent taxes, they typically are considered due immediately. If you pay your taxes on or before the due dates you'll avoid penalties, interest, and other fees. Plan ahead, especially if you won't be able to pay the total amount all at once.\n6. Determine how much of your taxes you can pay. Particularly if you have delinquent taxes, you may not be able to pay all of your taxes at once. Access the website well before the due date, if possible, so you can budget for your payments accordingly.\n7. Check to see if your mortgage company is paying your property taxes. If you have a mortgage on your property, your monthly mortgage payment may include an escrow amount that goes to pay your property taxes. When property taxes are due, your mortgage company will withdraw the money from the escrow account and pay them on your behalf. You typically still will get a bill or property tax statement, even though you don't owe anything. Check with your mortgage company if you're not sure so you don't end up paying twice.\n\n\n## Make your payments\n\n1. Visit your county or state's property tax website. Property taxes are assessed by county governments. The easiest way to find your county's property tax website is to check on your state's website for a link. Your state will have a .gov web address, so you can be assured that the link you find from the state website is the legitimate website for your county. This way you can make sure you keep all your information secure.\n2. Enter information for your property. The information you need to enter to access your account and pay your taxes online differs among states and counties. Typically you'll have a PIN or property identification number that you must enter to correctly find your property. A street address typically isn't enough, because property may be assessed using parcel numbers or some other system of organization.\n3. Do a search for your property. Some property tax assessors may allow you to look up the property identification number you need on the website itself. Others may require you to call the county tax assessor's office to get the information you need. If you don't have the information you need, look for a link that will allow you to search for your property. When you click on the link to pay your taxes, there should be a link close to the space where you would enter the information that you can follow to get the information you need.\n4. Review acceptable methods of payment. Depending on the county, different methods of payment are accepted if you want to pay your property taxes online. Some methods of payment may come with an additional fee. If you pay using an electronic check, you typically won't have to pay a fee. Using a debit or credit card may incur a fee ranging from a few dollars to 2 or 3 percent of the amount of your payment.\n5. Make your payment. Once you've entered the information you need and chosen your method of payment, simply enter the amount of money you want to pay along with your payment information to pay your property taxes online.\n6. Print your confirmation. Once you've submitted your payment, you'll typically get a confirmation screen that will include a unique confirmation number and an option to print the page for your records. You may also get a confirmation through email. If you get an email confirmation you don't necessarily have to print a paper copy, just make sure to save the email.\n\n\n## Use other online resources\n\n1. Create a portfolio. If you own several parcels of property in the same state or county, you may be able to create a portfolio of properties on your state or county's property tax website. The portfolio allows you to manage all of your property taxes in one place. Look for a link on the property tax page that will allow you to create a portfolio, and follow the instructions. If you don't see a link, look for a FAQ page and see if anything is listed about how to link multiple properties.\n2. Set up recurring payments. Some states and counties allow you to enter payment information once and schedule payments, which are automatically deducted from your bank account or credit card. If you have the option to schedule payments, this can be helpful with budgeting. You can schedule a partial payment each month so you don't have to pay the whole thing all at once. Mark your payment dates on your calendar or set a reminder on your phone so you don't forget that the payment is coming out.\n3. Subscribe to email notifications. Some counties provide email notifications that will alert you before the due date for property taxes, or when there have been changes to your account. If you weren't able to set up recurring payments, these notifications can help you ensure you don't miss a due date and incur additional penalties and fees. If you subscribe to email notifications, you may want to add the email address to your contacts list or preferred addresses list. This will ensure you actually receive the notifications and they don't fall into your spam folder.\n4. Apply for a payment plan. Most counties allow you to set up a payment plan if you have delinquent property taxes. You typically have to fill out an application, and may be subject to a credit check. Some counties also allow payment plans even if your taxes are current, if you anticipate you won't be able to pay the amount in full by the due date. If this option is available to you, it can save you in potential late fees and penalties. A payment plan typically requires the payments to be automatically debited from your bank account.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A homeowner or property owner seeking to understand the process of paying their property taxes online.

{"conversations": ["How to cut carbon arrows?", "Carbon arrows are a lightweight alternative to aluminum, but they may not always come in the correct length you need. While you can always take the arrows into a hunting store to have them cut by a professional, you can also cut arrows at home with a rotary cutter or an arrow saw. Before you cut the arrows, be sure to measure your draw length to know how long the shafts need to be. When you\u2019re finished, your arrows will be the perfect size!\n\n## Find the proper arrow length\n\n1. Hold a tape measure out to your side with your non-dominant hand. Grip the tape measure in your nondominant hand so the tape points toward your wrist. Fully extend your nondominant arm out to your side so it\u2019s parallel to the ground to simulate holding a bow. Make sure you can easily grab and pull the tape toward you, and reposition the tape measure in your hand if you can\u2019t. Avoid using a fabric tape measure since it may give you an inaccurate measurement.\n2. Pull the tape to the corner of your mouth with your dominant hand. Grab the end of the tape with your dominant hand and slowly pull it out. Keep pulling the tape until the end touches the corner of your mouth on the dominant side of your body. For example, pull it to the right corner of your mouth if you\u2019re right-handed. Once the tape measure is fully extended, look at the measurement. Pulling the tape measure to the corner of your mouth simulates drawing a bowstring so you can get an accurate measurement for your draw length.Tip: Put your nondominant thumb on the tape measure before checking the measurement so it doesn\u2019t retract. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to measure again.\n3. Add 2 in (5.1 cm) to your measurement to find the arrow length. If your arrow is too short, it could jam your bow or cause the arrow to shoot improperly. Take the draw length measurement you just found and include an extra 2 inches (5.1 cm) to ensure that the arrows are long enough for your bow. For example, if your draw length measurement was 29 inches (74 cm), then the length of your arrow should be 31 inches (79 cm).\n4. Transfer your measurement onto the arrow shaft. Start your measuring tape at the back of the arrow shaft and extend the tape toward the front. When you reach the measurement you found, use a marker to draw a line or dot on the arrow shaft so you know where to cut. Rotate the arrow 180 degrees and make another mark in the same place to use as reference. Don\u2019t include the arrow\u2019s nock in the measurement since nock sizes vary between arrows. Start at the base of the arrow shaft instead.\n\n\n## Use a rotary cutter\n\n1. Clamp a rotary cutter horizontally over the edge of the table. A rotary cutter is a handheld multitool that spins quickly to cut through materials. Use a rotary cutter with a circular carbide blade so it can easily cut through the carbon arrows without deforming them. Lay the rotary cutter horizontally so the blade is vertical and hangs over the edge of your work surface. Use a C-clamp to secure the tool to your work surface so it doesn\u2019t shift around while you\u2019re using it. You can buy a rotary cutter from your local hardware store.Tip: Make sure you can easily access the power switch on the tool so you can turn it on and off when you need it.\n2. Position the hose of a shop vacuum behind the rotary blade. Cutting carbon arrows creates dust that can cause irritation if you breathe it in, so it\u2019s easiest to vacuum it immediately to prevent it from spreading. Set the end of the hose on your work surface so it\u2019s directly behind the rotary cutter\u2019s blade. Connect the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum. You can also use your regular vacuum if you don\u2019t have a shop vacuum available.\n3. Put on safety glasses and a face mask before turning the machines on. Carbon dust can cause irritation if it gets in your eyes or lungs, so it\u2019s important to stay protected while you work. Put on safety glasses that cover your eyes completely, and a face mask that guards your nose and mouth. Once you put on your safety equipment, you can start the rotary tool and the vacuum. Even though you have a vacuum capturing most of the dust, there still may be particles floating around.\n4. Cut the arrow along the mark you made. Once your rotary tool is spinning at full speed, carefully guide the arrow so the blade lines up with the marks you made earlier. Push the shaft gently against the blade so it cuts into the carbon. Continue pushing the arrow into the blade until it cuts completely through the other side. If the blade has difficulty cutting the arrow straight through, try rotating the arrow while you hold it against the blade to make it easier.\n\n\n## Cut shaft with an arrow saw\n\n1. Attach a shop vacuum hose to the port on the back of an arrow saw. Many arrow saws have a port on the back where you can attach a vacuum hose to collect dust. Push the end of a shop vacuum hose into the dust collection port on the arrow saw until it\u2019s secured in place. Attach the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum. You can buy arrow saws from hunting supply stores or you can order them online. Arrow saws usually cost around $130 USD. You can use your regular vacuum if you don\u2019t have access to a shop vacuum.Tip: If your arrow saw doesn\u2019t have a port for a vacuum hose, then set the hose as close to the blade as you can.\n2. Wear safety glasses and a face mask while you\u2019re cutting arrows. Carbon arrows create carbon fiber dust when you cut them, which can be irritating if you inhale it or if it gets in your eyes. Wear safety glasses that cover your eyes completely and put on a face mask to protect your mouth and nose. Once you have the face mask and safety glasses on, you can turn on your machines.\n3. Position the arrow on the saw so the back sits inside of the notch on the support. Your arrow saw will have a support with a notch on it so your arrow doesn\u2019t roll around while you\u2019re cutting it. Set the back of the arrow in the notch and line up the front of the arrow so the mark you made on the shaft lines up with the saw blade. Your arrow saw may have multiple supports on it. If so, make sure the arrow sits in all of the notches to ensure you make a straight cut.\n4. Rotate the arrow while it\u2019s against the saw blade to cut completely through it. Once your arrow saw is running at full speed, slowly push the arrow shaft into the blade. Once it starts cutting into the arrow, spin the arrow so the blade cuts around the circumference of the shaft. As soon as you around the circumference of the arrow, the end will fall off and you can turn off your saw. Your arrow saw may be powerful enough to cut through the shaft without rotating it.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an archer or bowhunter with a keen interest in sustainable practices.

{"conversations": ["How to look up a bible verse?", "People quote the Bible in a variety of contexts. If you want to be able to look those quotes up, you\u2019ll need to understand the way the Bible is organized. It\u2019s also possible to look up quotes without knowing their location. Simply knowing a couple of words from a verse can be enough to help you locate it if you know how.\n\n## Look up a verse by number\n\n1. Identify the book of the verse. When Bible verses are listed, the first thing you\u2019ll see is the name of a book. Use the table of contents in your Bible to locate that book within it. The table of contents is at the beginning of the Bible. Locate the name in the table of contents and turn to the page associated with the start of the book. The name of the book might be abbreviated or spelled out completely. Some books include:\n\t* Exodus (Ex)\n\t* Genesis (Gen)\n\t* Numbers (Num)\n2. Identify the chapter. After the book name, you\u2019ll see two numbers. The first number is the chapter. For example, in \u201cJohn 3:16\u201d, \u201c3\u201d is the chapter number. Look at the verse and determine which chapter it is from in the book. Some people may cite Bible verse using abbreviations and Roman numerals. For example, Lev. xx:13 is the same as Leviticus, chapter 20, verse 13. Locate that chapter within the book. You may be able to find the location of that chapter in the table of contents. If not, you can thumb through the specific book until you see that chapter. As with other books, it should clearly say, \u201cChapter \\_\\_\u201d at the beginning of each chapter. In addition, many versions clearly say,  : at the top of each page indicating the first verse on that page. Some also note the last verse on the page.\n3. Identify the verse number. The second number after the book name is the verse number. This number should come after a colon (:). In the case of John 3:16, 16 would be the verse number. If you're looking up a longer passage, there may be two numbers, separated by a hyphen (-). For example, in John 3:16-18, you're looking for verses 16,17, and 18.\n4. Locate the verse within the chapter. Once you\u2019ve found the chapter, go through it until you find the verse. The verses go in numerical order, just like chapters. There should be a small number at the beginning of each sentence or a small group of sentences. This is the verse number. If you're looking for multiple verses, such as John 3:16-18, 17 and 18 would follow directly after 16.\n\n\n## Look up a verse with a concordance\n\n1. Choose a concordance. A concordance is a book that lists every instance of a word\u2019s appearance in the Bible. This is a great tool if you remember the verse, or part of the verse, but you don\u2019t know which book or chapter it came from. Concordances can be found through religious retailers or online. Your church may also have one that you can borrow.\n2. Search for a word from the verse. Remember an important word from the verse. Look it up in the concordance the same way that you would look it up in a dictionary. Concordances are alphabetized. Choose a distinctive word that may have limited occurrences, such as \u201cflood,\u201d \u201cmountain,\u201d or \u201crubies.\u201d If you choose something like \u201clove\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d you\u2019re likely to find an enormous number of results.\n3. Search for other words if necessary. If you find too many results, or you don\u2019t see the verse you\u2019re looking for, try searching for another word. For example, if you remember the phrase, \u201clove must be sincere\u201d and you searched \u201clove\u201d but found too many results, try looking up, \u201csincere.\u201d\n4. Locate the verse from the concordance list. The concordance will list all of the places where that word is found in the Bible. A complete concordance will give you some context so that you can be sure it\u2019s the verse you\u2019re looking for. Use the location that the concordance gives you (for example, Romans 12:9) to look up the complete verse and its context in your bible.\n5. Try another translation if necessary. Concordances are specific to translations. If you can\u2019t find the verse you\u2019re looking for, try a concordance for a different translation. For example, if your Bible translated a word to the English word \u201cpraise,\" but your concordance is for a Bible that translated that word as \u201cworship,\u201d it will be impossible to look up the verse.\n\n\n## Look up a verse online\n\n1. Search the verse number online. Choose a search engine, or go to a website dedicated to Bible study. Type the name of the book and the chapter and verse numbers into the search engine. Type the verse number in the generally accepted format if you can. For example, you'll get more accurate results if you type, \"John 3:16,\" than, \"Chapter 3 16 John.\"\n2. Remember what you can about the verse. Do you remember a certain phrase of the verse? Maybe you remember one or two words and the name of the book it came from. Even if you can\u2019t remember very much, you can likely still look up the verse.\n3. Enter what you know into a search engine. Type in everything you can remember. You should also include the words \u201cBible\u201d and \u201cverse\u201d to make sure that you get results that are relevant to your search. Your search terms may be something like, \u201cBible verse about wives in Psalms,\u201d or \u201cBible verse chapter 7 desert.\u201d\n4. Use a site designed for Bible searches. There are plenty of sites online that catalog Bible verses by subject or by book. You can use one of these websites to search for the verse. Type in a keyword or a subject. You may also be able to do an advanced search by book or chapter. These online tools can be great ways to find other verses that may be relevant to you or helpful in your studies or prayers.\n5. Search related words. If you can\u2019t remember any exact words from the verse, or your search is not going well, search related words. For example, if you searched for \u201cstars\u201d and didn\u2019t find anything, you could search for \u201cnight\u201d or \u201csky\u201d or \u201cheavens\u201d to see if the verse shows up. It\u2019s possible you\u2019re using a different translation or that you misremembered details about the verse.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "a devout individual or someone seeking spiritual guidance, possibly a Christian who wants to find specific verses in the Bible for personal reflection, study, or sermon preparation.

It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries.

Please note I used human beings as an example to give context but the species undergoing devolution may not necessarily be human.\nBased on the answers, \"devolution\" does not exist so had the word in quotes to reflect this.

They haven't actually devolved to not have eyes, they simply did not need them and evolved to save valuable energy and nutrients by not growing a sight organ that would be useless in their environment. It isn't devolution, it's still evolution since they are changing to better suit their environment. So, at least as far as natural processes go, a species would need to become stuck in an environment for a few hundred thousand years that heavily discourages intellect, sociability, communication skills, culture, and inventiveness.

Those big craniums and complex brains waste space and make childbirth more dangerous than necessary.

{"conversations": ["How to make a model water tower?", "Water towers are large, elevated tanks of water that are essential for the distribution of clean water to many communities across the globe. Not only do they come in many different shapes and sizes, but it\u2019s intriguing to learn about the way water towers work. Whether you need a model water tower for a train set or school project, or you simply want to learn about the way they work, you can easily build your own model with the right materials and know-how.\n\n## Create a function model water tower\n\n1. Locate a small plastic bottle and a large plastic bottle. The small water bottle can be a standard-sized Coke, juice, or water bottle, as long as it has a screw-on cap. The large bottle should be a 2-liter soda bottle, jug, or a large juice bottle. Test the size of your bottles by placing the small bottle upside-down, with its neck sticking into the opening on the large bottle. The small bottle should sit comfortably on top of the large one. If it does not, you will need to find different bottles. The bottles must be plastic, as you will need to cut them.\n2. Remove the cap from the small bottle and cut a hole in the middle of it. Use scissors to punch a hole into the center of the cap, then widen the hole until it\u2019s slightly smaller than the circumference of the holes at both ends of the tubing. Water will leak out of the hole if it\u2019s too big, but it will still need to be big enough to push the tubing into it. It\u2019s better to have a hole that\u2019s too small than a hole that\u2019s too big, as you can always use your scissors to widen it if necessary.\n3. Punch a pin-sized hole in the bottom of the small water bottle. Use a pin, needle, earring, or any other device that will create an almost invisible hole. This will allow the bottle to vent when the water starts flowing.\n4. Cut a medium-sized hole in the side of the large bottle. Make the hole big enough that the cap and tubing can both fit through it. You can put the hole anywhere on the bottle that you choose, but roughly halfway down the bottle is a good option. Unlike the small bottle, you don\u2019t have to worry about leaks if this hole isn\u2019t the right size. This hole can be large or small just as long as the cap and tubing will fit through it comfortably.\n5. Feed 1 end of the tubing through the hole in the large bottle. Push the tubing through the large hole and out through the top of the large bottle. Lay the large bottle on its side with the hole you cut facing upward for easier access.\n6. Squeeze the same end of the tubing into the hole you cut in the cap. Feed roughly 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of tubing in through the cap. Clamp the binder clip roughly 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end of the other side of the tubing. Put the side of the tubing with the binder clip into a bowl that will catch the water. If your hole on the cap is the right size, you will have to forcefully push the tubing into the hole. It should fit snugly in the hole without slipping.\n7. Fill the small bottle with water. Once the bottle is full, place the cap with the tubing through it on top of the bottle. Feed the tubing into the water, then screw the cap on tightly. Hold your finger over the pin-sized hole on the bottom of the bottle to keep water from leaking out.\n8. Place the small bottle upside-down in the top opening on the large bottle. The neck of the small bottle should fit all the way into the opening on the large bottle. You now have a functioning model water tower! The water should flow into the tubing once you flip it upside down, but the binder clip will stop the flow. Experiment by releasing the clip at different heights to see where the water stops flowing.\n\n\n## Build a model water tower with popsicle stick\n\n1. Cut the rounded ends off of roughly 70 Popsicle sticks. Barely snip both ends of each Popsicle stick to make the ends straight on both sides. Make them all as close to the same size as possible. To cut the sticks evenly, line up the second stick with the first stick you cut. Use the first Popsicle stick as reference for where to cut the second stick. Do the same thing for the third, the fourth, and so on, until all 70 Popsicle sticks are the same size.\n2. Snip 2 of the cut Popsicle sticks in half. You don\u2019t have to measure them, but cut them as close to the center as possible. You will now have 4 smaller pieces of Popsicle stick that are roughly half the length of the other Popsicle sticks.\n3. Apply glue to 1 end of 1 of the small stick sections. Connect the edge of a second small stick to the area where you just applied glue. Then, apply glue to the end of the second piece that is not connected. Glue the edge of a third small section to the open second section. Repeat this process for the fourth section, then apply glue to connect the edge of the fourth section to the open edge of the first section you glued. You will now have a square frame made out of the 4 smaller Popsicle pieces. Your frame doesn\u2019t have to be perfectly square. In fact, if you\u2019re going for a rustic look, an imperfect square may even be ideal. If you\u2019re using super glue, you can apply glue to all 4 edges before connecting them all together. If you\u2019re using hot glue, make sure to glue each edge separately. This will keep the glue from drying before you can connect all 4 sections together.\n4. Line up 2 larger Popsicle sticks to create 1 long, straight stick. Place the sticks on a flat surface with their ends touching. Take another Popsicle stick of the same size and apply glue to the entire surface on 1 side, lengthwise. Place the glued side directly in the middle of the 2 sticks that are lined up. The third stick does not have to be exactly in the middle of the other 2 sticks, but it should be close enough that it holds the other 2 sticks together evenly.\n5. Repeat this process 3 more times. Follow the same process as before by lining up 2 of the larger Popsicle sticks and gluing a third stick on top of them. Do this 3 more times until you have 4 identical long sections that are each made out of 3 glued Popsicle sticks.\n6. Connect the end of 1 of the long sticks to the inside corner of the square frame. Apply glue to the inside edge of the long stick and place it at a slight outward angle, with the third stick that is holding the other 2 sticks together facing inward. Glue the long stick so that it does not poke out above the frame once connected. Do the same thing with the other 3 long sections you created in the other 3 corners of the frame. This will form the legs of the water tower, so make the angle as identical as possible for each of the long sticks. Keep the angle of the legs around 10-15 degrees. If the angle is too steep, the water tower will be too short. If it is too steep, it will probably topple over.\n7. Use another Popsicle stick to connect 2 of the legs together. Apply glue to each inside edge of the stick. Place the edges of the Popsicle stick on top of the lines where the 2 Popsicle sticks used to create the legs meet. Do the same thing with 3 other sticks until you have a stick connecting the legs on all 4 sides. You will need to spread the legs apart so that the sticks do not hang outside the edge of the leg. Keep the connecting sticks as level as possible. You want it to appear as if there is a single, continuous stick wrapping around the legs of the tower, not 4 separate small sticks.\n8. Lay 9 Popsicle sticks side-by-side on a flat surface. Line them up along their long edges so the sticks make a square when lined up. Apply a line of glue on the edge of the square down the length of all 9 Popsicle sticks. Place another Popsicle stick along the same direction as the glue line so that it holds all 9 sticks together. Do the same thing with another line of glue and another Popsicle stick on the other end of the square. The Popsicle sticks used to hold the other 9 sticks together should be the same length as the square, so that they match up perfectly with both corners and do not hang over the edge. You may need to trim the sticks down or remove one of the 9 sticks to match up the lengths. Use your hand to hold the Popsicle stick square together as you glue it. Place your hand flat on top of all 9 sticks, and do your best to keep them all together with no gaps between them.\n9. Apply glue to the top edge of the square frame you made earlier. Place the square platform you just created on top of the frame, connecting it to the base structure you already made. Glue the platform so that the Popsicle sticks used to connect the other sticks together are facing downward. You can also glue each individual Popsicle stick directly onto the square frame you made earlier. It will take longer, but you may be able to line the sticks up better this way.\n10. Cut the rim off of a small paper Dixie cup. Cut around the top of the open side to remove the outer rim. Try to keep the line as straight as possible, since this will form the foundation for the water container part of your water tower.\n11. Glue the remaining Popsicle sticks to the outside of the Dixie cup. Place glue along one of the wide edges of a Popsicle stick. Line up the top edge of the stick with the bottom edge of the cup and glue it down. Repeat this process around the entire circumference of the cup until it is completely covered. When gluing the sticks onto the cup, fan them out from one another to create a more realistic look. When you place the second stick on the cup, keep the edge of the stick as close to the edge of the cup as possible, but fan out the end that is jutting over the edge of the cup by about 5 degrees so that a small sliver of the cup can be seen underneath. Roughly half of the length of each Popsicle stick will be glued to the Dixie cup, while the other half will be jutting out over the rim of the cup.\n12. Cover the gaps in the Popsicle sticks by gluing another layer on top. If you fanned out the sticks to create a more realistic look, go back over the cup with additional Popsicle sticks. Glue the sticks directly in the middle of two sticks on the bottom layer so that the second layer covers up any slivers of cup that may be showing. Keep the edges lined up with the bottom edge of the cup as best you can.\n13. Place the Dixie cup in the middle of the platform with the open side up. Apply glue around the entire circumference of the bottom of the cup. Then, stick it down as close to the middle of the platform as possible. Use a lot of glue to attach the Dixie cup so that it doesn\u2019t fall off if it\u2019s bumped. Optionally, you can wrap a string around the bottom and middle of the Dixie cup to give it a Western look. Wrap the string several times for better results.\n14. Use 2 wooden dowels to create a ladder. Place 2 wooden dowels roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart on a flat surface. Line them up so they are parallel with the pointy side on top. Use small sections of Popsicle sticks roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) long to create the steps. Apply glue to both ends of 1 side of the stick, then place it horizontally between the dowels so that it connects them together. Do this all the way up the 2 dowels, roughly 7 times, until about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the pointy side of the dowels is left sticking out.\n15. Lean the ladder against the water tower at an angle and secure it with glue. Glue another small section of Popsicle stick horizontally across the very tips of the dowels, above and on the opposite side of the steps. Lean it up against the side of your water tower with the tips facing up. Place glue on the backside of the tips of the dowel and press down to attach it.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A hobbyist or DIY enthusiast with an interest in architecture, engineering, or model building.

Grammatical words that don't have any meaning on their own (function words?) like have to, going to (not present continuous), has, is, was, will etc., are highly susceptible to these sound changes. For instance, have to is often pronounced hafta, trying to is pronounced tryna, want to is wanna etc etc. The same thing happened to the phrase I'm going to.\n\nThere are a few processes involved in the reduction of I'm going to to ima.\n\n* I'm going to \u2192 I'm gonna: the consonant t is often dropped in many other clusters and grammatical constructions as well (as in tryna, wanna etc). Here it's dropped and the vowel of to\u2014which is usually a schwa [\u0259]\u2014is linked with the preceding word; going to \u2192 gonna: [\u02c8\u0261\u0259\u028a\u026a\u0303\u014bt\u0259] \u2192 [\u02c8g\u0259\u0303n\u0259]\n\n* Deletion of the /g/: plosives (/g t d k/ etc) require great effort to articulate (the air is completely blocked and then released), so people dropped the plosive /g/ to make its articulation easier: [a\u026a\u0303m g\u0259\u0303n\u0259] \u2192 [a\u026a\u0303m \u0259\u0303n\u0259] (i'm ana)\n\n* linking I'm and gonna: In causal and connected speech, consonants and vowels are often linked by a process called liaison, so both I'm and gonna join together and become [a\u026a\u0303m\u0259\u0303n\u0259] (i'mana).\n\n* Syncope of the vowel in the second syllable: Unstressed schwas are often lost through syncope (for example, 'chocolate' is choc.late for most speakers). If we removed the schwa from the second syllable, we'd get [a\u026amn\u0259] (i'mna).\n\n* Deletion of /n/: It's simple cluster reduction. In English, two nasals that are next to each other are often reduced to a single nasal (as in damn), so the /n/ is deleted, yielding in this case [a\u026a\u0303m\u0259] (i'ma). Or people dropped the /n/ for the sake of ease.\n\nSome people further reduce the diphthong [a\u026a] it to something like [a], which results in [a\u0303m\u0259] (ama)\nThat's why people spell it that way.

{"conversations": ["How to drive economically?", "Everyone needs to use a car from time to time, but gas can be expensive. Driving more economically can save you money and keep your car\u2019s parts from wearing quickly. By avoiding aggressive driving, managing gears and electronics, and performing regular maintenance, you can drive more economically no matter where you\u2019re going.\n\n## Avoid aggressive drive\n\n1. Brake in a controlled manner. Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you\u2019ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don\u2019t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel.\n2. Accelerate smoothly. Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money.\n3. Minimize distractions. Whether you\u2019re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions. Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It\u2019s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.\n\n\n## Manage gear and electronics\n\n1. Use air conditioning wisely. At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way.\n2. Cut down on electronics. Your car\u2019s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren\u2019t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings.\n3. Use your gears effectively. Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car\u2019s engine. To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration. While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently. Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you\u2019re new to the technique.\n\n\n## Perform routine maintenance\n\n1. Check your tire pressure regularly. Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently.\n2. Use the right specification of engine oil. Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner\u2019s manual.\n3. Get your car serviced regularly. Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.\n\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Pack light. Bringing extra luggage or hauling large items requires more gas to get your car from place to place. Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle.\n2. Map your journey. Getting lost certainly won\u2019t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you\u2019re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient.\n3. Carpool when possible. Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You\u2019ll also save your car from more wear and tear.\n4. Combine errands. Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start \u201ccold\u201d less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally-focused individual, possibly a commuter or car owner, looking for ways to minimize their environmental impact while still maintaining a budget-friendly driving experience.

{"conversations": ["How to teach a child to use scissors?", "Most children around age 2 or 3 are ready to begin using scissors. It's important for children to know how to be safe with scissors. Once they're ready, using scissors can be an excellent way for the child to build fine motor skills and patience.\n\n## Prepare to teach\n\n1. Try fine motor skill activities to prepare the child for using scissors. Children need to build fine motor skills before they're ready to use scissors. Here are some activities that can help build the child's skills, and help you know if the child is ready:\n\t* Precision: Squeezing watercolor paint from an eyedropper onto paper, playing with finger puppets\n\t* \n\t* Bilateral coordination: Tearing up paper from the recycling bin\n\t* \n\t* Finger and hand strength: Spinning a top, punching holes with a hole punch, playing with squirt guns, using clothes pins\n2. Evaluate the child's ability to follow directions. The child should be able to follow instructions like \"stop\" or \"put it down, please.\" If a child isn't able to follow safety rules, then they shouldn't be given anything dangerous.\n3. Choose the right pair of scissors. Safety scissors are ideal for young children. Choose right-handed or left-handed scissors based on your child's dominant hand.\n4. Know that most kids are ready to use scissors around the age of 2 or 3. Many young children are able to use scissors.Talk to an occupational therapist if you think your child is struggling or has a disability that might delay their learning to use scissors. There are adaptive scissors for kids with disabilities, and special techniques to help kids who struggle with scissors. A delay isn't the end of the world. It just means things will happen a little differently.\n\n\n## Teach how to use scissor\n\n1. Let the child see you use a scissors. Show them how you do it, and let them watch. If they're curious, then you'll know they're most likely ready to learn.\n2. Start with the grip. Show the child in your hand how to hold the scissors, and then have them try to copy it. If they aren't able to alone, help move their fingers and thumb into the right position. Teach them that the thumb always goes in the hole. Draw an eyeball on the small thumb hole and explain that the eyeball will always be on top. Teach them that two fingers in the larger hole. Help them put their index finger and their middle finger in the hole.\n3. Have the child practice opening and closing the scissors. This practice will help the child build up the strength to control the scissors.\n4. Try having the child do their best to cut in a line or other shapes. Try drawing lines or shapes for the child to cut. After they do it, praise them. (Keep in mind that they may not be very precise yet; they're still young.)\n5. Find ways to make it fun. Let the child be creative. Try letting them cut colored paper, yarn, and other materials. Using scissors can be another way the child works on expressing themselves (all while building essential motor skills).\n6. Practice with the child how to turn the paper with one hand and cut with the other. This will prevent the child from turning the scissors up side down. Show the how to move the paper along with shuffling motions so that they maintain control of both the paper and the scissors.\n\n\n## Teach scissor safety\n\n1. Tell the child that scissors can hurt people if misused. It helps if kids don't just know what the rules are, but if they know why the rules are important. Explain that using scissors the wrong way can result in somebody getting hurt, and that's why the rules matter. Tell them that as long as they are following the rules, they don't have to worry.\n2. Explain that scissors are only for cutting paper. Fingers, hair, clothing, crayons, and other things are off-limits. If you decide to have the child practice with cutting Play Doh first, you can say that scissors are only for paper and Play Doh.If the child asks about why scissors are used for haircuts, explain \"Only adults can use scissors to cut hair, because they have more practice to make sure they don't mess up. Some adults go to a hair cutting school to learn how to do it right, and once they go there, they're allowed to cut hair.\"\n3. Explain that you need to walk carefully with scissors, if at all. Scissors can hurt people, so it's important to be careful. Some adults forbid walking with scissors at all, while others allow children to do it if the kids are careful. The best way to walk with scissors is to hold the closed blades in the fist. Walking this way reduces the risk of the child playing with the blades while walking, or falling and hurting themselves on the blades. Explain that running with scissors is extremely dangerous. If the child is going too fast, say \"Walking feet\" to remind them to slow down. Take away the scissors if they continue behaving dangerously.\n4. Take away the scissors if the child doesn't follow the rules. Give a reminder, and see if the child listens. If not, then you may decide to take away scissor privileges until the child is ready for another chance.

{"conversations": ["What does ```class``` do in Ruby?", "First, the ```class``` syntax opens up ```foo```'s singleton class (eigenclass). This allows you to specialise the behaviour of methods called on that specific object.\n```a = 'foo'\nclass << a\n  def inspect\n    '\"bar\"'\n  end\nend\na.inspect   # => \"bar\"\na = 'foo'   # new object, new singleton class\na.inspect   # => \"foo\"\n```\n\nNow, to answer the question: ```class``` opens up ```self```'s singleton class, so that methods can be redefined for the current ```self``` object (which inside a class or module body is the class or module itself). Usually, this is used to define class/module (\"static\") methods:\n```class String\n  class << self\n    def value_of obj\n      obj.to_s\n    end\n  end\nend\nString.value_of 42   # => \"42\"\n```\nThis can also be written as a shorthand:\n```class String\n  def self.value_of obj\n    obj.to_s\n  end\nend\n```\nOr even shorter:\n```def String.value_of obj\n  obj.to_s\nend\n```\n\nWhen inside a function definition, ```self``` refers to the object the function is being called with. In this case, ```class``` opens the singleton class for that object; one use of that is to implement a poor man's state machine:\n```class StateMachineExample\n  def process obj\n    process_hook obj\n  end\nprivate\n  def process_state_1 obj\n    # ...\n    class << self\n      alias process_hook process_state_2\n    end\n  end\n  def process_state_2 obj\n    # ...\n    class << self\n      alias process_hook process_state_1\n    end\n  end\n  # Set up initial state\n  alias process_hook process_state_1\nend\n```\nSo, in the example above, each instance of ```StateMachineExample``` has ```process_hook``` aliased to ```process_state_1```, but note how in the latter, it can redefine ```process_hook``` (for ```self``` only, not affecting other ```StateMachineExample``` instances) to ```process_state_2```.

{"conversations": ["How to take care of kittens?", "## Help your female cat give birth and care for newborns (0 to 4 weeks)\n\n1. Provide a quiet place for the birth. Your female cat will chose a place where she feels safe to give birth. By all means, provide a large cardboard box, turn it on its side and line it with warm, dry bedding\u2013but don't be disappointed if she has other ideas. Instinct tells her to find a quiet concealed spot, such as under a bed, behind a sofa, or inside a kitchen cabinet. To learn more about helping your cat give birth, see this article.\n2. Do not disturb during the birth and first two days. The first 48 hours is a crucial time for the mother to bond with her kittens, so try not to disturb her. If she gives birth under your bed, leave her there. Moving the newborn kittens will distress the mother and in the worst scenario could cause her to reject them. Once she is firmly bonded, at around four or five days, if you feel it's necessary to move the kittens, do it then.\n3. Leave food, water, and cat litter in the room. The mother won't want to leave her kittens for long in the first two weeks of their life. Always put food and water within stretching distance of her nest, and if possible, offer a litter tray in the same room so that she can stay within sight and sound of the kittens. If food is in another room, some mothers chose to starve rather than leave their newborn kittens to find it.\n4. Feed the mother extra calories. She needs the extra calories to make milk for her kittens. Feed her kitten food, which has more calories than adult cat food.\n5. Let Mom do most of the clean-ups. Instinct helps the mother to keep the nest clean. The newborn kittens do not urinate or defecate on their own, so the mother has to lick their bottoms before and after feeding to stimulate elimination. This way she keeps the nest clean. Try to disturb the nest as little as possible. If the bedding becomes soiled, wait until Mom hops out for a toilet break herself to take out the dirty bedding and pop in clean.\n6. Check that the kittens are all nursing. If the mother cat is present, the kittens should nurse from her immediately after the last kitten is born. Newborn kittens will spend most of their time sleeping, waking up to nurse every two to three hours. If they do not appear to be nursing, or one kitten is being pushed away from the mother cat by its siblings, supplement with bottle feeding as described in Part 2.\n7. Consider spaying the mother cat. Having your mother cat spayed (removing her womb) after the kittens are done nursing (they should be weaned by about 8 weeks) is highly recommended by veterinarians and humane organizations. This helps prevent the suffering of unwanted kittens, and can also have some health benefits for the spayed cat. Be aware that a cat can potentially fall pregnant again as little as three to four days after giving birth, so keep her indoors to avoid this risk.\n8. Start to think about deworming the kittens. This can happen as early as two weeks if necessary. Consult a veterinarian for proper medication and dosing.\n\n\n## Care for orphan kitten (0 to 4 weeks)\n\n1. Feed the kittens a milk replacement. Powdered cat milk replacer (such as Cimicat) can be purchased from the vet clinic, major pet stores, or on the Internet. Another good milk replacer is KMR. This is the cat equivalent of infant formula, with the same composition as queen's (mother's) milk. The milk replacer has guidelines as to how much to feed in each meal. Do not feed cow's milk to the kitten as the lactose is likely to upset the kitten's stomach. If you have no milk replacement and a hungry kitten, offer some cooled boiled water in a dropper or syringe until you can get to the vet clinic or pet store. The water keeps the kitten hydrated and won't upset her tummy.\n2. Use a kitten feeding bottle with a specially designed kitten teat. You can purchase this at a vet clinic, a major pet store, or on the Internet. In an emergency use an eyedropper or a small syringe to drip the milk replacement into the kitten's mouth.\n3. Burp the kittens after each meal. You do this much as you would a baby: hold the kitten up straight against your shoulder, or place one hand under its belly. Gently pat and rub its back.\n4. Stimulate the kittens to eliminate. Before and after each feed, wipe the kitten's bottom with a paper towel or gauze pad soaked in warm water. This stimulates the kitten to go to the toilet, which otherwise she would not do. Hold the kitten over a litter box and use the towel to rub the kitten's genitals and anal region after every meal. Continue to do this until the urination and defecation is over (when nothing else is coming out). Rub in just one direction\u2013rubbing back and forth is irritating. Cotton balls or pads are not recommended because they shed.\n5. Look for signs of healthy elimination. Urine should be pale yellow and odorless, and stools should be yellowish-brown, formed in tiny logs. Dark, pungent urine is a sign of dehydration; green stool may be a sign of over-feeding, while white stool could indicate malabsorption, a serious problem. Call your vet if you have any concerns. If the kitten does not urinate for 12 hours, take her to the vet's immediately. Most kittens poop once a day, but individual schedules vary. Take her to the vet's if she hasn't pooped in more than two days.\n6. Follow the kittens' meal times. In the first two weeks of life the kitten feeds every two to three hours around the clock. The kitten will tell you she is hungry by crying and wriggling around as if hunting for a nipple. A full kitten often falls asleep while suckling and has a rounded belly. After two weeks, the feeds can be stretched out to to every three to four hours, with a gap of six hours overnight.\n7. Keep the kittens warm with a covered heating pad. Neonatal kittens (under two weeks of age) cannot regulate their body temperature and usually keep warm by snuggling up to their mother. You can simulate this situation by keeping them on a heated pad designed for puppies or kittens. Avoid putting them in direct contact with the pad: if the kitten is in direct contact with the heat pad, she might be at risk of either local burns or overheating. However, these pads usually come in a fleece cover so it shouldn't be a problem, except for when you remove the cover for washing, in which case substitute a towel. As the kitten gets older (over two weeks), she is able to move away from the heat if she gets too hot.\n8. Never feed a cold kitten. If a kitten's body feels cold, you need to warm her up gradually. A kitten is cold if her ears and/or the pads of her feet feel chilly to the touch. Put your finger in her mouth: if it feels cold, the kitten's body temperature is too low, which can be life-threatening. Warm her up slowly by wrapping her in a fleece blanket and holding her next to your body, rubbing her gently with your hands for one to two hours.\n9. Learn more about taking care of orphaned kittens. You can start with this article. Contact a veterinarian for information and suggestions. Your vet can also provide vaccinations against common diseases and deworm the kittens. Orphaned kittens may be dewormed starting at two weeks, and, depending on their situation, can be vaccinated starting anywhere from two to eight weeks. They may have weaker immune systems because, unlike other kittens, they don't get the antibodies from their mother's milk.\n\n\n## Wean and socialize your kitten (4 - 8 weeks)\n\n1. Start to leave out extra kitten food. If Mom's around, the weaning process (switching from mother's milk to solid food) happens naturally from about four weeks. At this point, Mom gets tired of the kittens chewing on her teats and starts to spend time apart from them. In turn, the hungry kittens investigate food options around them and usually discover Mom's food. As the kittens start to take mouthfuls of her food, they begin the weaning process.\n2. Provide water. Kittens do not need water until they start weaning, roughly around four weeks old. Any kitten above this age, however, should have constant access to a full water bowl. Change this water whenever it gets dirty (as it tends to if kittens step and/or poop in the bowl).\n3. Put down kitten food for hand-reared kittens. If you've been bottle-feeding the kittens yourself, the weaning process is similar. It sometimes helps to put some milk-replacer in a saucer and put your finger just beneath the surface to teach the kitten to lap first. Then, it's a matter of mashing up some wet kitten food with the milk-replacer to make a porridge for the kitten to lap. As she gets the hang of that you can thicken up the porridge until she's happily taking most of her calories in solid form.\n4. Socialize your kittens by introducing them to new things. Socialization is crucial during the three-to-nine-week window. From two to three weeks of age, handle the kittens as much as possible every day. Introduce them to different sights and sounds, such as the vacuum cleaner, hair dryer, men with beards, children . . . anything you can think of. During this six-week window the kitten is most open to new experiences, and what she encounters now she will accept without question as an adult, making her into a happy, well-adjusted and sociable cat. Use cat toys, balls, string, or other objects to play with them, but don't use objects small enough for them to swallow. (Note that cats may eat string or yarn if left unsupervised, so only allow this in your interactive play. It's a potential choking hazard.) Don't teach your kittens that human fingers and hands are toys, or the kitten may continue to bite and scratch them as an adult.\n5. Provide non-clumping litter. Choose a spot for the litter box carefully, as once used to it, the kittens will probably continue to use that spot. If litter-training the kittens yourself, simply place the kittens there after each meal, or whenever a kitten starts to crouch and scratch the floor in preparation for pooping. Clean the litter box at least once a day, or the kittens may stop using it. Choose a box with low sides so it's easy for the kittens to get in and out. Avoid clumping litter, as kittens may eat the clumps, which could potentially harm their digestion. If a kitten seems like it doesn't want to stay in the litter box, gently take its paws and imitate digging in the litter. Then, provide the kitten with privacy so it can dig a hole, do its business, and cover it up with some litter.\n6. Keep the cat inside until it has all its shots. Once your veterinarian allows it, you can let the cat outside to explore. Make sure you keep a close watch on it until you're sure it knows to return home. Let the kitten outside when it's a bit hungry. Entice it back in by calling its name and showing it food. This will remind your kitten that while outdoors is fun, its final destination will always be your home.\n7. Give kittens away responsibly. If selling or giving away the kittens, you should wait until they are at least eight weeks old, but twelve weeks old is preferred. Take them to a vet and start their shots before they leave you. Always follow-up with the new owners to make sure the kitten is getting her shots and is scheduled to be spayed or neutered. Exchange phone numbers with the new owners so you can confirm your kitten is in good hands, or in case the owners want to return her (at least you can help her find another home).\n\n\n## Take care of an adopt kitten (8 weeks and beyond)\n\n1. Ask the breeder or shelter for a blanket that smells like the kitten's mother and siblings. These smells help to give the kitten comfort while she settles into her new home.\n2. Ask what kind of food the kitten's been eating. Provide this for the first few days so that you don't make too many changes at once. When the kitten has settled in, this is your chance to change her food to one of your choosing, though do it gradually: replace a small quantity of her former food with the new food, increasing the amount slowly over the course of a week. If the kitten is eating dry kibble, leave a bowl out all day. If she is eating wet food, give her small meals every six hours. Continue to feed kitten food, not adult cat food, until one year of age.\n3. Provide water. Kittens above four weeks of age need water, so clean water should always be available. Cats tend to be more interested in water that is not next to their food bowl. Encourage drinking by placing water bowls in different spots through the house.\n4. Introduce the kitten to your house slowly. Expose the kitten to just one room initially: the whole house will be too overwhelming on the first day. Set up a bed (preferably one that has sides and a roof so the kitten feels safe in a nest), with food and water in one corner of the room, and a litter tray in the opposite corner. Show the kitten where her facilities are, and then leave her to rest. It's been a big day for the little kitten so let her adjust and sleep for a few hours.\n5. Give the kitten as much attention as you can. Spend as much time as possible grooming, playing, fussing and interacting with the kitten. This helps her to grow into a well-socialized, friendly adult.\n6. Keep the kitten and your possessions safe. Keep electrical cords and devices out of the kitten's reach to avoid her chewing on them. Child locks may be a wise investment for low cabinets if you have a particularly inquisitive kitten.\n7. Plan a vet visit. At nine weeks old the kitten can have her first vaccination. This is the ideal time for a vet to examine her, worm her and start vaccinations. The basic kitten vaccine includes protection against cat flu and infectious enteritis. There is also the option to vaccinate against feline leukemia.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A dedicated special education teacher or educational psychologist with expertise in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

A commonly encountered problem is how to formulate those for maximum efficiency.\nHow does learning vocabulary through sentences, thus giving context to the used words, compare to learning to recognize words alone?

{"conversations": ["Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20\u00b0C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.", "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp.

{"conversations": ["My cat keeps scratching up my furniture. What are some ways to train her to stop?", "Cats scratch furniture for a variety of reasons, so you'll have to work out why yours is scratching in particular. It's usually because it wants to claw off old nail sheaths, or because it wants to mark its territory. Here are a number of things you can do to train her not to scratch your furniture.\n\nFirst, you can trim her nails regularly. If you trim your cat's nails regularly, then it will be less likely for her to want to scratch because it will be more uncomfortable for her to do so. Plus, it will reduce the damage done by scratching because the claws won't be as sharp.\n\nSecond, you can cover the areas with something unpleasant, like tin foil or double-sided tape. This should discourage her from scratching there, and she'll (hopefully) learn to go to her scratching post instead.\nThird, you can try to redirect her attention when she starts to scratch where she shouldn't. If you catch her in the act, make a loud noise (clapping is good) and she should stop. Then, if you have a scratching post nearby, encourage her to scratch there instead. Give her a treat if she scratches the post, or praise her verbally. She'll learn that scratching the post gets her good things, while scratching the furniture gets her nothing.\n\nFinally, you can try a combination of all of the above. Trim her nails, cover the furniture, and when you catch her scratching the furniture, clap your hands and show her the scratching post.\n\nWith consistent effort, you should be able to break her furniture-scratching habit.

When food grows scarce, hunger strikes, and humans either start fighting for what's left, reducing population to more manageable levels, or migrate to not yet depleted lands - only cases of actual extinction are from island civilizations which cannot readily move. Meanwhile, globally environment stays balanced, and depleted spots are replenished from outside - slowly healing the damage.

{"conversations": ["How to stretch your quads (quadriceps)?", "The quadriceps are a group of four muscles that run down your thighs. Virtually every athletic activity or exercise engages your quads, so it's important for them to be flexible and strong. To maintain healthy quads, stretch them before and after exercise. You can also use yoga to increase the flexibility in your quads, which can make them less prone to injury.\n\n## Warm up your quads\n\n1. Walk or bike for 10 to 15 minutes. A gentle cardio exercise such as walking or biking will get the blood flowing to your quads and make stretching more comfortable. Stretching cold muscles could result in injury. If you're planning on exercising outside in cooler weather, add 5 to 10 minutes to your warm-up time before you start stretching.\n2. Do standing quad stretches before a long run. From a standing position with your knees together, lift one foot and grasp it with your hand. Gently press your foot towards your glutes until you feel a stretch along the front of your thigh. Hold for 10 to 20 seconds, then repeat with the other foot. This stretch can be done both before and after a long run or other physical activity, as part of your warm-up or cool-down. You can also do this stretch while lying on one side. Brace your core to keep your spine in alignment and help stabilize your pelvis.\n3. Add kneeling stretches to target quads and hip flexors. Kneel on the floor on one knee. You may want to rest your knee on a folded towel or mat. Lean forward slightly, with your other foot flat on the floor and your knees at right angles. Lean forward, contracting your core and the glute of the kneeling leg. As you exhale, shift your body forward to stretch your quad and other hip flexor muscles. You can rest your hands on your front thigh for balance and stability. Hold the stretch for a 15-40 seconds, then switch and repeat the stretch with the other leg. Keep your spine neutral and your upper body posture straight. You also want to avoid arching, rounding, or flattening your lower back or pulling back against the lean.\n4. Use lunges for dynamic stretching. Stand with your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart and step one foot forward. Lower your body by bending at the knees until the back knee is nearly at the floor. Your front knee should be in line with your ankle so that your shin is perpendicular to the floor. Raise up and repeat with the other side. You can do a series of lunges where you gradually move forward, or you can stay in the same place. Start with 2 sets of 10 repetitions on each leg. If you have trouble balancing and feel wobbly, place your hands on your hips or extend them out to form a T-shape.\n\n\n## Stretch tight or injure quads\n\n1. Use active range of motion exercises to maintain knee mobility. To complete this stretch, bend and straighten your knee through its full range of motion, or as far as you can go without discomfort. You can do this stretch while standing, sitting, or lying down. Choose the position that provides you the most stability and allows you to move your knee the most. This stretch is best soon after an injury, when your movement may be at its most limited. Try to complete 10 repetitions with each leg, but don't overdo it. Stop if you feel pain.\n2. Find a partner for passive quad stretches. Either standing, sitting, or reclining, have your partner grasp your ankle or foot. Your partner will slowly bend and straighten your knee through its full range of motion. When your knee is fully bent, have them hold the stretch for a few seconds before slowly moving your foot back down. Passive quad stretches are a good way to stretch your quads if you don't have the control needed to do standing quad stretches on your own. If you're able to move on your own, passive quad stretches may be of little benefit to you. Communication is key with passive stretching. Don't let your partner push your leg to the point that you feel pain in the muscle. This could lead to additional tearing or re-injury.\n3. Relieve tightness with the couch stretch. Kneel with one knee on the ground in front of a couch. Brace the foot of your kneeling leg on the side of the couch. Your other leg should be straight out in front of you with your knee at a right angle and your shin perpendicular to the ground. Push your hips backward as you press your raised heel towards your glute. You can place your hands on your front knee for balance. Hold the stretch for a few seconds or breath cycles, then release and repeat the stretch with the other leg. In addition to a couch, you can also use a wall or low bench to lean your foot against.\n4. Increase stability and control with supine squats. You will need a stability ball for this exercise. Sit on the ball, then walk your feet forward as you gradually lean back at the same time. When you are lying face up, roll forward and allow your knees to move over your toes until your knees are fully flexed. Then contract your quads and roll back until your knees are at 90-degree angles. Try to do 10 repetitions of this exercise. Only go as far as you can without pain or discomfort.\n\n\n## Improve quad flexibility\n\n1. Lengthen your quads with the crescent lunge. From a standing position, step one foot forward and fold over so that your hands are on either side of your foot. Your front knee should be at a right angle with your shin perpendicular to the floor. Raise up on an inhale, sweeping your arms out to the side and overhead. Lower your hips and press downward into the lunge, stretching and lengthening your quads. Breathe deeply and hold the lunge for 30 seconds to a minute. To get out of the pose, lower your hands over your front leg and then walk or jump your front leg back to meet the other leg. You can raise your hips into downward facing dog if you like, then walk or jump the other leg to the front and repeat the lunge on the other side.\n2. Lower into hero pose. Kneel on the floor, touching your inner knees together. Your feet should be slightly wider than your hips with the tops of your feet on the floor. Exhale and lower your hips onto the floor between your feet until your buttocks are resting comfortably on the floor. Lean forward slightly as you lower, wedging your thumbs into the backs of your knees. Breathe deeply, feeling the stretch in your quads, for 30 seconds to a minute. Open your shoulders and drop your shoulder blades down alongside your spine. If you can't sit comfortably on the floor in this position, place a block to sit on, or roll up a blanket or towel.\n3. Stretch your thighs and core with bow pose. Lie face-down on your mat with your arms by your sides, palms up. On an exhale, bend your knees and raise your feet towards your buttocks. Reach back and grab either your ankles or the tops of your feet and pull them forward. As you inhale, lift your feet towards the ceiling as you raise your thighs off the floor. Breathing can be difficult in this position, but gaze forward and focus on breathing as deeply as you can. Hold the pose for 20 to 30 seconds, then slowly release to lay back down. You can use a folded blanket to pad your ribs and hips to make the pose more comfortable.\n4. Open your hip flexors with pigeon pose. Start on all fours with your knees below your hips and wrists below your shoulders. Slide your right knee forward to the back of your right wrist as you pull your foot around to the left side. The side of your right shin should be lying on the mat perpendicular to your torso. Then slide your left leg back until it is flat on the floor. Exhale and raise up so you are in a sitting position with your right leg crossed in front of you and your left leg extending backwards. Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Then return to all fours and repeat with your left leg in front and your right leg extended behind you. There are many variations to this pose. For example, try folding over your front leg and resting your chest and forehead on the mat for a more intense hip opener. For a really deep quad stretch, raise your back foot towards your buttocks. Grab your back foot or ankle with your hand and press it towards your buttocks to further deepen the stretch.\n5. Bend into camel pose. Kneel with your legs about hip-width apart. Inhale and draw your elbows towards each other behind your body, allowing your sternum to lift and your rib cage to expand. Press your hands into your heels, maintaining the lifting in your sternum and keeping your shoulders back. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Avoid tightening your glutes. Camel pose helps lengthen and improve flexibility in your hip flexors and upper quads. If it is too much of a challenge for you to reach your heels, you might place a block between your feet or lean back over an exercise ball.\n6. Extend your backbend with little thunderbolt pose. Once you're comfortable in camel pose, take it a step further by lowering your head until the crown of your head rests between your feet. Reach your arms forward to grasp your lower thighs. Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. To come out of the pose, engage the core and slowly roll yourself back up to a kneeling position. Keep your glutes soft to avoid excess pressure on your lower back. This pose opens up your hips and quads. The practice of lifting up with your chest as you lower your torso backwards is an intense workout for your thighs.\n7. Rest in child's pose. Still in a kneeling position, spread your knees slightly and bring your big toes together. On an exhale, fold over your thighs, extending your arms out overhead and resting your forehead on the floor. Breathe deeply in this position for as long as you want. In addition to being a relaxing way to end your practice, child's pose also works as a good counter-pose after backbends.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A fitness enthusiast or an individual seeking to improve their physical fitness.

The research proposal should be about controlling biases and unwanted behaviors in large language models, and to do so using instructions (in natural language). Let's start by drafting an abstract and an introduction.", "Here is the abstract and introduction of a research proposal about controlling biases and unwanted behaviors in large language models:\n\n\n#Controlling Biases in Large Language Models\n\n\n##Abstract\n\nWhile large language models are unlocking previously unimaginable applications, their extensive usage also exacerbates the risk of generating toxic text that amplifies adverse biases in the training data. We propose utilizing the newfound instruction understanding abilities of large language models to identify, explain, and mitigate undesirable biases in text. Our research plan begins with a novel method for eliciting natural language explanations of why a particular text is harmful, without any training data or definition of what constitutes toxic text. We then propose to investigate whether explicitly instructing models to avoid biases using natural language prompts can steer them away from unwanted outputs. Finally, we aim to explore a more permanent solution by fine-tuning the model on anti-harm instructions (behavioral guidelines, codes of conduct, diversity training), and thus informing it on which utterances should be avoided. Successfully tuning large language models to better align with acceptable behavior will dramatically advance the ability to deploy safer, fairer models in real-world settings.\n\n\n##Introduction\n\nLanguage models, the cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP), are known to reflect and even amplify biases in training corpora, often resulting in racist, sexist, and generally toxic outputs. Susceptibility to such harmful biases hinders the deployment of these models and limits their applicability.\n\nA common approach for developing safer models is to try to control the training corpora. [Citations], for example, used a list of banned words to filter potentially harmful text from the C4 corpus. This simple approach fails to remove all adverse biases from the text, as toxic content can be written using words that are, by themselves, benign. Another technique for corpus intervention is data augmentation [Citations], which adds a counterfactual example for each utterance of a potentially biased text. This technique, however, only applies when counterfactual swaps are possible, e.g. gender, and it requires prior knowledge of all potential biases in the training corpus. Data augmentation enlarges an already oversized corpus, and can often create artificial and even unrealistic texts if not done carefully. Finally, various approaches perform post-training debiasing [Citations], but these often result in significant performance degradation on downstream tasks.\n\nWe propose explaining and mitigating adverse biases via natural language instructions. Our plan includes three parts:\n*  Inducing natural language explanations of adverse biases in a given text. We intend to build on our recent work on instruction induction [Citations], and prompt language models to describe \u201cin their own words\u201d whether a given text is problematic and why.\n*  Controlling the manifestation of model biases during generation by prompting language models with explicit instructions. We plan to investigate the use of both model-generated explanations and existing guidelines written for humans (e.g. code of conduct) to reduce and control adverse biases during inference.\n*  Mitigating adverse biases in the model itself by fine-tuning on behavioral guidelines. The goal is to efficiently adapt the model itself so that it (permanently) generates less harmful content. We build on recent work which shows that fine-tuning on task instructions (instruction tuning) improves the zero-shot learning abilities of language models [Citations]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has utilized this framework for teaching models what behaviors should be avoided. The success of instruction tuning suggests that our approach is viable, and we hope it can accelerate the progress towards safer, fairer models."], "source": "authors", "questioner": "A computer science professor with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP).

{"conversations": ["How to keep a dog hydrated?", "Water is essential for your dog\u2019s digestion, circulation, waste filtering, and body temperature. Your dog should drink about one ounce of water for every pound of weight on a daily basis, though they may need more if they are exercising or if it\u2019s hot outside. To ensure your dog stays hydrated, invest in a quality water bowl and make sure you are hydrating your dog effectively at home and on the go. If you think your pup is experiencing dehydration, bring them to the vet right away. Dehydration can be life threatening if it goes untreated.\n\n## Use a quality water bowl\n\n1. Get a water bowl that is the right size for your dog. Make sure your dog\u2019s water bowl is the right size for them, as a bowl that is too big or too small will limit their access to water. Check that the water bowl is made for a small, medium, or large dog. Get the size that will make it easy for your pup to bend down and drink from the bowl. For example, tall, narrow bowls are ideal for dogs with long ears, such as Bassets and Spaniels. This can help to keep their ears out of the bowl, which can reduce the risk of ear infections. Smaller dogs do well with a water bowl that is low and shallow, as this will make it easier for them to drink from the bowl. A bowl that is big and wide is ideal for medium to large dogs.\n2. Buy a weighted water bowl. A weighted water bowl will have a heavier bottom, making them less likely to tip over. This may be a good investment if you are worried about your dog tipping over their water bowl or moving the bowl around and spilling the water while they drink. Look for weighted water bowls online or at your local pet store. Test the water bowl before you give it to your dog to use. Fill it with water and tap or try to tip one side of the bowl. A weighted water bowl should make it harder to do this.\n3. Invest in a water fountain. Larger dogs and dogs who are picky about their water may benefit from a water fountain. Most water fountains will filter and recirculate the water so it is fresh and tastes delicious to your dog. You can buy water fountains online or at your local pet store.\n\n\n## Hydrate your dog at home\n\n1. Fill your dog\u2019s water bowl daily. Make sure you keep your dog\u2019s water bowl filled with fresh water on a daily basis. Fill it up first thing in the morning when you give your dog their breakfast. Then, check their water bowl throughout the day to make sure it is full. Fill it up again at dinner time, if it needs refilling. Make sure you toss out any old water from the previous day before you fill it up with fresh water. This will ensure the water tastes good to your dog and is free of bacteria.\n2. Clean their water bowl regularly. Bacteria can end up sitting on the rim of the water bowl and in any water still in the water bowl. Get in the habit of cleaning your dog\u2019s water bowl on a daily basis. Use soap and water to remove any grime or dirt in the bowl or on the rim. Dry the bowl well before you fill it up with fresh water and set it down for your pup. For example, you may clean the bowl first thing in the morning before filling it up with fresh water. This way, it will stay clean for the rest of the day until you clean it again the following morning.\n3. Place water bowls for your dog throughout your home. If your dog likes to roam through your home, make sure you have water sources located throughout the space for them. Put water bowls on each floor of your home. Set up water fountains in several spots in your house so your dog always has access to fresh water. Doing this will ensure your dog never gets dehydrated. Make sure you clean all of your dog\u2019s water sources in your home on a daily basis. This will ensure they do not get dirty or contract any bacteria.\n4. Keep the toilet seat down in your home. Prevent your dog from drinking from the toilet bowl by keeping the seat down at all times. The water in your toilet bowl likely contains bacteria and other pathogens that are harmful to dogs. Keeping the seat down will make it difficult for your dog to access the toilet bowl water. It will also encourage them to drink the fresh, clean water from their water bowl instead. If your dog really enjoys drinking from the toilet, consider purchasing a ceramic bowl for them that will mimic the type of \u201cbowl\u201d your toilet is.\n5. Switch your dog to wet food. To encourage your dog to stay hydrated, consider switching from dry dog food to wet dog food. Wet dog food contains more water and can help your dog stay hydrated. Add water to their wet food at a 1:1 ratio to help your dog drink more water. You can also try giving your dog two wet food meals and one dry food meal a day. Wet dog food can be more expensive than dry food and requires more preparation time, so this may be a good option if you\u2019re short on time and money. If your dog will eat all of their dry food at one time, you can try adding water to the dry food. Many dogs will consume all of the dog food as well as the water.\n\n\n## Hydrate your dog on the go\n\n1. Bring bottled water on walks or long trips. Dogs can often get dehydrated when they are out for a long walk or running around outside during a play session. Long car trips can also make your dog thirsty, especially if it is a hot day. Pack bottled water or water jugs and your dog\u2019s water bowl so you can provide fresh water for them on the go. Some dogs can be trained to drink from a squirt bottle. Try to get your dog used to drinking from a squirt bottle so you can bring it with you when you go on a walk or to a dog park. This will make it easier for you to squirt water into your dog\u2019s mouth if they start to get dehydrated. You can also purchase a portable, collapsible dog bowl to take with you on the go.\n2. Give your dog ice cubes as treats. Ice cubes are often a fun treat for dogs and can help them stay hydrated. Use ice cubes as a reward when your dog does a trick or follows an obedience command. Pack a cooler of ice cubes on a long trips and give them to your dog periodically to ensure they stay hydrated. To make the ice cubes more appetizing, you can try putting a dog treat in water in the ice cube tray and freeze it overnight. This way, your dog can lick the water, working their way to the treat inside the ice cube.\n3. Do not keep your dog tied up outside. Try not to keep your dog chained or tied up outside, especially on hot days. Dogs can end up wrapping their chain or leash around poles or trees, make it impossible for them to access their water bowls. Do not leave your dog tied up unattended for prolonged periods of time. If you do need to keep your dog contained, put them in their crate or kennel with access to a water bottle or a water bowl. This way, they will still be able to access fresh water.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A manager or team leader who is transitioning their team to a remote work environment.

{"conversations": ["How to identify a bandwagon fan?", "Ever notice how people \"suddenly\" become fans of teams that are performing well? Do you ever wonder if they are \"real fans\" like they claim to be? Or do you wonder if they're just bandwagon fans? Bandwagon fans are defined as sports fans who have shown no past loyalty to a team, and who only support them when they are doing well. While people may not admit to being bandwagon fans, there are easy ways to spot them.\n\n## Listen to what they say\n\n1. See if they know the staff. True fans of a team will know the names of more than just the star player on the team. See if they know other players, coaches, owners, and former players. This will help determine if they have any loyalty towards the team. Knowing the play-makers is great. But a true fan needs to know more than the offensive players. They need to know what's going on on both sides of the ball. Not every fan follows what goes on behind the scenes so cut them some slack if they don't know the athletic trainer or the newest draft picks.\n2. Determine if they know statistics. Knowing statistics takes both time and effort. Do they know the average number of points scored per game? Do they know where the team ranks offensively and defensively? True fans always find ways to track the progress of their favorite team. Their knowledge should go beyond stats for the star player or the team's record. They should be able to discuss the teams status as if they were commentators for ESPN, because it is both informative and entertaining for real fans.\n3. See if they know any historical information about the team. It's easy to know about a team's current progress, but it's more difficult to know about the history of a team. A fan who has been loyal for years will know past players, championship years, and significant games. Many fans will also have personal stories associated with the team. For example, they'll know exactly where they were when the Houston Rockets won back-to-back championships in 1994 and 1995. Many bandwagon fans only follow teams who have been successful over the last few years and will not know history that stretches beyond the team's current winning streak.\n4. Count how many teams they support. Fake fans usually divide their loyalty among more than one team. The more teams they support, the less of a true fan they are. Choosing a favorite sports team is like choosing a wife--you can only have one. In different sports, there are rules about teams you cannot support at the same time. For example, in baseball, you can't root for both the Yankees and the Mets. In football, you can't cheer for both the Texans and the Cowboys.\n5. Listen to their reasons for supporting the team. Most of the time loyalty to a team is determined by where you grew up or the player you idolized growing up. Bandwagon fans usually have flimsy excuses for why they support a team. For example, reasons such as liking the team logo, having a boyfriend or girlfriend that supports the team, or picking the team are not viable reasons. If your favorite team relocates to a different city then it is your choice to turn back on them or not. If you grew up in a city that didn't have a team for a specific sport, you're then able to pick a team (with good reason of course). If your team eventually gets a new franchise, it is your choice to stick with your current team, or start to follow the new one.\n6. See if they only support the best teams in the league. If the fan only supports the #1 teams in football, baseball, basketball, soccer or other major league sports, they are likely not supporting the team but supporting the winning streak. There will be times when your favorite team will consistently be successful, but it's a strange phenomenon when ALL of the teams you support are doing well. For example, it's perfectly acceptable to support the New England Patriots and their success. But to support them, the Boston Red Sox, the Golden State Warriors, and the Washington Capitals at the same time is a sign of being a bandwagon fan.\n\n\n## Watch what they do\n\n1. Notice if they go to games only when the team is successful. It's difficult to support a team when they are in a slump, but real fans do just that. Even if a real fan curses their team, they are there to support them the next game. Bandwagon fans jump off the wagon at the first sign of trouble. Going to a game takes more effort and more money. Bandwagon fans don't want to invest either if the team isn't doing well. The same is true of watching games on television.\n2. Ask why they leave the game early. True fans stay at a game until the bitter end--even if they know the result will be less than desirable. On the other hand, bandwagon fans tend to walk out and stop offering support to the team. Bandwagon fans often miss out on some of the best comebacks in sports because they choose to walk out during tough times. For example, in the 2013 NBA Finals in game six when the Miami Heat were down against the San Antonio Spurs, fans left early and missed out on a comeback. Also, in the NFC Championship Game between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks, they trailed so fans left the game early and missed out on an amazing onside kick recovery to eventually win the game and go to Super Bowl XLIX.\n3. Determine if they go to live games. If you don't cheer for the team in the area you grew up in, in favor of a team far away, that's one thing. But true fans still go to live sporting events for the experience of being around like-minded, passionate individuals. Bandwagon fans don't value the experience because they aren't as emotionally invested as real fans. Even if it means braving the cold or paying for over-priced beer, real fans will try to attend at least one game during the season. Some bandwagon fans will attend a game or two just to be able to say that they have. They are unlikely to attend games that aren't convenient. For example, when the weather is bad, when the tickets are too pricey, or when the game falls on a workday.\n4. See if they support the team only during playoffs. This has a bit to do with the team being successful, but it also has to do with the importance of the game. Regular seasons in sports tend to be long and grueling, so bandwagon fans like to skip the regular season games and jump right to the good part. Playoff games occur after the regular season and are tournament style games that lead up to the championship. Playoffs also bring out bandwagon fans whose \"first choice\" didn't make the playoffs. In order to have someone to root for, they will choose a team randomly and only for that season.\n5. Determine if they jump off the wagon. This is also known as wavering in their support of the team. If a fan stops supporting their team if they lose a playoff game, championship game, or don't make the playoffs at all, they're exhibiting behavior consistent with that of a bandwagon fan.\n\n\n## Identify a true fan\n\n1. See if they own a throwback jersey. A throwback jersey is one that duplicates a jersey worn by a team or player from the past. Real fans tend to purchase throwback jerseys (along side more modern sports gear) because they actually know the history of the team and its players. On the contrary, bandwagon fans typically purchase team gear that represents the more modern logos, colors, and players. True fans are also more likely to spend big bucks on team gear and throwbacks are usually more authentic and costly.\n2. Notice if they ever boo their team. True fans will never boo their team because they are trying to inspire them, not make them feel worse. It's okay to be angry with a less than perfect performance, but making your team feel like trash won't help. Real fans stick with their team for better or for worse.\n3. Determine if they support their team's players more than any others. A true fan's loyalty is always to his or her team first. That doesn't mean that they can't support or like other players, but it does mean that their loyalty lies with their team's players first. For example, it's fine to appreciate great players like Peyton Manning but if you're a New England Patriots fan you support Tom Brady first. Additionally, if you have players who are on your fantasy football team but are not on your favorite football team, you can support them only as far as it doesn't interfere with your favorite team's success.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An investor, financial analyst, or economist with a keen interest in understanding market trends and identifying potential risks.

{"conversations": ["How do weather models work?", "All numerical atmospheric models are built around calculations derived from primitive equations that describe atmospheric flow. Vilhelm Bjerknes discovered the relationships and thereby became the father of numerical weather prediction. Conceptually, the equations can be thought of as describing how a parcel of air would move in relationship to its surroundings. For instance, we learn at a young age that hot air rises. The hydrostatic vertical momentum equation explains why and quantifies under what condictions hot air would stop rising. (As the air rises it expands and cools until it reaches hydrostatic equilibrium.) The other equations consider other types of motion and heat transfer.\n\nUnfortunately, the equations are nonlinear, which means that you can't simply plug in a few numbers and get useful results. Instead, weather models are simulations which divide the atmosphere into three-dimensional grids and calculate how matter and energy will flow from one cube of space into another during discrete time increments. Actual atmospheric flow is continuous, not discrete, so by necessity the models are approximations. Different models make different approximations appropriate to their specific purpose.\n\nNumerical models have been improving over time for several reasons:\n\n* More and better input data,\n* Tighter grids, and\n* Better approximations.\n\nIncreasing computational power has allowed models to use smaller grid boxes. However, the number of computations increases exponentially with the number of boxes and the process suffers diminishing returns. On the input end of things, more and better sensors improve the accuracy of the initial conditions of the model. Synoptic scale and mesoscale models take input from General Circulation Models, which helps set reasonable intial conditions. On the output end, Model Output Statistics do a remarkable job of estimating local weather by comparing the current model state with historical data of times when the model showed similar results. Finally, ensemble models take the output of several models as input and produce a range of possibly outcomes."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A meteorologist, climate scientist, or a student with an interest in meteorology and atmospheric sciences.

{"conversations": ["What is the LXX and why is it so noteworthy that there is a Greek translation of the OT? Wouldn't it be better to directly reference manuscripts in the original languages?", "Before 1947, a good case could be made that the Septuagint represented a more ancient tradition than the Masoretic versions of the Tanakh.  Since the Septuagint was produced before 132 BCE (and probably in the 3rd century BCE) and the earliest known Masoretic manuscripts date to the 10th century CE, the Greek translation might have fossilized an early rendering of the Scriptures while the Hebrew continued to be copied and potentially altered.  To further support the primacy of the Septuagint, the early Christian and Hellenistic Jewish texts, tended to use that translation rather go back to Hebrew sources.\nAn interesting counter-argument arises from the observation that during the 600 years from Jerome's translation into Latin (the Vulgate) to the earliest Masoretic manuscripts, the Hebrew seems to have been faithfully copied.  That suggests that Jewish scribes were exceptionally careful to duplicate their scriptures.\nAfter 1947, the evidence changed.  According to Wikipedia:\n\n  [Most] of the Qumran fragments can be classified as being closer to the Masoretic text than to any other text group that has survived. According to Lawrence Schiffman, 60% can be classed as being of proto-Masoretic type, and a further 20% Qumran style with bases in proto-Masoretic texts, compared to 5% proto-Samaritan type, 5% Septuagintal type, and 10% non-aligned. Joseph Fitzmyer noted the following regarding the findings at Qumran Cave 4 in particular: \"Such ancient recensional forms of Old Testament books bear witness to an unsuspected textual diversity that once existed; these texts merit far greater study and attention than they have been accorded till now. Thus, the differences in the Septuagint are no longer considered the result of a poor or tendentious attempt to translate the Hebrew into the Greek; rather they testify to a different pre-Christian form of the Hebrew text\".\n\nAnother another article describes the meaning of the categories in detail.\nA few caveats are in order:\n\n* Surveying the Qumran about religious texts seems something akin to surveying a hippie commune about political issues&mdash;you're likely to experience some bias.  If we could obtain a similar collection from Jerusalem, we'd likely find more agreement and likely the side of MT.  Given the diversity in non-Scriptural texts, 60% seems quite solid support.\n* While it's unlikely, there exists a chronological possibility the scrolls associated with the Septuagint-aligned Hebrew were influenced by the Greek.  (Any references one way or the other would be appreciated.) \n\nWhat remains therefore is a window into the community of Alexandrian Jews that produced the translation.  For those who are interested in the development of Jewish belief, that can be extremely useful.  N. T. Wright's book, The Resurrection of the Son of God, shows that the LXX translators chose to interpret key texts from Daniel and Ezekiel about the resurrection as literal rather than metaphorical.

{"conversations": ["How to drive economically?", "Everyone needs to use a car from time to time, but gas can be expensive. Driving more economically can save you money and keep your car\u2019s parts from wearing quickly. By avoiding aggressive driving, managing gears and electronics, and performing regular maintenance, you can drive more economically no matter where you\u2019re going.\n\n## Avoid aggressive drive\n\n1. Brake in a controlled manner. Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you\u2019ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don\u2019t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel.\n2. Accelerate smoothly. Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money.\n3. Minimize distractions. Whether you\u2019re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions. Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It\u2019s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.\n\n\n## Manage gear and electronics\n\n1. Use air conditioning wisely. At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way.\n2. Cut down on electronics. Your car\u2019s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren\u2019t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings.\n3. Use your gears effectively. Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car\u2019s engine. To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration. While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently. Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you\u2019re new to the technique.\n\n\n## Perform routine maintenance\n\n1. Check your tire pressure regularly. Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently.\n2. Use the right specification of engine oil. Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner\u2019s manual.\n3. Get your car serviced regularly. Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.\n\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Pack light. Bringing extra luggage or hauling large items requires more gas to get your car from place to place. Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle.\n2. Map your journey. Getting lost certainly won\u2019t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you\u2019re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient.\n3. Carpool when possible. Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You\u2019ll also save your car from more wear and tear.\n4. Combine errands. Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start \u201ccold\u201d less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally-focused individual, possibly a commuter or car owner, looking for ways to minimize their environmental impact while still maintaining a budget-friendly driving experience.

{"conversations": ["How to get around st. louis on the cheap?", "Whether you're traveling around St. Louis on vacation, visiting the area on business or live in the metro area, there are several ways to get around St. Louis on the cheap. The city's bus, train or van metro system are among the cheapest ways to get around. Another good note is that if you're visiting the dowtown STL area during the week, there are often \"City Guide\" personnel roaming (either on bike or foot), that will assist with any directions.\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Use St. Louis area maps to make getting around easier and cheaper. The St. Louis Convention and Visitor's Commission offers several downtown, metro and area maps that can help you plan your visit.\n2. Use the trip planner on the St. Louis Metro Transit website to plan the easiest and least costly routes around the city. The planner can help you choose between taking a taxi, the MetroBus or MetroLink train.\n\n\n## Ride the metrolink\n\n1. Purchase MetroLink tickets at vending machines in MetroLink stations. You can buy tickets or weekly and monthly passes with cash or a credit card. You can also purchase passes at the downtown St. Louis MetroRide store or online at the St. Louis Metro website. Buy either a 1-hour, 2-hour or 1-day pass for the MetroLink system. Two-hour and day passes also give you access to the MetroBus system while traveling in St. Louis. Passes start at just $2 for adults.\n2. Choose which MetroLink line you need to take to reach your destination. The MetroLink operates a Red Line between the Lambert Airport in Missouri and the Shiloh-Scott Station in Illinois. The Blue Line operates between the Shrewsbury-Lansdowne I-44 stop in Missouri and a station in Fairview Heights, Illinois.\n\n\n## Ride the metrobus\n\n1. Plan a MetroBus route. You can travel from Illinois to Missouri via MetroBus routes. The system's stops include many of the city's major attractions, like the civic center, Laclede's Landing and Busch Stadium. Use the MetroBus schedule to help find the best route to your destination before purchasing your tickets. Some routes may be quickest and less expensive if you combine a ride on the MetroBus with the MetroLink.\n2. Pay your MetroBus fare with exact change as you board, or purchase a MetroBus pass or tickets ahead of time at the MetroRide store in downtown St. Louis or online. If you'll be using both MetroLink and MetroBus, consider buying a combo fare pass at the store to save money.\n\n\n## Use the metro call-a-ride service\n\n1. Call for door-to-door transportation service in many areas of the city through the Metro Call-a-ride program. The service is available as a link to the MetroBus or MetroLink services, or from other designated locations. Call-a-Ride rates start at $13.\n2. Consider using the Metro Call-A-Ride if you or anyone in your party has a disability. The ride program is available for those who qualify for the Americans With Disabilities Act at a reduced rate starting at $4.\n3. Call 314-652-3617 or toll free 888-652-3617, up to a week in advance to reserve curb-side service from Metro Call-A-Ride.

{"conversations": ["How to be a domestic goddess?", "Being a domestic goddess has distinct advantages, regardless of whether you live alone or serve as the matron of a big family. If you lack cleaning, cooking, and sewing skills, learning to master these tasks may seem intimidating. The key is to start small and avoid overwhelming yourself. With time and patience, you can polish your skills to goddess level.\n\n## Part one: chores and home maintenance\n\n1. Set a daily routine. There are a handful of chores you should do each day if you want to maintain a clean and clutter-free domestic heaven. Thankfully, these chores are quick enough to squeeze in even if you work a job outside of the home or have a houseful of kids to attend to. To reduce your stress as much as possible, plan on accomplishing each of these daily chores during a certain time of the day. Organizing your time may help you relieve some of the anxiety you feel about getting everything done. Daily tasks you'll need to make time for include making the bed, sorting the mail, and sweeping or vacuuming the floor. Other daily tasks should be performed as you go along. These include putting things away (to prevent clutter from developing), cleaning up as you cook, and wiping up fresh spills.\n2. Make a weekly schedule. Some chores only need to be done once or twice a week. Instead of rushing around to get these chores done all at once, plan on doing a little each day and set aside certain days for certain tasks. You'll likely feel more relaxed about getting things done, which means you'll do a better, more thorough job. Clean the bathrooms once a week. Make sure that you wash all bath linens and scrub all toilets, tubs, and sinks. Empty the trash, clean the mirrors, dust the lights, and wipe up the floor. The bedrooms in your home also need a thorough weekly cleaning. Put away anything that has been sitting out on a desk or side table. Clean all sheets, pillowcases, and blankets. Empty the trash, dust all the surfaces, and vacuum the floor. You may need to vacuum your living room, kitchen, and dining room every day or two, but other chores, like dusting, washing rugs/mats, and wiping mirrors, can be done once a week.\n3. Experiment with different cleaning products. Not every household cleaner is just as good as every other. Moreover, different types of cleaners may work better on different areas of your home. If there is some part of your usual cleaning routine that leaves a lot to be desired, figure out why your current cleaner is not doing the job right and research which options might be better. Compare chemical and organic products. Nowadays, many people prefer cleaning products made from natural ingredients instead of chemical cleaners. Natural cleaners have their own pros and cons, just as chemical cleaners have, but it doesn't hurt to include a few organic products among those you plan on testing out. Ask your friends for suggestions or do some research online about your different options. Test a few different products out on a trial basis. Pay close attention to which products work best with different materials\u2014wood, glass, ceramic, plastic, and so on.\n4. Be handy. The modern domestic goddess needs to know a bit more about the handy side of home care than earlier counterparts did. You don't need to know how to maintain all the systems and utilities in your home, but learning how to take care of a few basic projects is a wise move. At minimum, your home tool kit should contain a hammer and a few different screwdrivers. These tools will allow you to do simple tasks like hanging pictures and making small repairs to things like toys, cabinets, and drawers.\n5. Organize your realm. Clutter is the natural enemy of any domestic goddess. If you want to maintain a living space that any mortal would be envious of, you need to keep things orderly and in their place. Brush up on space-saving techniques and similar skills to keep your belongings in check. This is especially important if you're dealing with limited space. Get rid of any unnecessary junk first, then organize everything that has a purpose in a way that makes sense based on your needs.\n6. Master the laundry. Laundry is one chore that you will never be able to avoid if you want to be a domestic goddess. Your current laundry skills might be adequate, but you should still continue to watch out for aspects of your laundry routine that could stand to use improvement. Consider assigning different laundry tasks to different days, as well. For instance, you can clean bathroom towels on Tuesday, bed sheets and pillowcases on Wednesday, and any other miscellaneous towels or blankets on Thursday. Clothing will need to be cleaned throughout the week, though. Read the labels before you wash something and follow the laundering instructions provided. If you aren't sure whether or not an item will bleed color in the washing machine, test it by soaking a small spot and blotting that spot with a white cloth. Wash colors and whites separately. Also separate heavily soiled items and wash those on their own. Pretreat stains and presoak heavily soiled garments in a sink or bucket of water for 30 minutes before washing them. Use the recommended amount of detergent and select the best washer cycle for each individual load. Base water temperature and dryer settings on color and fabric type. Materials that can shrink should be washed in warm or cold water and air dried, for instance. Cold water is best for bright colors, while hot water works well for whites.\n7. Learn a few tricks. Once you've mastered the basics, keep an eye out for various tips and tricks that can take your home skills from \u201cgreat\u201d to \u201camazing.\u201d Some tricks work better than others, though, so you should test them out before bragging to your friends about your newfound knowledge. For instance, cover dirty stroller wheels and wagon wheels with plastic shower caps before bringing the item inside. Wrap pipe cleaners around the neck of condiment bottles to catch drips and prevent crusty build-up. Stuff holes in the wall and cabinets with steel wool to keep mice and other pests out.\n\n\n## Part two: in the kitchen\n\n1. Get off to an easy start. If you currently have some cooking and baking knowledge, then you're off to a good start already. If not, start small by making simple meals and following easy recipes. You can gradually build up your kitchen skills as you get more comfortable, but trying too much all at once is a good way to fail and get discouraged. Look for books specifically aimed at beginners or search for easy recipes online. Instructions that provide step-by-step pictures are often the easiest to follow along.\n2. Take a class. Look for free and cheap cooking classes in your area. Focus on developing skills that you're specifically interested in developing, and skip any class that will teach you something you already know or will teach you something you have no desire to learn. Local craft stores often offer classes on baking and food decorating. Small markets may have classes on cooking essentials. Check out cooking schools in your area. Even if you don't want to spend time and money on a cooking program, some of these schools offer one-time cooking courses at a discounted price.\n3. Find your niche. Not every domestic goddess needs to love cooking, but learning to enjoy it can motivate you into improving your skills. Try to find something about cooking or baking that you can feel passionate\u2014or at least interested\u2014about. Build up your cooking skills in general, but involve your point of interest as much as possible while doing so. Your passion might be something simple, like baking cookies or mastering stovetop cooking. On the other hand, you might find your attention grabbed by something a little more unique, like gluten-free baking or canning.\n4. Make any necessary adjustments. You might have a full set of cooking and baking skills when all is said and done, but that doesn't mean you will be able to show them all off each and every day. Know when to make a simple meal and when to whip up something more impressive. Learning how to use your cooking to improve and please those you're cooking for is another skill you will need to master. For example, if you're cooking for picky kids, focus on choosing kid-friendly meals instead of trying to impress them with an elaborate meal they won't even eat. When you're cooking for guests, find out about any food allergies or special diets ahead of time and plan your menu accordingly.\n5. Experiment. Once you feel comfortable enough in the kitchen, start using the skills and knowledge you have gained to experiment with your own recipes and tasty creations. Some experiments might be a success while others will likely be a failure. The important thing is simply to keep working at it until your successes vastly outnumber your failures.\n\n\n## Part three: sew and other \"lost\" skills\n\n1. Master the basics of sewing. Sewing is the queen of lost skills, so if you don't know even the most basic stitches, you really aren't alone. At minimum, though, you should know how to sew hems, repair small rips and tears, and attach buttons. Learn a variety of basic stitches, including the straight stitch, the back stitch, the zigzag stitch, and the basting stitch. Invest in a sewing machine. As your sewing skills improve, consider buying a sewing machine of your own. You will probably be glad that you did. Fixing garments and creating projects from scratch will both be much easier if you learn to machine sew as well as hand sew.\n2. Get crafty. Sewing is not the only lost skill worth learning, of course. There is a wide range of other crafts and domestic abilities you can explore. You do not need to master all of them, but picking one or two you'd like to become great at can improve your standing as a domestic goddess. Potential areas of interest could include gardening, crocheting, or knitting. You could also check out community craft websites, like Pinterest, to get more ideas.\n3. Take classes. You can learn a lot by teaching yourself, but sometimes, the best way to learn a new skill or to advance an old one is to take an actual class on it. Look for cheap classes in your area or sign up for a class online.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally conscious individual who is passionate about sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint.

{"conversations": ["Would a bullet made from ice be capable of killing somebody at 100 metres before melting?", "The short answer is probably no.\nIt would either shatter because of the amount of force the weapon puts on it or melt because of the heat (in case of a regular combustion gun). The former has more chance of happening, before the ice even has the time to start melting.\nThe only way to shoot it without shattering it nor melting it, at least using weapons available to us, would be to use compressed air weapons, but it would need to be significantly powered down to prevent the bullet from shattering, so it would probably not be powerful enough to cause damage.\nThe force needed to break through one square inch of ice is roughly 400 pounds on average. The bullet you're trying to fire is probably 9mm, but let's just calculate as though it was about one square inch (although it's actually quite smaller than that): those 400 pounds equal roughly 1800N.\nThe force that comes out of a 9mm gun is approximately 383 ft-lbs, which equals to 520 newtons per metre. That amount is about 52000N per centimetre. One inch is about 2 and a half centimeters, so that means it's more about 20'800N per inch. As you can see, it's a lot more than what it takes to break ice.\nAs for the \"wall\" towards which something has to be pushed in order to break it, the air will fulfill the role: the atmospheric pressure is about 15 pounds per square inch: it doesn't seem like a lot, but in the time it takes the bullet to win this force and gain momentum, it gets shattered by the enormous amount of energy produced by the weapon.", "what makes you think it would shatter? The force distribution over the back end of the projectile should be fairly even, so i don't quite see that happening. Also, the barrel holds it together while the force is applied.", "The fact is that a bullet made of ice is significantly less elastic than a regular one, and it wouldn't be able to dissipate the thrust force fast enough. A lead bullet (or whatever metal) gets deformed by the explosion (and gets compressed) and, due do the elasticity of metal, goes back to its original shape. An ice bullet, instead, would not modify its structure and, in the first few milliseconds after the gun is fired, the bullet will be shut between the power of the explosion and the pressure of the air coming from outside the barrel, and without being able to compress, it will shatter."], "source": "multi_turn", "questioner": "A curious and inquisitive individual with an interest in physics and materials science, particularly their real-world applications.

Crochet with the new yarn leaving the knot in place. To ensure that the yarn is secured seamlessly into your work, begin working the next stitch in your pattern using the new strand of yarn. Do not untie the knot after you work the stitch. For example, if you are doing a single crochet stitch, insert the hook into the next stitch, and yarn over. However, instead of yarning over with your old yarn, yarn over with the new strand. Then, pull this yarn through the stitch, yarn over again, and pull through 2 to complete the stitch.\n3. Cut the old yarn and untie the knot after working a row. After you have crocheted 1 row past where you joined the yarn, untie the knot connecting the new strand to the old strand. Then, cut the old yarn to the same length as the new yarn, if needed. If the old yarn is already the same length as the new yarn, then don\u2019t cut it.\n4. Weave in the ends with a yarn needle. Thread the end of the new yarn through a yarn needle. Then, insert the yarn needle into the stitch nearest its base. Sew all the way through the stitch, and bring the needle back through the next stitch on the other side of the item. Repeat this until you cannot sew any further, then cut the excess yarn about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the surface of the crocheted item. Repeat the same process to weave in the other strand of yarn.\n\n\n## Cross and double for a no-weave connection\n\n1. Cross the old and new yarn about 3 in (7.6 cm) from their ends. Match up the ends of the new and old yarn. Then, pinch the 2 pieces about 3 in (7.6 cm) from their ends. Twist the pieces around each other 1 time so that they are crossed. Make sure to crochet until you have 6 in (15 cm) left on your current ball of yarn. This will provide enough slack to join the yarn strands.Tip: Try this technique if you don\u2019t want to weave in any ends and you don\u2019t mind doubling up the yarn for a small section.\n2. Cross the strands and hold onto the end of the old strand. Grasp the end of the strand of old yarn and bring it towards the stitch that is currently on the hook. Hold it in place with your thumb. Then, grasp the end of the new yarn and pull it in the opposite direction so that it is doubled over and laying flat. This will allow you to crochet to the very end of the old yarn and pick up the new yarn without any loose ends to weave in later.\n3. Crochet with the doubled over yarn strands. Continue crocheting according to your pattern or stitch. Work the doubled over strands of yarn as you would work a single strand of yarn. Hold the end of the new yarn with your thumb until you have crocheted over this section. Be careful not to pull too hard on either strand of yarn as you crochet this section, or the strand might get disconnected and you will have to start over.\n\n\n## Create a no-weave knot\n\n1. Pinch the new and old yarn 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the ends. Take the end of your old yarn and the end of your new yarn and line up the ends so that they are even. Then, pinch the ends between your non-dominant thumb and forefinger to hold them in place. Make sure that the ends of the yarn strands are poking out past your fingertips.Tip: Use this option if you want to keep the yarn in a single strand without having any ends to weave in later.\n2. Wrap the new yarn around your thumb 2 times. Use your other hand to grasp the new yarn extending from your forefinger and thumb and wrap it around your thumb and the pinched yarn ends. Make sure that the yarn goes in between your forefinger and thumb as well, but on the outside of the pinched yarn ends. Leave the old yarn alone as you do this. Just let it hang loose and don\u2019t wrap it around anything!\n3. Bring the new yarn back between your thumb and the ends of yarn. After wrapping the yarn around your thumb for the second time, bring the strand back in the opposite direction. Pull it so it goes between your thumb and the 2 ends of yarn instead of around them. Make sure to keep pinching the ends of the yarn as you do this!\n4. Tuck the ends of the yarn down towards your thumb. Use the index finger on your dominant hand to tuck the ends of the 2 strands down over the new yarn. This is the strand that you just pulled between your thumb and the ends. Push the ends down so that they are completely folded over. If you find it hard to tuck the yarn down with your finger, use your crochet hook to tuck it down.\n5. Pull gently on the new yarn and allow the loops to slip off your thumb. Continue to pinch the yarn between your finger and thumb, and use your other hand to start tugging gently on the new yarn. Tug until the first loop tightens and slips off your thumb, and then keep pulling to tighten the other 2 loops into a knot around the end of the old yarn. The ends of the yarn should be joined in a tight knot after you pull off the last loop. You can continue crocheting as you normally would once the ends are joined!\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A beginner or intermediate crocheter seeking to expand their skills and learn a new technique.

{"conversations": ["I am writing a story where a species undergoes devolution. Is there any scientific or plausible way to do this? The process can be instantaneous or may take ages, I do not mind which as I need to weigh my options at this stage. \nTo be clear, the devolution I am thinking of is like taking a human being then devolving him/her to the primate stage, so lets say about as far back as Orrorin tugenensis or Paranthropus where they are in the midst of evolving from primates to Homo erectus. Please note I used human beings as an example to give context but the species undergoing devolution may not necessarily be human.\nBased on the answers, \"devolution\" does not exist so had the word in quotes to reflect this. ", "Devolution doesn't really ever occur, organisms simply adapt to best suit their environment over time. A good example is cave dwelling Troglodyte type species that have lost the ability to see. They haven't actually devolved to not have eyes, they simply did not need them and evolved to save valuable energy and nutrients by not growing a sight organ that would be useless in their environment. It isn't devolution, it's still evolution since they are changing to better suit their environment. So, at least as far as natural processes go, a species would need to become stuck in an environment for a few hundred thousand years that heavily discourages intellect, sociability, communication skills, culture, and inventiveness. That's a tough one to come up with since such traits are usually the most powerful ones for surviving something.\n\nSo here's the environment and scenario I'm thinking of. Your smart guy race is in the stone age, its pretty much on par with homo sapiens and where they were at about 10,000-15,000 years ago. But something catastrophic doesn't happen. The world slowly becomes a perfect Eden with very few predators, a perfect climate, and vast endless fields of grain and forests of fruit bearing trees. No ice age, no super-predators like we saw in said ice age. No famines or depredation, no rabid competition between several human subspecies for the same resources. The planet (Henceforth known as paradise) is literally perfect. Too perfect. Why would a species that has as close as possible to absolutely nothing to worry about need to even develop the ability to worry? Those big craniums and complex brains waste space and make childbirth more dangerous than necessary. There is absolutely nothing gained by possessing speech, abstract thought, or cooperative culture when all a species needs to do to be successful is to wander around placidly in small familial groups grazing mindlessly on the limitless amounts of food. Shelter is utterly not necessary since you have a perfect climate, nor is clothing, and food is so ludicrously plentiful there is no need to make tools.

{"conversations": ["How to become hot?", "Being hot is more than just a look\u2014it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you\u2019ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don\u2019t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today\u2019s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you\u2019re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you\u2019ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don\u2019t forget how much you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you\u2019ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don\u2019t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that\u2019s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don\u2019t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the \u201cperfect\u201d body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts \u2013 instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You\u2019ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There\u2019s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can\u2019t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you\u2019re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they\u2019re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men\u2019s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you\u2019d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate amount of skin. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it\u2019s not surprising when people can\u2019t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it\u2019s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It\u2019s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer\u2019s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body\u2019s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn\u2019t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren\u2019t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It\u2019s easy to start slumping forward when you\u2019re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they\u2019re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It\u2019s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It\u2019s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don\u2019t try so hard. Or at least look like you\u2019re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you\u2019re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It\u2019s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It\u2019s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you\u2019re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone\u2019s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don\u2019t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they\u2019re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental scientist, sustainability consultant, or eco-conscious individual with a keen interest in climate change mitigation strategies.

More precisely, every $2$-clause $l_1 \\lor l_2$ can be understood as a pair of implications: $\\lnot l_1 \\Rightarrow l_2$ and $\\lnot l_2 \\Rightarrow l_1$. If you set $a$ to true, $b$ must be true as well. If you set $b$ to false, $a$ must be false as well. Such implications are straightforward: there is no choice, you have only $1$ possibility, there is no room for case-multiplication. You can just follow every possible implication chain, and see if you ever derive both $\\lnot l$ from $l$ and $l$ from $\\lnot l$: if you do for some $l$, then the 2-SAT formula is unsatisfiable, otherwise it is satisfiable. It is the case that the number of possible implication chains is polynomially bounded in the size of the input formula.\nWith $3$-SAT, you can express implications of the form $a \\Rightarrow b \\lor c$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are literals.

Here is where case-multiplication becomes possible, and where the combinatorial explosion arises.\nIn other words, $3$-SAT is able to express the presence of more than one possibility, while $2$-SAT doesn't have such ability.

{"conversations": ["How to create a strong burning charcoal fire?", "It may seem intimidating to start and maintain a strong fire, especially when charcoal is involved. However, with some basic equipment and knowledge of charcoal, anyone can have a professional BBQ going!\n\n## Use a chimney starter\n\n1. Use a chimney starter for an even, strong fire with minimal effort. Chimney starters are the easiest way to get a good charcoal fire, and you won't need any lighter fluid, either. You put paper in the bottom, fill the rest of the chimney with charcoal, and light the paper on fire. The heat is contained in the chimney, allowing all the charcoal to quickly catch fire before you dump it onto the grill to use for cooking. Chimney starters are usually between $15-$30, depending on size, and can be found online or in hardware stores. Most professional BBQ chefs and cooks highly recommend buying a chimney starter, as lighter fluid can influence smoke flavor and is harder to use when making an even heat fire.\n2. Place 2-4 pieces of lightly scrunched newspaper in the bottom of the starter. You only need to ball the paper up loosely, as having it too tight can prevent the flame from getting enough oxygen. The paper will act like a rapid, large match for your charcoal, starting the fire. If your chimney doesn't have a solid bottom, place the paper on the charcoal grate of your grill and lower the chimney on top of it.\n3. Fill the top of the chimney with charcoal briquets or wood chips. Fill the entire chimney up with your favorite charcoal, or a mixture of both. Use enough charcoal for your entire grill, as the chimney will ensure that everything is evenly lit. For a normal, 22\" grill this means roughly 40 briquets, but simply filling your chimney to the top should be a close enough estimate.\n4. Light the paper from the bottom in 2-3 places. Use long matches or a grill lighter to protect your hands. The paper will burn up quickly, but the concentrated flames and hot air will ignite the bottom charcoal, which will then light the rest of the chimney. Place your chimney on the charcoal grate of the grill or a heat-resistant surface as it heats up. It will get very hot, and can cause a fire if left unattended.\n5. Dump the coals on the grill the top pieces are covered in gray/white ash. As the heat rises in the chimney, the coals on top will catch and start to coat with white/gray ash. It usually takes 10-15 minutes to get hot enough. You are then ready to start grilling. Dump the coals in the center of the grill if you plan on keeping the whole grill surface hot, or on one-half of the grill if you want separate areas for direct and indirect cooking. If you plan to grill for more than a half hour then add several handfuls of charcoal now so that they catch as they others begin to fade..\n6. Make sure the vents are open for a larger fire. Open vents send more air and oxygen to the fire, helping it grow quickly. Keep the lid open as you position the coals and sear anything your want to grill, then close it to smoke the meat or cook it more slowly.\n\n\n## Use lighter fluid\n\n1. Open the bottom vents of your grill and remove the cooking grate. Get rid of the cooking grate, set the top aside, and open the bottom vents of the grill. You want as much air as possible to get to your charcoal in order to start an even, strong burning fire. Clean out any ash now, as it will smother your fire and keep the charcoal from lighting evenly.\n2. Form a \"pyramid\" of charcoal briquettes, with the peak in the center of the grill. Aim the opening of the bag into the center of the grill when dumping out the briquettes to naturally form a pyramid. Then use your hands or a pair of long-handled tongs to stack any other pieces of charcoal along the sides on the pyramid. Start with roughly half the number of briquettes outlined below to start your grill. Once it's hot, add charcoal, 5-7 piece at a time, to get the grill up to full strength. For a small, portable grill, you want 25-30 briquettes, or pieces of charcoal, when you start cooking. For a medium to average sized grill, you'll want roughly 40 briquettes. For a large or industrial grill, you will need 1 bag or more of charcoal to cook.\n3. Squirt a small amount of lighter fluid in the center of your pyramid. You don't want to drench your charcoal in the fluid, as it takes a while to burn and will make a thick, unappetizing smoke. Simply squirt the fluid for no more than a count of \"2 Mississippi\" around the center of the pyramid, trying to get the fluid in the middle. You can also start your pyramid, douse the inner briquets with fluid, then pile the \"top\" of the pyramid above the lighter fluid soaked briquets to make sure the whole pile gets hot. A mistake that many grillers make is using too much lighter fluid, which then imparts a petroleum-like tinge to the taste of their food. You do not need a lot of fluid, just enough to get a few pieces of charcoal smoking. These pieces will then help the rest of the pile catch.\n4. Let the briquettes with lighter fluid soak for 2-3 minutes. Do not light the grill immediately. Waiting allows the lighter fluid to soak into the top layer of charcoal, helping it to burn evenly.\n5. Apply a thin second layer of lighter fluid. Lightly squirt the pyramid with a few bursts of lighter fluid in several places, only letting it soak in for a few seconds. This is what will \"catch,\" so you don't want to drown the charcoal in fluid or you risk a dangerous flair up. You just want a few little areas of fluid to start your fire.\n6. Light the fire safely with a long match or electric lighter. Though lighter fluid is not made to flare up, it should still be treated with respect. Light the pile in 2-3 places where you put the lighter fluid, aiming to get the middle of the pile lit where possible. The fire will likely start large, with big flames leaping around the charcoals, but this is just the lighter fluid burning. Once the flames die down, the center of the pile should be smoking and developing white/gray coloring. This means your fire has caught.\n7. Spread the briquettes out once they are mostly covered in gray/white ash. Once you can barely see any black, the fire is ready for cooking. The inner coals of your pyramid should be glowing red. Spread the coals in your desired pattern, adding more if you plan on grilling for a long time. As a general rule of thumb, you should add a handful or two of coals every 30 minutes if you plan on continuing to grill. You want 1-2 layers of charcoal over your entire grilling area, not patches of charcoal or solitary, exposed coals. Charcoal maintains heat by staying clustered together, much like ice in a pack stays cold longer than separated cubes. If you've added charcoal, wait 5-6 minutes for them to catch. Since the heat of the rest of the charcoals is already hot enough, it should not take long.\n8. Seal up any unused briquets for next time. Use a clip to seal the top of the bag if you have leftovers in the bag. The additives in the charcoal will evaporate, making them harder to light next time with or without lighter fluid.\n\n\n## Build and keep a strong fire\n\n1. Pack your charcoals together for strong, direct heat. As you cook, use your tongs to keep the charcoals together, as solitary briquettes will quickly lose heat and do little to keep your fire going. You do not want them so well packed that they can't get air, but you also don't want them separated like many little islands.There are two styles of charcoal placement, depending on how you plan to cook:\n\t* \n\t* Even Grilling: Coat the entire bottom surface of the grill with two layers of charcoal. This allows the whole grill to reach a consistent, even temperature. If you're cooking food quickly and don't need any indirect heat (for large, slow-cooking cuts of meat), this is the way to go. Two-Zone Grilling: Shuffle all of the charcoals into an even pile on half of the grill, leaving the other half bare. This lets you cook foods quickly, directly over the charcoals, but also allows you to cook slower cuts by indirect heat on the opposite side of the grill. You can also keep already cooked food warm, on the empty side of the grill, or smoke them with grill top on.\n2. Add coals regularly to keep your grill burning hot. Don't wait until you're almost out of briquets to add more. Instead, add 5-10 pieces of charcoal when you have roughly half of your charcoals remaining, usually every 30 minutes. Wait 5-10 minutes while the new charcoal ignites and begins to get a white/gray coat on the outside before you resume cooking. If you feel like you need more coals, add them. More coals mean a hotter burning grill. Add slowly, putting on 5-6 at a time, until your grill reaches your desired heat.\n3. Keep the top and bottom vents open to get the hottest temperature. The more air you get to the fire, the hotter it will cook, so opening the vents is key to a hot, strong burning charcoal fire. The more oxygen you give to the flames. the hotter your grill will be. If you need to control the temperature, close one or both of the vents partially. Closing both of them at once can suffocate your fire and extinguish it. Closing the upper vent is also useful for smoking, as it lowers the temperature of the fire and traps the smoke in the grill around your food.\n4. Empty the ash frequently. There is a small lever that lets you open and close the bottom vents on your grill, and this same lever can be used to remove ash through the vents. Ash takes up space for air and will smother the coals as it builds up.\n5. Adding hardwood charcoal for added flavor and greater heat. Wood burns hotter than briquettes, leading to a smokier flavor and an easier sear. It also burns faster than briquettes, however, leading many cooks to use a combination of the two. This allows you to keep the fire burning for longer but still get a hot, smokey fire going to sear steaks or larger cuts or meat.

{"conversations": ["How to respond to unsolicited advice?", "When someone gives you unsolicited advice, it can be tricky to know how to respond, no matter how well-intentioned it is. You don't want to hurt their feelings, but you also may not want to leave room for further advice. Sometimes, all you can do is politely acknowledge the advice and move forward. In other cases, however, you may need to shut the advice-giver down for crossing a boundary, or even leave the conversation.\n\n## Keep your cool\n\n1. Try to remember that the person is probably just trying to be helpful. They may not realize when they overstep their bounds, and they might hope that you will genuinely benefit from their advice. Sometimes, unsolicited advice just means that the person cares about you and wants to make your life easier. It is easy to take unsolicited advice as criticism. While this can be true, take their perspective into account and try to see if they are offering genuine, yet misguided support.\n2. Take a moment to put yourself in the other person's shoes. While it does not excuse their rude behavior, keep in mind that people often give unsolicited advice because they feel the need to be heard, or because it's what they're used to receiving from other people. Think about what may have led this person to share a piece of advice you did not need. Some examples of experiences that might lead someone to give unsolicited advice are feeling unheard while growing up, going through a difficult time and projecting their own problems onto you, or they feel undermined in other areas of their life and give advice to feel more competent. In other cases, the person may feel more powerful by giving advice that no one asked for, or they may be overconfident in their abilities. Gender is another factor, as men tend to give women more unsolicited advice, often as a result of undervaluing their skills.\n3. Maintain a sense of humor. It\u2019s often easiest to smile or laugh off unsolicited advice. By having a sense of humor about the situation, you can put yourself in the right frame of mind to shrug off the comment. For small, harmless suggestions, especially from strangers, put the situation in perspective and let your humor guide your response. Think about how the situation will make a funny story to tell your friends later, or how absurd it is for someone to think you might not know how to do a simple task. You can convey good-natured humor in your response out of politeness, even when you find the suggestion silly or ignorant. By saying something like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a great idea! Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d you may be enabling them to continue to offer unprompted advice, but it can help you avoid conflict.\n4. Avoid the impulse to lash out. It is easy to feel defensive when you receive unsolicited advice, in part because it can feel like the other person doesn\u2019t trust you to handle things themselves. Sarcasm and criticism can make the person who gave you advice feel victimized, however, as they most likely won\u2019t see what they did wrong. Think about your relationship with the person. Especially if they are a friend or family member, you may not want to upset them. When interacting with a stranger, it can be easy to be dismissive or rude, but try responding in a firm, yet polite way if laughing off the advice doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\n## Move on with the conversation\n\n1. Hear the advice-giver out. In many cases, the person just wants to feel heard or contribute to the conversation. Let them say their piece, even if it's unhelpful or completely wrong. They'll probably feel better once they finish talking and often just stop. Once they have finished, the conversation can move on.\n2. Acknowledge the advice and move on. Sometimes the easiest thing to do is nod, smile, say okay, and go ahead with your plans anyway. Particularly if the person is in a position of power, you might feel obligated to thank them before moving forward or changing the subject. \"Thank you. I'll consider that.\" \"Let me write that down so I can think it over.\" \"I already have a plan for handling this, but thank you for your perspective. I'll take it into consideration.\"\n3. Turn it into a joke about yourself. A little humor can turn around an awkward situation. If you think of something silly to say, try saying it out loud. The two of you might be able to have a good laugh and move on. \"If you think my desk is messy, you should see my bedroom. Some of my clothes have probably fossilized by now.\" \"You know me. I love carbs far too much to change my diet.\" \"I would, but my husband banned me from the kitchen after the second time I set myself on fire.\"\n4. Address their motive, if they have one. Sometimes people who give advice have an ulterior motive (for better or for worse). If you can tell that an advice-giver is hoping you'll do something that makes them happy, try offering an alternative or addressing it directly. \"Are you trying to make an excuse to spend more time with me? Because you don't need one! Are you free this weekend?\" \"I know that it's been a big change since I moved away from home. I enjoy living in the city, so I plan to stay there. Why don't we set some dates for you to come visit?\"\n5. Ask a question to switch to a new topic. Changing the subject by asking a question can be a good way to distract a person who was piling on advice. Try asking about them, or about something you know they're interested in. This way, they're likely to stay engaged in the new topic. \"I'll keep that in mind. But enough about me. How was your day?\" \"My partner and I are going to make all our birthing decisions together. Do you know of any good parent and me classes?\" \"Thanks for the advice! You mentioned having two dogs. What are their names?\"\n6. Turn down the advice politely if the person doesn't get the hint.. Try to keep it positive by saying that it isn't right for you personally, while acknowledging that it could be right for them or someone else. This will help the other person realize that they gave advice you didn\u2019t ask for. \"Thank you for trying to help, but I may have given the wrong impression. I'm not looking for advice right now.\" \"I've tried that, but I found that it doesn't help me personally.\" \"I'll make treatment decisions with my doctor.\" \"That's not in line with my personal values.\"\n\n\n## Confront the advice-giver\n\n1. Express your discomfort if the advice-giver crosses a line. Sometimes, people say things that are downright rude, mean, or overly familiar. In that case, you may want to tell them that they've offended you or hurt your feelings. Try to make \"I\" statements (e.g. \"I'm upset\") instead of a \"you\" statement (e.g. \"you're rude\") so that you don't put them on the defensive. One way to shut down a piece of unwanted advice would be to say, \"I feel upset about this line of conversation. Let's please change the subject.\"\n2. Set a boundary with a regular advice-giver. If someone is repeatedly trying to give advice when it's not what you want, you may want to express your frustration in a constructive way. You can set a boundary in the conversation, or in general, if the person has a track record of offering unsolicited advice. For a specific instance of needing to set a boundary you could say, \"I know you're trying to help, but I really just need a listening ear right now,\" or simply \"I'm not looking for advice at the moment.\" If someone has been giving you unsolicited advice for weeks, months, or years, try saying something like, \u201cI often feel like you try to help in ways that show you don\u2019t trust me to help myself,\u201d or \u201cI will ask for advice if I need to, but I need you to let me talk about this without trying to help.\u201d\n3. Exit the conversation if needed. Sometimes people pile on unsolicited advice despite your attempts to redirect the conversation or set a boundary. In these situations, it may be easier to leave the conversation for a minute or end the conversation altogether. \"Please excuse me. I remembered\u2026 \"\n\t* \"I need to get going now so I'm not late.\" \"I need to get to an appointment. It was nice talking to you!\"\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A professional seeking to improve their interpersonal skills and navigate workplace dynamics, particularly in situations where they receive unsolicited advice.

It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries. And it creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production.\nSo in most cases, protecting the environment and promoting economic growth go hand-in-hand.

{"conversations": ["How to be organized during the holidays?", "## Personal holiday organization\n\n1. Plan for sleep. One of the dangers of the holiday season is that you schedule too much and don't budget enough time for sleep and exercise. These 2 practices can cut your stress level in half and make it easier to stay on task during your holiday rush. It is common to reduce your exercise time slightly during the holidays, but try to get about 30 minutes of mid-intensity cardiovascular exercise 5 times per week. Don't not cut down on your sleep; aim for 8 hours per night. Moderate your alcohol intake. Although it may seem like a sedative, it can actually prevent you from getting deep sleep. Stop after a few drinks to avoid losing your energy the next day.\n2. Set a budget 2 months before the holidays. Take into account how much you can afford and then split the money between cards, postage stamps, gifts, decorations, clothing, food and even a party. Plan an overage of 10 percent in your budget. This means all of your needs should add up to 90 percent of the money you have for the holidays.\n3. Sit down with your family 6 weeks before the holiday and ask for help. If you love control, this may be hard to do; however, it will take a load off your shoulders and make everyone feel like the holidays don't come together magically.\n4. Discuss the possibility of doing a low-gift giving Christmas or a charity project with your family. If your budget is tight, then giving 1 present or buying 1 big present for the whole family might be better. Studies have also shown that charity projects can help your emotional health during stressful times.\n5. Book travel plans 3 or more months before the holidays. Ticket prices tend to go up right before the holidays. Make sure you have lower travel costs and less stress associated with travel if you and your children or parents have their plans figured out in advance.\n6. Use a calendar that everyone can see, online or in the house. Place all commitments, deadlines, family nights and tasks on it so that everyone can refer back to it over the month of December.\n\n\n## Holiday shop organization\n\n1. Schedule shopping intelligently rather than in blocks. The following are good tips that make holiday shopping more effective and quick:\n\t* Buy things throughout the year, whenever you see something that is ideal for someone. You provide more thoughtful gifts if they are catered to the person, rather than bought frantically the month before. Store your gifts in 1 place in your house and come back to your gift hiding place 6 weeks before Chanukah or Christmas. Take a few hours off work during mid-week once the holiday sales start. You will miss the rush and have a more calm shopping experience. Shop in small spurts online. Getting online for hours can be a waste of time. Keep a list in your purse of things you are looking for, and add to it. Wait until you have 2 or 3 things you know you want to search for and do your power shopping. Open 3 browser tabs and compare prices on Amazon, Overtock.com and a Google Shopping page. Don't be afraid to give gift certificates. Many stores, massage parlors, movie theaters and more provide gift certificates. Think of something that your friends or family will find truly valuable over a product you are unsure they will like.\n2. Set up a wrapping station on a table in late November or early December. Wrap gifts as soon as you bring them home. This will remove the chance that children will find their gifts and it will allow you to get both shopping and wrapping done at a slow and steady pace.\n3. Aim to finish your shopping and wrapping by December 15th. Schedule your time accordingly, so that you can enjoy the holidays and be ready for any last-minute changes.\n\n\n## Holiday cook organization\n\n1. Clean your kitchen from top to bottom before attempting holiday baking or cooking. Try to do this in late November or early December. Rearrange things that overnight guests will need, such as coffee and cereal, in an easy to reach cupboard and create a baking cupboard.\n2. Stock up on baking supplies early in the season. Buy flour, sugar and spices at warehouse stores so that you don't have to make late night runs to the supermarket. Buy some pre-made pie crusts and cookies to keep around in case you don't have time to do everything from scratch.\n3. Bake throughout the holiday season. Clear out your freezer, and then create a cooking to do list that allows you to make and freeze items every week. For example, bake 1 sweet, such as cookies or candy, and prepare 1 side dish in preparation. Cover and label the dishes very well before you stack them on a freezer. For example, \"Sweet Potatoes. Thaw and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.\"\n4. Plan a holiday potluck party instead of baking all of the food. This is a great way to lower your budget and have fun.

In this article we'll see several alternatives to one time usage of rolls of wrapping paper for gifts.\n\n## Reuse wrap paper\n\n1. Wrap the gift in such a way as to promote reuse: When selecting wrapping paper, select paper which is durable. When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.\n2. Unwrap the gift for reuse, too. When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper. Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.\n3. Share the paper with several guests. If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.\n\n\n## Use gift bag with a gift tag\n\n1. Purchase a nice gift bag (or reusable bag), rather than wrapping paper for each gift.\n2. Make and attach a large gift tag to the bottom of the bag covering the manufacturers name, etc. Include at least 12 rows on the tag. Write your name, email, occasion and date on the first row of the tag.\n3. Place gift item in bag and present to honoree as usual. After honoree removes the gift from the bag, they save the bag for the next occasion.\n4. When the honoree has an occasion to give a gift, they write their name, occasion and date on the first blank line on the tag.\n5. Repeat the re-use and gifting process 12 times.\n6. Have the twelfth person to receive the gift bag send an email to everyone listed on the tag with the bag's history. Assuming the bag remains in usable condition, they can then attach a new tag on top of the original tag and repeat the process.\n7. Keep the reuse and gifting chain going until the back is too worn to continue. Ultimately, recycle the bag.\n\n\n## Make a gift display rather than gift wrap\n\n1. Bring unwrapped gifts to the celebration.\n2. Place the gifts on a display table. Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.\n3. Prepare a one page log for the honoree. It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift.

After typing the country code, the number you have dialed may look something like 0011+971+X+XXX-XXXX.\n3. Include the area code for the city you wish to call in the UAE. Like in a lot of countries, the UAE is divided up into service regions. Major UAE cities like Dubai are covered by single-digit area codes. For smaller regions like Tarif, the area code is 2 digits long. Find an area code at https://countrycode.org/uae. For example, the area code for Dubai is 4. Dial 2 to reach Abu Dhabi instead. The area code always comes after the country code, so the number you have dialed will look like 0011+971+4+XXX-XXXX. If you see a phone number that begins with 0, leave off the 0 when dialing it. For example, you may see a Dubai number with a 04 area code. The 0 is for domestic calls, so dial it only when you're calling from within the UAE.\n4. Use an area code starting with 5 if you\u2019re calling a mobile number. Mobile numbers have a separate area code no matter where you\u2019re calling. The code you need depends on what service provider the other person has. The only way to figure out someone\u2019s mobile phone number is by asking them or figuring out which service provider they use. Mobile codes are always 2 digits long. For example, numbers covered by Etisalat use 50 or 54. Numbers covered by Du often begin with 52 or 55. If you\u2019re calling a mobile number, dial something like 0011+971+55+XXX-XXXX. Like with landlines, avoid dialing 0 if a phone number starts with it. You only need to dial it when you\u2019re calling domestically.\n5. Type in the phone number to complete the call. Phone numbers in the UAE are 7 digits long, excluding the area code. To complete the call, you will need to ask for that phone number or find it online. The finished phone number will look something like 0011+971+4+XXX-XXX. This number places a call to Dubai from Australia.\n\n\n## Manage fee while call\n\n1. Contact your phone carrier to get a calling plan if you make lots of calls. Notify your phone service provider that you plan on calling the UAE. Ask them about the costs and what plans they have available. Many carriers have monthly plans catering to international callers. If you think you\u2019ll need to make lots of calls, such as when contacting family in the UAE, a prepaid plan can save you a lot of money. Note any fees the phone carrier includes in their terms of service. Calling abroad is often costly, so explore your options before settling on a carrier.\n2. Get a prepaid calling plan if you make few calls. A lot of the major phone carriers offer pay as you go plans. You decide in advance how many minutes you wish to buy. When your minutes are up, you can no longer make calls until you buy more data. Prepaid plans are a great way to place international calls without paying for a monthly plan. Your phone calls are limited to what you pay for, so you do need to manage time wisely. However, using limited data prevents you from overspending on long calls.\n3. Buy calling cards for reduced rates if you make short calls. Order an international calling card online or buy one from a telephone service provider. Read the front of the card to find out how many minutes it contains and what rate it charges. Make sure the card is valid for calls to the United Arab Emirates. When you use the card, dial the number on it before dialing your country\u2019s exit code. Depending on where you live, you may be able to find cards available at supermarkets, convenience stores, and other locations. If you visit the UAE, the country\u2019s telecom companies sell prepaid cards that stay valid even while you\u2019re abroad. Read the fine print on the cards carefully to find out what fees come along with placing calls.\n4. Purchase a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone for frequent calls. Find a service provider that sells VoIP phone plans, such as Vonage. Phones equipped with VoIP technology place calls over the Internet instead of traditional phone lines. As a result, you can place international calls at a reduced rate. If you call the UAE several times a month, VoIP technology is a good investment. Some companies sell phone adapters that allow you to place VoIP calls on your regular phone. Use the adapter to place calls through your computer or landline. The disadvantage of VoIP phones is that you need a stable Internet connection. Using a high-speed connection increases the quality of your calls.\n5. Use a legal Internet app if you wish to make quality video calls. In the UAE, the government sets regulations on what apps its citizens can use for phone calls. Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) apps are common across the world, and the ones used in the UAE are called Botim and C\u2019me. To use these apps, you need to either be connected to Wi-Fi or use your phone\u2019s mobile network. The person you are calling also needs to have the app installed on their device. Botim and C\u2019me charge a monthly fee to access the app, which can get costly for most residents. On the plus side, these apps offer both regular and video calls. As of 2018, apps like Skype and FaceTime are banned in the UAE. This may change in the near future, but for now, the UAE government wants to steer its citizens away from free services.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A traveler or expatriate who is planning a trip to the United Arab Emirates and needs guidance on making international calls.

The materials were discovered while a potential buyer was touring his house. \nAlthough I vehemently condemn the KKK, doesn't this officer have the right to display whatever he wants in his home so long as it doesn't actively and deliberately call for violence? Aren't these articles protected under the first amendment? I realize this is an extreme example, and as a police officer his job requires interacting with all races, but unless it can be shown that he's bigoted and that it negatively affected his job performance, isn't it illegal to fire him? \nEmployers can restrict speech according to company policy while at work, but we all have to go home at some point. Can those restrictions follow us after clocking out? ", "In general, employers in the United States are free to fire you for your speech. The First Amendment does not apply to anyone except the government (other than a narrow set of circumstances where private parties act on behalf of the government or take on government roles, like when private universities employ campus police). If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question -- the answer would clearly be \"no, there is no First Amendment claim here.\" That\u2019s not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment.\nWhat makes this interesting is that the government is involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In Pickering v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can't necessarily fire an employee for speech. Pickering imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee's First Amendment rights is weighed against the government's interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see Pappas v. Giuliani, where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off-duty time.\nAnother answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that's not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job requires maintaining good relations with the community. In Pappas, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A person who values individual rights and freedom of speech, and may hold conservative political views.

{"conversations": ["How to be a domestic goddess?", "Being a domestic goddess has distinct advantages, regardless of whether you live alone or serve as the matron of a big family. If you lack cleaning, cooking, and sewing skills, learning to master these tasks may seem intimidating. The key is to start small and avoid overwhelming yourself. With time and patience, you can polish your skills to goddess level.\n\n## Part one: chores and home maintenance\n\n1. Set a daily routine. There are a handful of chores you should do each day if you want to maintain a clean and clutter-free domestic heaven. Thankfully, these chores are quick enough to squeeze in even if you work a job outside of the home or have a houseful of kids to attend to. To reduce your stress as much as possible, plan on accomplishing each of these daily chores during a certain time of the day. Organizing your time may help you relieve some of the anxiety you feel about getting everything done. Daily tasks you'll need to make time for include making the bed, sorting the mail, and sweeping or vacuuming the floor. Other daily tasks should be performed as you go along. These include putting things away (to prevent clutter from developing), cleaning up as you cook, and wiping up fresh spills.\n2. Make a weekly schedule. Some chores only need to be done once or twice a week. Instead of rushing around to get these chores done all at once, plan on doing a little each day and set aside certain days for certain tasks. You'll likely feel more relaxed about getting things done, which means you'll do a better, more thorough job. Clean the bathrooms once a week. Make sure that you wash all bath linens and scrub all toilets, tubs, and sinks. Empty the trash, clean the mirrors, dust the lights, and wipe up the floor. The bedrooms in your home also need a thorough weekly cleaning. Put away anything that has been sitting out on a desk or side table. Clean all sheets, pillowcases, and blankets. Empty the trash, dust all the surfaces, and vacuum the floor. You may need to vacuum your living room, kitchen, and dining room every day or two, but other chores, like dusting, washing rugs/mats, and wiping mirrors, can be done once a week.\n3. Experiment with different cleaning products. Not every household cleaner is just as good as every other. Moreover, different types of cleaners may work better on different areas of your home. If there is some part of your usual cleaning routine that leaves a lot to be desired, figure out why your current cleaner is not doing the job right and research which options might be better. Compare chemical and organic products. Nowadays, many people prefer cleaning products made from natural ingredients instead of chemical cleaners. Natural cleaners have their own pros and cons, just as chemical cleaners have, but it doesn't hurt to include a few organic products among those you plan on testing out. Ask your friends for suggestions or do some research online about your different options. Test a few different products out on a trial basis. Pay close attention to which products work best with different materials\u2014wood, glass, ceramic, plastic, and so on.\n4. Be handy. The modern domestic goddess needs to know a bit more about the handy side of home care than earlier counterparts did. You don't need to know how to maintain all the systems and utilities in your home, but learning how to take care of a few basic projects is a wise move. At minimum, your home tool kit should contain a hammer and a few different screwdrivers. These tools will allow you to do simple tasks like hanging pictures and making small repairs to things like toys, cabinets, and drawers.\n5. Organize your realm. Clutter is the natural enemy of any domestic goddess. If you want to maintain a living space that any mortal would be envious of, you need to keep things orderly and in their place. Brush up on space-saving techniques and similar skills to keep your belongings in check. This is especially important if you're dealing with limited space. Get rid of any unnecessary junk first, then organize everything that has a purpose in a way that makes sense based on your needs.\n6. Master the laundry. Laundry is one chore that you will never be able to avoid if you want to be a domestic goddess. Your current laundry skills might be adequate, but you should still continue to watch out for aspects of your laundry routine that could stand to use improvement. Consider assigning different laundry tasks to different days, as well. For instance, you can clean bathroom towels on Tuesday, bed sheets and pillowcases on Wednesday, and any other miscellaneous towels or blankets on Thursday. Clothing will need to be cleaned throughout the week, though. Read the labels before you wash something and follow the laundering instructions provided. If you aren't sure whether or not an item will bleed color in the washing machine, test it by soaking a small spot and blotting that spot with a white cloth. Wash colors and whites separately. Also separate heavily soiled items and wash those on their own. Pretreat stains and presoak heavily soiled garments in a sink or bucket of water for 30 minutes before washing them. Use the recommended amount of detergent and select the best washer cycle for each individual load. Base water temperature and dryer settings on color and fabric type. Materials that can shrink should be washed in warm or cold water and air dried, for instance. Cold water is best for bright colors, while hot water works well for whites.\n7. Learn a few tricks. Once you've mastered the basics, keep an eye out for various tips and tricks that can take your home skills from \u201cgreat\u201d to \u201camazing.\u201d Some tricks work better than others, though, so you should test them out before bragging to your friends about your newfound knowledge. For instance, cover dirty stroller wheels and wagon wheels with plastic shower caps before bringing the item inside. Wrap pipe cleaners around the neck of condiment bottles to catch drips and prevent crusty build-up. Stuff holes in the wall and cabinets with steel wool to keep mice and other pests out.\n\n\n## Part two: in the kitchen\n\n1. Get off to an easy start. If you currently have some cooking and baking knowledge, then you're off to a good start already. If not, start small by making simple meals and following easy recipes. You can gradually build up your kitchen skills as you get more comfortable, but trying too much all at once is a good way to fail and get discouraged. Look for books specifically aimed at beginners or search for easy recipes online. Instructions that provide step-by-step pictures are often the easiest to follow along.\n2. Take a class. Look for free and cheap cooking classes in your area. Focus on developing skills that you're specifically interested in developing, and skip any class that will teach you something you already know or will teach you something you have no desire to learn. Local craft stores often offer classes on baking and food decorating. Small markets may have classes on cooking essentials. Check out cooking schools in your area. Even if you don't want to spend time and money on a cooking program, some of these schools offer one-time cooking courses at a discounted price.\n3. Find your niche. Not every domestic goddess needs to love cooking, but learning to enjoy it can motivate you into improving your skills. Try to find something about cooking or baking that you can feel passionate\u2014or at least interested\u2014about. Build up your cooking skills in general, but involve your point of interest as much as possible while doing so. Your passion might be something simple, like baking cookies or mastering stovetop cooking. On the other hand, you might find your attention grabbed by something a little more unique, like gluten-free baking or canning.\n4. Make any necessary adjustments. You might have a full set of cooking and baking skills when all is said and done, but that doesn't mean you will be able to show them all off each and every day. Know when to make a simple meal and when to whip up something more impressive. Learning how to use your cooking to improve and please those you're cooking for is another skill you will need to master. For example, if you're cooking for picky kids, focus on choosing kid-friendly meals instead of trying to impress them with an elaborate meal they won't even eat. When you're cooking for guests, find out about any food allergies or special diets ahead of time and plan your menu accordingly.\n5. Experiment. Once you feel comfortable enough in the kitchen, start using the skills and knowledge you have gained to experiment with your own recipes and tasty creations. Some experiments might be a success while others will likely be a failure. The important thing is simply to keep working at it until your successes vastly outnumber your failures.\n\n\n## Part three: sew and other \"lost\" skills\n\n1. Master the basics of sewing. Sewing is the queen of lost skills, so if you don't know even the most basic stitches, you really aren't alone. At minimum, though, you should know how to sew hems, repair small rips and tears, and attach buttons. Learn a variety of basic stitches, including the straight stitch, the back stitch, the zigzag stitch, and the basting stitch. Invest in a sewing machine. As your sewing skills improve, consider buying a sewing machine of your own. You will probably be glad that you did. Fixing garments and creating projects from scratch will both be much easier if you learn to machine sew as well as hand sew.\n2. Get crafty. Sewing is not the only lost skill worth learning, of course. There is a wide range of other crafts and domestic abilities you can explore. You do not need to master all of them, but picking one or two you'd like to become great at can improve your standing as a domestic goddess. Potential areas of interest could include gardening, crocheting, or knitting. You could also check out community craft websites, like Pinterest, to get more ideas.\n3. Take classes. You can learn a lot by teaching yourself, but sometimes, the best way to learn a new skill or to advance an old one is to take an actual class on it. Look for cheap classes in your area or sign up for a class online.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally conscious individual who is passionate about sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint.

{"conversations": ["I've been writing C and C++ code for almost twenty years, but there's one aspect of these languages that I've never really understood. I've obviously used regular casts i.e.\n```MyClass *m = (MyClass *)ptr;\n```\nall over the place, but there seem to be two other types of casts, and I don't know the difference. What's the difference between the following lines of code?\n```MyClass *m = (MyClass *)ptr;\nMyClass *m = static_cast(ptr);\nMyClass *m = dynamic_cast(ptr);\n```", "## static_cast\n\n`static_cast` is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. `static_cast` performs no runtime checks. This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, and thus a check would be unnecessary. Here is an example:\n\n```\nvoid func(void *data) {\n  // Conversion from MyClass* -> void* is implicit\n  MyClass *c = static_cast<MyClass*>(data);\n  ...\n}\n\nint main() {\n  MyClass c;\n  start_thread(&func, &c)  // func(&c) will be called\n      .join();\n}\n```\nIn this example, you know that you passed a `MyClass` object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this.\n\n## dynamic_cast\n\n`dynamic_cast` is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a `bad_cast` exception is thrown in that case).\n\n```\nif (JumpStm *j = dynamic_cast<JumpStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n} else if (ExprStm *e = dynamic_cast<ExprStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n}\n```\nAn \"up-cast\" (cast to the base class) is always valid with both `static_cast` and `dynamic_cast`, and also without any cast, as an \"up-cast\" is an implicit conversion (assuming the base class is accessible, i.e. it's a `public` inheritance).\n\n## Regular Cast\n\nThese casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering `dynamic_cast`. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of `const_cast`, `static_cast` and `reinterpret_cast`, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use `dynamic_cast`.\n\nIn addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the \"equivalent\" `static_cast` sequence would give you a compile-time error for that.\n\nSome people prefer C-style casts because of their brevity.

A good family relationship can help children grow up to be well-adjusted adults and can help adults maintain a healthy lifestyle. One of the most important things to do to build a good family relationship is to spend time together. Whether it is eating dinner together as a family or going on vacation, time spent together builds memories and strengthens the bond between family members. Another important thing to do is to be honest with one another. This means both telling the truth and being honest about one's feelings. Keeping secrets or hiding emotions can be very damaging to a family relationship.\n\nIn addition to spending time together and being honest, it is important for family members to support one another. This can mean helping each other out when times are tough or celebrating together when good things happen. It is also important to respect each other. Family members should respect each other's differences and opinions. This means not criticizing or judging one another. Family members should also take care of one another. This can mean helping out with chores or watching the kids so parents can have a night out, or it can mean taking an elderly relative to the doctor.\n\nTaking time to build a good family relationship is important, as family members will be there for one another throughout life.

{"conversations": ["How to cut carbon arrows?", "Carbon arrows are a lightweight alternative to aluminum, but they may not always come in the correct length you need. While you can always take the arrows into a hunting store to have them cut by a professional, you can also cut arrows at home with a rotary cutter or an arrow saw. Before you cut the arrows, be sure to measure your draw length to know how long the shafts need to be. When you\u2019re finished, your arrows will be the perfect size!\n\n## Find the proper arrow length\n\n1. Hold a tape measure out to your side with your non-dominant hand. Grip the tape measure in your nondominant hand so the tape points toward your wrist. Fully extend your nondominant arm out to your side so it\u2019s parallel to the ground to simulate holding a bow. Make sure you can easily grab and pull the tape toward you, and reposition the tape measure in your hand if you can\u2019t. Avoid using a fabric tape measure since it may give you an inaccurate measurement.\n2. Pull the tape to the corner of your mouth with your dominant hand. Grab the end of the tape with your dominant hand and slowly pull it out. Keep pulling the tape until the end touches the corner of your mouth on the dominant side of your body. For example, pull it to the right corner of your mouth if you\u2019re right-handed. Once the tape measure is fully extended, look at the measurement. Pulling the tape measure to the corner of your mouth simulates drawing a bowstring so you can get an accurate measurement for your draw length.Tip: Put your nondominant thumb on the tape measure before checking the measurement so it doesn\u2019t retract. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to measure again.\n3. Add 2 in (5.1 cm) to your measurement to find the arrow length. If your arrow is too short, it could jam your bow or cause the arrow to shoot improperly. Take the draw length measurement you just found and include an extra 2 inches (5.1 cm) to ensure that the arrows are long enough for your bow. For example, if your draw length measurement was 29 inches (74 cm), then the length of your arrow should be 31 inches (79 cm).\n4. Transfer your measurement onto the arrow shaft. Start your measuring tape at the back of the arrow shaft and extend the tape toward the front. When you reach the measurement you found, use a marker to draw a line or dot on the arrow shaft so you know where to cut. Rotate the arrow 180 degrees and make another mark in the same place to use as reference. Don\u2019t include the arrow\u2019s nock in the measurement since nock sizes vary between arrows. Start at the base of the arrow shaft instead.\n\n\n## Use a rotary cutter\n\n1. Clamp a rotary cutter horizontally over the edge of the table. A rotary cutter is a handheld multitool that spins quickly to cut through materials. Use a rotary cutter with a circular carbide blade so it can easily cut through the carbon arrows without deforming them. Lay the rotary cutter horizontally so the blade is vertical and hangs over the edge of your work surface. Use a C-clamp to secure the tool to your work surface so it doesn\u2019t shift around while you\u2019re using it. You can buy a rotary cutter from your local hardware store.Tip: Make sure you can easily access the power switch on the tool so you can turn it on and off when you need it.\n2. Position the hose of a shop vacuum behind the rotary blade. Cutting carbon arrows creates dust that can cause irritation if you breathe it in, so it\u2019s easiest to vacuum it immediately to prevent it from spreading. Set the end of the hose on your work surface so it\u2019s directly behind the rotary cutter\u2019s blade. Connect the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum. You can also use your regular vacuum if you don\u2019t have a shop vacuum available.\n3. Put on safety glasses and a face mask before turning the machines on. Carbon dust can cause irritation if it gets in your eyes or lungs, so it\u2019s important to stay protected while you work. Put on safety glasses that cover your eyes completely, and a face mask that guards your nose and mouth. Once you put on your safety equipment, you can start the rotary tool and the vacuum. Even though you have a vacuum capturing most of the dust, there still may be particles floating around.\n4. Cut the arrow along the mark you made. Once your rotary tool is spinning at full speed, carefully guide the arrow so the blade lines up with the marks you made earlier. Push the shaft gently against the blade so it cuts into the carbon. Continue pushing the arrow into the blade until it cuts completely through the other side. If the blade has difficulty cutting the arrow straight through, try rotating the arrow while you hold it against the blade to make it easier.\n\n\n## Cut shaft with an arrow saw\n\n1. Attach a shop vacuum hose to the port on the back of an arrow saw. Many arrow saws have a port on the back where you can attach a vacuum hose to collect dust. Push the end of a shop vacuum hose into the dust collection port on the arrow saw until it\u2019s secured in place. Attach the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum. You can buy arrow saws from hunting supply stores or you can order them online. Arrow saws usually cost around $130 USD. You can use your regular vacuum if you don\u2019t have access to a shop vacuum.Tip: If your arrow saw doesn\u2019t have a port for a vacuum hose, then set the hose as close to the blade as you can.\n2. Wear safety glasses and a face mask while you\u2019re cutting arrows. Carbon arrows create carbon fiber dust when you cut them, which can be irritating if you inhale it or if it gets in your eyes. Wear safety glasses that cover your eyes completely and put on a face mask to protect your mouth and nose. Once you have the face mask and safety glasses on, you can turn on your machines.\n3. Position the arrow on the saw so the back sits inside of the notch on the support. Your arrow saw will have a support with a notch on it so your arrow doesn\u2019t roll around while you\u2019re cutting it. Set the back of the arrow in the notch and line up the front of the arrow so the mark you made on the shaft lines up with the saw blade. Your arrow saw may have multiple supports on it. If so, make sure the arrow sits in all of the notches to ensure you make a straight cut.\n4. Rotate the arrow while it\u2019s against the saw blade to cut completely through it. Once your arrow saw is running at full speed, slowly push the arrow shaft into the blade. Once it starts cutting into the arrow, spin the arrow so the blade cuts around the circumference of the shaft. As soon as you around the circumference of the arrow, the end will fall off and you can turn off your saw. Your arrow saw may be powerful enough to cut through the shaft without rotating it.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an archer or bowhunter with a keen interest in sustainable practices.

{"conversations": ["How to reduce smog?", "Smog is a form of air pollution that is produced in the atmosphere when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC). When this reaction occurs, particles are released into the atmosphere, and oxygen at the ground level absorbs harmful compounds (ozone). All of this creates what we consider smog. Recent years have seen an increase in campaigns for the reduction of smog due to its harmful effects towards both humans and the environment.\n\n## Change your car habit\n\n1. Drive less. Vehicles that run only on gasoline produce nitrogen dioxide as a byproduct of driving and idling, so one easy way to cut back on emissions is to drive less. Try walking, biking, or taking public transit instead. If your location is close enough, try walking or biking, especially if the destination has showers for clean up (workplace, gym, etc.). Many large cities offer public transportation such as buses, subways, trains and \"park and ride\" which allows you to park your vehicle and take public transit to your destination. Don't drive during certain times. For example, drive less during peak traffic periods, when it is extremely hot, or when there are ozone warnings in effect. This is because gas fumes turn into harmful ground level ozone when they heat up. If driving is a necessity, try setting up a carpool so there are fewer cars on the road and fewer trips being made.\n2. Maintain your car. Keeping your car \"healthy\" will not only improve mileage and save money, it can also reduce emissions. Get regular tune-ups and oil changes and make sure your tires are properly inflated to ensure your car is functioning at its best. Many states require smog and emission tests to make sure your car isn't emitting too much pollution. These are usually required annually or bi-annually. Inflating your tires to the correct pressure allows the engine to function better by maintaining a steady load. Consult your mechanic or your owner's manual for specific information regarding maintenance for your vehicle.\n3. Fuel up in cooler temperatures. Pump gas early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures drop. This prevents the fumes from gasoline from heating up and creating harmful toxins at ground level (ozone). There are alternative fuel sources that are in the works such as ethanol, natural gas, and hydrogen, but not all engines can function off of these fuel sources.\n4. Purchase a hybrid or electric vehicle. These vehicles have been known to dramatically reduce emissions for many reasons (depending on the type of model). Some decrease the consumption of fuel while others do away with fuel altogether. The result is a reduction in tailpipe emissions and therefore a reduction in smog. Hybrid vehicles are fueled by gasoline alone but have the ability to recapture energy and use it to power the car, resulting in less fuel consumption. Electric vehicles are powered by electricity alone and must be plugged in and charged in order to drive. Plug-in hybrids are the best of both worlds, running off of either electricity or gasoline.\n\n\n## Change your consumption habit\n\n1. Avoid high VOC products. VOCs are chemicals that easily escape into the atmosphere through common use around the house. Check the front label of household products to determine if they contain VOCs. Examples of common products include nail care products (acetone, ethyl alcohol), paint strippers or adhesive removers (methylene chloride), and aerosol spray products (butane). Check the National Institute of Health's Household Products Database for more information about specific products and their ingredients. Shop for \"green\" products that don't contain VOCs. If you must use VOC products, buy in small quantities that can be used quickly instead of stored. If you must store the product, do so in a tightly sealed, original container, in a well-ventilated area.\n2. Avoid gas-powered yard equipment. Gasoline emissions are one of the major causes of smog--whether from vehicles or lawn equipment. Try eco-friendly lawn mowers, hedgers, trimmers, or any other lawn equipment that can be powered electrically. You can also avoid mowing altogether by changing the material in your yard. Opt for artificial grass, succulents, hard landscapes, or rock gardens to do away with mowing forever. This will also save you time and money spent on maintenance and watering. There are also \"real grass alternatives\" that look and act like traditional grass turf, but require less maintenance.\n3. Buy local. When you buy products that are made locally, it cuts down on the cost of transport which reduces emissions. Local farmers' markets and grocery stores can help you determine where items were produced. There are many sites online that link local buyers and sellers such as Direct Local Food, GrowBuyEat, and AgLocal. Besides farmers' markets, try local farmers' stands, farms, and wineries. There are even many restaurants that are joining the movement towards supporting locally grown items. Make a community garden. Grow vegetables and fruit for your community and local distribution.\n4. Be energy efficient in your home. The less energy you consume at home, the less pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. There are many ways to decrease energy consumption including through lighting, heating and cooling, and appliance use. Replace your old incandescent light bulbs with energy saving halogen incandescents, CFLs, and LEDs which can be found at your local hardware store. For heating and cooling try energy-saving thermostats that automatically reset temperatures while you're away from home. Shop for energy-efficient appliances that use less energy such as washers, dryers, refrigerators, and dishwashers.\n\n\n## Take a stand\n\n1. Don't support organizations that have poor environmental practices. By not supporting commerce from these companies, you raise awareness of the problem. For example, companies like Nestle, Pfizer, and Walmart have been known to not only add pollution to the air but to also violate pollution regulations. An app such as Buycott can help you identify products and companies with poor environmental track records, simply by scanning a product's barcode.\n2. Promote your stance. Don't be afraid to tell people your opinion on the issue, and what you are doing to help solve it. You can do this by speaking to those closest to you (family, friends, co-workers) or reach more people through social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube). Start a community project such as an initiative to replace light bulbs or a carpool to a farmer's market once a month. Start a carpool with your co-workers. Not only will it cut down on emissions but it will demonstrate your passion for the cause.\n3. Contact local politicians and business leaders. Ask them for information about what they are doing to reduce smog levels in your community. If they do not reply or reply with inadequate measures, consider lobbying for change. Sign a petition. There are many petitions online that are lobbying for better air quality control by our government. Find one that peaks your interest, or start your own. Try sites like change.org or petitions.whitehouse.gov to look for petitions or start one on a smaller, local level.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental activist, marine biologist, or a concerned citizen with a strong interest in sustainability and ocean conservation.

{"conversations": ["How to survive an earthquake?", "## Take cover indoors\n\n1. Get away from glass, large furniture, and other hazards, if possible. In the first few seconds after the shaking starts, try to quickly move away from anything that could fall and injure you. Get low and walk or crawl away from hazards such as windows, cabinets, televisions, and bookcases. If you're in a crowded public place, such as a store, do not rush toward the exits, even if you see lots of people doing so. Get away from display racks, glass, and exterior walls, and find a covered spot to take shelter. Remember the phrase \u201cDrop, Cover, Hold on,\u201d which is the course of action recommended by U.S. and international emergency management organizations.\n2. Drop to your hands and knees under a sturdy table or desk. Look for a sturdy piece of furniture, such as a solid table, that can offer cover from falling objects. Get down on your hands and knees, and crouch under the desk or table until the shaking stops. If you're in bed during an earthquake, stay there. Brace yourself, and protect your head and neck with a pillow. If you can't get under a sturdy table or desk, take cover in an interior corner of the building. Don't stand in a doorway. This is was recommended in the past, but you're safer under a sturdy table or crouched in a corner. A doorway doesn't offer much protection from falling or flying objects, which cause the most earthquake-related injuries and deaths.\n3. Protect your head and neck from falling debris. If possible, grab a pillow, sofa cushion, or another object to shield your face and head. If there's nothing nearby to use as a shield, cover your face, head, and neck with your hands and arms. A strong earthquake can kick up clouds of dangerous dust. If this is the case, you should also cover your nose and mouth with a handkerchief or an article of clothing.\n4. Remain in your safe spot until the shaking stops. Stay put until the shaking has stopped for 1 or 2 minutes. Remain on guard when you get up, as aftershocks can occur at any time after an earthquake. In the event of an earthquake, you and your family (or coworkers, if you're at work) should meet in a designated safe location. Create an action plan in advance, and head to the designated meeting place once the shaking has stopped. If an aftershock occurs, drop, cover, and hold on until it stops.\n5. Use caution around debris after leaving your shelter. Watch out for broken glass and rubble. If you're not wearing shoes, tread lightly, and be extremely careful not to injure yourself. Grab a pair of heavy-soled shoes and, if you're wearing light clothing, put on a pair of pants and a long-sleeved shirt. In a strong earthquake, remember to cover your mouth to avoid inhaling dust, especially if you have a history of any respiratory diseases. If you're trapped, don't shout, as you'd risk inhaling dust. Instead, send a text or call emergency services, tap on a hard surface, or, if you have one, blow a whistle to alert first responders of your location.\n6. Check for injuries and render aid, if needed. Call emergency services if you or someone nearby are injured and need medical attention. If you know first aid or CPR, administer emergency care as needed. To perform CPR, place one hand over the center of the person's chest, and hold your other hand over the first. Keep your arms straight as you press directly into their chest at a rate of about 100 beats per minute. Stop bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound. Pack the wound with sterile gauze or a clean cloth and apply firm pressure. If firm pressure doesn't stop the bleeding, use a belt, article of clothing, or bandages to fashion a tourniquet. Wrap the tourniquet 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) above the wound toward the torso. For a wound on the thigh, wrap the tourniquet above the wound near the groin to limit the amount of blood flowing from the heart. If someone is seriously injured or unconscious, don't move them unless the building is structurally unsound or they're otherwise in immediate danger.\n7. Inspect the building for structural damage and hazards. Check for cracks in the building's structure, fires, the smell of gas, and damaged wires or electrical appliances. If you believe the building is unsound, evacuate immediately. If possible, and if there's no immediate threat that the building will collapse, respond to any utility hazards. If you smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the main valve outside and call the gas company. Note that a professional will be needed to restore service. Look for signs of electrical damage, including sparks, broken or frayed wires, and burning smells. If possible, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you'd have to step in water to access the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician instead of approaching it yourself. Put out any small fires with a fire extinguisher. If there's a larger fire, call emergency services. Evacuate immediately if there's a fire and you smell gas. Don't drink water from the sink, bathe, or use the toilet until your local authorities have advised that it's safe to do so. Plug the drains in sinks and bathtubs to prevent sewage backflow.\n\n\n## Rid it out in a vehicle\n\n1. Stop in a clear area away from trees, buildings, and other structures. Find an open area and stop your vehicle on the shoulder or side of the road. Get as far away as you can from utility poles, large structures, bridges, and any other potential hazards. Pay attention to surrounding traffic, and stop only when it's safe to do so. Don't stop abruptly, or vehicles to the rear might collide with you.\n2. Set your parking brake and wait until the shaking stops. The car may jiggle violently during an earthquake, but stay put and try to remain calm. You're safer in a car than outside, since vehicles offer protection from debris and falling objects. Turn on your radio, as channels should be broadcasting emergency broadcast information.\n3. Beware of damaged roads, debris, and other hazards when you continue driving. Listen for reports of road closures or hazards on the emergency broadcast. When the shaking stops, resume driving and keep your eye out for damaged roadways, sinkholes, unsound bridges, and any other potential hazards. If a power line has fallen on your vehicle or you're otherwise unable to travel, stay put. Call emergency services, and wait for first responders.\n\n\n## Stay safe outdoors\n\n1. Move away from buildings, street lights, power lines, and bridges. The most dangerous locations during an earthquake are areas immediately around buildings. As soon as the ground begins shaking, try to get as far away as possible from any nearby structures. Stay low to the ground to keep your balance as you get to a safe spot, and keep your eye out for falling debris. Do not seek shelter under a bridge or overpass. Additionally, look out for sinkholes, open faults, or large holes in the ground.\n2. Crouch down low in a wide open area until the shaking stops. Once you've made your way away from nearby structures, get on your hands and knees and cover your head. See if there are any objects nearby to use as a shield, such as a trash can lid. If none are available, cover your head and neck with your hands and arms. Remain crouched low to the ground in a covered position until the shaking stops.\n3. Watch out for hazards as you assess your surroundings. As you venture out after the earthquake, beware of broken glass, rubble, downed power lines, fallen trees, and any other potential hazards. Check yourself and anyone nearby for injuries. If necessary, administer first aid and call emergency services. Stay away from damaged structures and areas immediately around buildings. Remember that aftershocks may occur. If there's an aftershock, weakened buildings, windows, and architectural details can fall to the ground.\n4. Get to higher ground if you're on the shore or near a dam. If a shaking lasts more than 20 seconds, don't wait for an alarm or warning to flee. Get to ground that's at least 100 ft (30 m) above sea level or 2 mi (3.2 km) from the shore. Earthquakes can cause tsunamis, so put distance between yourself and the coast. While a catastrophic failure is unlikely, earthquake damage can cause flooding downstream from a dam. If you live in a flood zone, proceed to higher ground. Check evacuation plans in advance if you live near a dam in an earthquake-prone area.\n\n\n## Prepare for an earthquake\n\n1. Make an emergency supply kit. Keep your supplies in an easily accessible spot, such as a hall closet or garage. Make sure every member of your family knows where your emergency supplies are located. Keep the following items on hand:\n\t* Enough bottled water and non-perishable food to last 3 days. A first aid kit, including gauze, alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, tweezers, ibuprofen or another pain reliever, cotton swabs, anti-diarrhea medication, sanitary napkins, and eyewash. Medications that any members of your family take regularly. A flashlight and extra batteries. Tools, including a screwdriver and adjustable wrench. A whistle, to alert first responders in the event you become trapped. Clothes and blankets. Your pet's food and medication, if you have one.\n2. Create a family survival plan for your home. You and anyone you live with should have a plan to quickly get to safety in the event of an emergency. Instruct every member of your household to drop, cover, and hold on, then to head to a designated meeting location when the shaking stops. Designated spots might be a clearing near your home, a school, community center, or a shelter. Make a plan to reunite ahead of time, as phone service may be limited and should be used only for emergencies. Conduct practice drills every 6 months to ensure you and your loved ones know exactly what to do in the event of an earthquake.\n3. Identify safe spots and hazards in each room of your home. Look for tall cabinets, televisions, dressers, bookcases, hanging plants, and other objects that could fall and cause injury. Go room by room with your family members, and note spots that offer protection and those that are potentially dangerous. For example, if there's a heavy desk in your child's bedroom, tell them to take cover under it. Advise them to stay away from their windows and dresser.\n4. Store dangerous objects in a secure cabinet or on lower shelves. Avoid storing heavy objects high up, and install brackets to secure tall furniture to walls. Keep any dangerous items, such as sharp objects, glass, and flammable or toxic substances in locked or low cabinets. Objects such as knives or corrosive liquids can cause serious injury, especially if they fall from a high storage spot during an earthquake.\n5. Take first-aid and CPR classes to become certified. If someone nearby is hurt in an earthquake, basic knowledge of first aid can be a lifesaver. A CPR certification will prepare you to respond if the worst happens. Look online for nearby classes, or check with a local clinic or Red Cross chapter.\n6. Learn how to shut off the water, the electricity, and the gas. Earthquakes can damage utilities and cause flooding, fires, or explosions. If you're not sure how to shut off your utilities, call your service providers for specific instructions. To shut off electricity, turn off individual circuits or fuses at the main box, then turn off the main circuit or fuse. Your gas main should be near your gas meter, but locations vary. Use an adjustable wrench to turn the valve 1/4 turn clockwise. Your water main should be at your water meter by the street or sidewalk, but it may be inside your home. Turn the valve 1/4 turn clockwise to shut off your water.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual who lives in an earthquake-prone region, seeking practical advice on emergency preparedness and survival techniques during an earthquake.

{"conversations": ["In Dupire's local volatility model, the volatility is is a deterministic function of the underlying price and time, chosen to match observed European option prices.\nTo be more specific, given a smooth surface $(K,T)\\mapsto C(K,T)$ where K is the strike and T is time to maturity. Dupire equation implies that there exits an unique continuous function $\\sigma_{loc}$ defined by\n$$\\sigma_{loc}^{2}(K,T)=\\frac{\\partial_{T}C(K,T)+rK\\partial_{K}C(K,T)}{\\frac{1}{2}K^{2}\\partial_{KK}C(K,T)}$$ for all $(K,T)\\in(0,\\infty)\\times(0,\\infty)$ such that the solution to the stochastic differential equation $dS_{t}/S_{t}=rdt+\\sigma(t,S_{t})dW_{t}$ exactly generates the European call option prices.\nWhat do the dynamics of the local volatility mean? Are dynamics equivalent to the volatility surface? Why the dynamics of local volatility model is highly unrealistic?", "A general model (with continuous paths) can be written\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r_t dt + \\sigma_t dW_t^S\n$$\nwhere the short rate $r_t$ and spot volatility $\\sigma_t$ are stochastic processes. \nIn the Black-Scholes model both $r$ and $\\sigma$ are deterministic functions of time (even constant in the original model). This produces a flat smile for any expiry $T$. And we have the closed form formula for option prices\n$$\n  C(t,S;T,K) = BS(S,T-t,K;\\Sigma(T,K))\n$$\nwhere $BS$ is the BS formula and $\\Sigma(T,K) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T-t}\\int_t^T \\sigma(s)^2 ds}$. This is not consistent with the smile observed on the market. In order to match market prices, one needs to use a different volatility for each expiry and strike. This is the implied volatility surface $(T,K) \\mapsto \\Sigma(T,K)$. \nIn the local volatility model, rates are deterministic, instant volatility is stochastic but there is only one source of randomness\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r(t) dt + \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) dW_t^S\n$$\nthis is a special case of the general model with\n$$\n  d\\sigma_t = (\\partial_t \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + r(t)S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + \\frac{1}{2}S_t^2\\partial_S^2\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)) dt + \\frac{1}{2}S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)^2 dW_t^S\n$$\nWhat is appealing with this model is that the function $\\sigma_{Dup}$ can be perfectly calibrated to match all market vanilla prices (and quite easily too). \nThe problem is that while correlated to the spot, statistical study show that the volatility also has its own source of randomness independent of that of the spot. Mathematically, this means the instant correlation between the spot and vol is not 1 contrary to what happens in the local volatility model. \nThis can be seen in several ways:\n\n1. The forward smile. Forward implied volatility is implied from prices of forward start options: ignoring interest rates,\n$$\n  C(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K) := E^Q[(\\frac{S_{T+\\theta}}{S_{T}}-K)_+] =: C_{BS}(S=1,\\theta,K;\\Sigma(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K))\n$$\nAlternatively, it is sometimes defined as the expectation of implied volatility at a forward date. In a LV model, as the maturity $T$ increases but $\\theta$ is kept constant, the forward smile gets flatter and higher. This is not what we observe in the markets where the forward smile tends to be similar to the current smile.\n\nThis is because the initial smile you calibrate the model too has decreasing skew:\n$$\n\\partial_K \\Sigma(0,S;T,K) \\xrightarrow[T\\to +\\infty]{} 0\n$$ \n\n2. Smile rolling. In a LV model, smile tends to move in the opposite direction of the spot and get higher independently of the direction of the spot.\nThis is not consistent with what is observed on markets. See Hagan and al. Managing Smile Risk for the derivation. This means that\n$\\partial_S \\Sigma_{LV}(t,S;T,K)$ often has the wrong sign so your Delta will be wrong which can lead to a higher hedging error than using BS. \n3. Barrier options. In FX markets, barrier options like Double No Touch are liquid but a LV model calibrated to vanilla prices does not reproduce these prices. This is a consequence of the previous point.   \n\nThe LV model is a static model. Its whole dynamic comes from the volatility surface at time 0. But the vol surface has a dynamic that is richer than that.\nThere are alternatives using multiple factors like SV models, LSV models (parametric local vol like SABR or fully non parametric local vol), models of the joint dynamic of the spot and vol surface etc... but the LV model remains the default model in many cases due to its simplicity, its ability to calibrate the initial smile perfectly and its numerical efficiency.

Servicing a telescope in orbit makes that look like small change.  (Cost comparable to the cost of building a new giant scope on Earth.) And in-orbit servicing can't even be done with current technology except in low earth orbit.\n(4) While high resolution is one frontier in astronomy, going deep is another, and going deep requires big mirrors.  A 30 meter mirror on Earth gathers much more light than a 5 meter mirror in space.  The giant terrestrial telescopes simply do a better job of being light buckets for spectroscopy than anything we can yet put into space.\n\nThe bottom line is that with the development of adaptive optics, space-based telescopes of currently buildable and launchable size lost their main advantage over ground-based telescopes.  And since they're 10x to 100x the cost, they are simply not worth building for many purposes.\n\nSpace based telescopes still hold a significant edge in parts of the spectrum blocked by the atmosphere such as UV and IR (Webb), and for certain tasks involving long-term high accuracy photometry (Kepler) and astrometry (Gaia).  But for general purpose use, the balance seems firmly on the ground's side for large telescopes.\n\nThis will change if space flight becomes cheaper -- the SpaceX BFR, for example, with its 9 meter fairing and dramatically lower launch costs, offers great hope for space telescopes."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "an astrophysicist, astronomer, or space researcher with a focus on observational astronomy.

{"conversations": ["How much does it cost to make a MOOC universally accessible, as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990?", "The cost of making a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) universally accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of content the MOOC contains ( video / text / etc.). Meeting the Section 508* requirements for Web pages used in such a course is effectively without cost if one starts out to make such pages accessible. Retrofitting might cost as much as the original project, but the cost should be near zero for modern MOOCs.\n\n* Captioning and Transcripts: Closed (or open) captions are very expensive. Unless done at a foreign sweatshop, cost is $5.00 to $15.00 per minute, so something like $12,000 as a minimum, up over $35,000, for a one-semester course. In other words, the captioning can cost more than the professor. That's at least part of why some institutions employ ASL interpreters for class sections with deaf students. The $5-15 number given above could be reduced by using student labor, especially if the students are majors in the material being subtitled. In addition, captioning through voice recognition is getting much better, but still requires certain amount of manual editing. \n\n* Audio Descriptions: Making course materials available to the blind means being sure that everything that is shown is also described, either by the speaker who is presenting or in a manner that can be rendered through text-to-speech. The latter means being sure that there are good \"alt\" descriptions of images and that appropriate markup, e.g. MathML, is used for things like equations. In disciplines like computing, that isn't onerous, and the costs may disappear in the weeds of getting the course done. Things might be very different in a discipline like the visual arts.\n\n* Screen Reader Compatibility: Ensuring that the MOOC is compatible with screen readers and assistive technologies can involve additional development and testing efforts. This cost may vary depending on the complexity of the course platform and its current level of accessibility.\n\nIt is recommended to consult with accessibility experts, organizations specializing in accessible design, or accessibility consultants who can provide more accurate estimates based on the specific requirements of your MOOC. They can conduct a comprehensive evaluation and provide cost estimates tailored to your project's needs.", "If captioning costs $5-$15 per minute, how does it become effectively free if you start out with it in mind?", "Sorry for causing any confusions.

{"conversations": ["How to go to amarnath temple?", "## Plan and prepare for the trip\n\n1. Plan to visit between June and August. Since snow and ice usually cover the cave temple, you won\u2019t be able to access it during the cold winter and spring months. Wait until mid-June or July to plan your trip to the Amarnath Temple. Usually, the cave stays open through the first 1\u20132 weeks of August before it closes due to the terrain getting too difficult for travel. The actual dates when you can travel to the temple are chosen by the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) and it varies depending on the weather and how clear the trails are. You will not be able to reach the Amarnath Temple at any other time of the year.\n2. Get a Compulsory Health Certificate by a doctor approved by the SASB. Look at the list of approved doctors on the SASB website and schedule an appointment to see one. Bring the Compulsory Health Certificate from the site with you and fill out the self-assessment on top. Allow your doctor to run any tests to check if you\u2019re fit for traveling to the Amarnath Temple. If they approve you for traveling, then you\u2019ll be able to make the journey.You can find the Compulsory Health Certificate for 2020 here: http://www.shriamarnathjishrine.com/Yatra2019/CHC%20form%20for%20Yatra%20-%202020.pdf. The certificate you need changes each year, so make sure you\u2019re using the proper one. Since the Amarnath Temple is 4,000 metres (2.5 mi) above sea level, it\u2019s possible to get altitude sickness if you aren\u2019t fit enough for the trip.Warning: You will not be allowed to go to Amarnath Temple if you are under 13, over 75, or more than 6 weeks pregnant.\n3. Submit a registration form online to the SASB. Select the date you want to travel to the temple on the calendar at the top of the page. Fill out the personal details on the registration form completely, including your name, birthday, phone number, and address. Then, list the clinic and doctor that completed your Compulsory Health Certificate. Upload a photograph of yourself and a scanned copy of the certificate before submitting the registration form.You can find the online registration form here: http://jksasb.nic.in/register.aspx. If you are accepted to travel to the temple, you will receive a text or email message about how to pay the 50 INR ($0.70 USD) fee. When you receive a permit, you must keep a copy on you at all times during your trip.\n4. Start taking 4\u20135 km (2.5\u20133.1 mi) walks 1 month prior to your trip. Start building up your endurance at least 1\u20132 months before your scheduled date of departure. Try to take the walks in the early morning or evening so you can get used to breathing in cool air. Continue taking walks each day up until you leave so you don\u2019t get exhausted while you hike to the temple.You can also practice deep breathing exercises and yoga so you\u2019re able to improve your oxygen efficiency. This will help you breathe easier when you\u2019re at a higher altitude since there isn\u2019t as much oxygen in the air.\n5. Pack warm clothes, waterproof shoes, a water bottle, and a walking stick. Only bring a lightweight, waterproof bag so you don\u2019t get exhausted while you\u2019re trekking to the temple. Opt for wool clothes that are waterproof so you stay warm. Make sure you use waterproof trekking shoes and a walking stick so you\u2019re easily able to traverse more difficult terrain. Since you'll be active, opt for a reusable water bottle as well.Other things you may need for your trip include an umbrella, flashlight, hat, gloves, and a raincoat. The weather can be unpredictable and temperatures may dip below 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F) during the night. You don\u2019t have to bring tents or sleeping bags since there will be sites where you can spend the night.\n\n\n## Get to the temple\n\n1. Choose the Pahalgam route for an easier trek that lasts 3\u20135 days total. Select Pahalgam as your starting point if you want to follow the traditional pilgrimage route to the temple. While the trip does take longer to complete, it doesn\u2019t have any steep slopes that are difficult to climb, and you can ride or use ponies during most of the ascent. You will hike about 48 kilometres (30 mi) if you go from Pahalgam to the Amarnath Temple. You don\u2019t have to pay any additional fees to take the Pahalgam route.\n2. Pick the Baltal route for a steep climb that only takes 1\u20132 days round trip. If you\u2019re an experienced climber or you feel like making the trip within a shorter amount of time, opt to start in Baltal, which is just north of the temple. Though the route from Baltal is much steeper than the path from Pahalgam, you can make the round-trip journey within a day.Plan to hike about 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) using the Baltal route. If you\u2019re too tired to descend back to Baltal, you can opt to stay at a camp at the top overnight before leaving the next day. There are no other fees to take the Baltal route.Warning: Ponies are not allowed on the Baltal route since it\u2019s too steep, so you will have to walk the entire way.\n3. Fly into Srinagar to get the closest to either base camp. Look for flights that come into the Srinagar International Airport, since it\u2019s only 2\u20133 hours from both Pahalgam and Baltalhead. Try to schedule your flight into the airport 1\u20132 days before the date you\u2019re scheduled to go to Amarnath Temple so you have time to travel.You can also fly or take a train to Jammu, but you\u2019ll need to drive or take a bus further to to the base camps.\n4. Take a bus or taxi to the base camp you selected. Look for a bus or taxi service that runs from Srinagar to either Pahalgam or Baltal, depending on which route you plan on traveling. Typically, your ride will only last around 2\u20133 hours, but it may take longer depending on the road conditions.If you have a vehicle, you can also drive yourself to the base camps. Usually, there is some on-site parking, but it may be busy due to the number of travelers for the pilgrimage.\n5. Hire a helicopter tour if you don\u2019t want to hike all the way to the temple. Helicopters fly out from both Pahalgam and Baltal, so you can reserve them for either base camp. Choose the date that you want to travel to the temple and reserve your spot. Arrive at the helicopter port on your scheduled day and take it up toward the temple. The helicopter will be able to take you as close as 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) away, but you will need to hike the rest of the way.Typically, a helicopter tour will cost around 3,600 INR ($50 USD) for a round trip.\n\n\n## Trek to the cave\n\n1. Carry your belongings in a waterproof bag. Store your clothes and everything you\u2019ve brought with you in a waterproof bag or backpack so they don\u2019t get wet. Use a bag that fits tightly on your shoulders and back so it doesn\u2019t cause any strain while you climb up to the temple. Make sure you zip the bag at all times so water doesn\u2019t leak inside or get your things wet. Weather can be unpredictable during your ascent, so it may snow or rain while you\u2019re climbing to the temple.\n2. Stop at tea stalls or small restaurant huts for meals and drinks. Look for small huts or stands along the route to the temple to see what kind of food and drinks they offer. Pay for the rations and enjoy them at one of the camps along the route. Otherwise, save non-perishable food in your bag so you can have it later during your trek.Some stalls may charge for food while others volunteer and provide meals for free.Tip: Always carry some back-up snacks, such as dried fruits or nuts, with you so you can eat as you get hungry.\n3. Protect your skin with sunscreen or petroleum jelly. Keep a bottle of sunscreen or petroleum jelly in your bag so you have access to it whenever you need it. Apply it to your exposed skin and rub it in until it\u2019s clear so it can absorb fully. After 2 hours, put on another layer so you stay protected from the sun.Petroleum jelly can also help keep your skin from drying out due to the cold, dry air.\n4. Rest at the camps set up along the route. Look for tents and huts along the route where you\u2019re able to rest for the night during your trip. Pay for tent rental and take time to relax so you don\u2019t feel too exhausted when you reach the shrine. Make sure your clothes aren\u2019t wet before you fall asleep so you don\u2019t get cold at night.If you\u2019re shivering, slurring speech, experiencing blurry vision, or feeling nauseous, you may be experiencing altitude sickness. Rest as soon as possible and avoid climbing any higher.\n5. Pray to Shiva at the ice lingam when you reach the holy shrine. When you reach the Amarnath Temple, take off your shoes and enter the cave to see the ice lingam, which is a tall column of ice that\u2019s considered holy. Say a prayer to Shiva while you\u2019re next to the lingam before exiting the shrine.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A traveler or tourist planning a trip to India, specifically interested in visiting the Taj Mahal.

{"conversations": ["How to make rose centerpieces?", "Roses are a great addition to any table for any occasion. Instead of placing them into a vase, however, why not get more creative? Rose centerpieces are easy to make, and you can use silk roses or real ones. Topiaries are the most popular, but you can also create a simpler one by placing a rose into a tall vase and filling it to the top with water.\n\n## Make a silk rise topiary\n\n1. Hot glue a Styrofoam ball to the top of a glass or crystal candlestick. Cover the top of the candlestick with hot glue, then quickly press the Styrofoam ball into the glue. You can use any size Styrofoam ball you want, but something around 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) would be ideal. Keep the ball proportionate to the candle stick. The smaller the ball, the shorter the candle stick should be.\n2. Get a bouquet of mini silk roses and snip the flowers off. Leave a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) long stem on each rose. If possible, use a pair of wire cutters to do this. Many silk flowers have wire inside the stem, which can ruin a good pair of scissors. If you cannot find wire cutters, use a pair of sturdy scissors you don't mind possibly ruining.\n3. Poke a rose into the top of a Styrofoam ball. If the rose is very loose, pull it out, add a drop of glue into the hole, then push the rose back in. You want the base of the rose touching the Styrofoam ball. You can use tacky glue or hot glue.\n4. Add more roses in a ring around the first one. Make sure that all of the roses are touching one another, including the one in the center. Once again, if any of the roses feel loose, secure them with a drop of hot glue.\n5. Continue adding roses in rings until you reach the bottom of the Styrofoam ball. When you are done, the entire ball should be covered in roses. Make sure that there are no gaps or bits of Styrofoam showing.\n6. Wrap a ribbon around the middle of the candlestick. Tie the ends of the ribbon into a large bow. For that final touch, snip the ends of the ribbon at an angle. A satin ribbon would work the best, but you can also use a sheer ribbon as well. It can match the color of your rose ball, or it can be an accent color instead, such as silver or gold.\n\n\n## Make a real rise topiary\n\n1. Soak a block of green floral foam in water overnight. This will help keep the roses stay fresher longer when you stick them into the foam. There are several different types of floral foam. Make sure that you get the kind meant for fresh flowers. You can find it in the floral section of an arts and crafts shop. Do not use regular white Styrofoam for this. You need the foam to be able to soak up water so that the roses stay fresh. Be careful when handling this type of foam. It is very soft when dry and easily dented.\n2. Put the foam block into a vessel. You can use a fancy bowl, planter, vase, or even a pedestal meant for pillar candles. It should sit below the rim of your bowl, planter, or vase. If the foam is too big, cut it down to the right size and shape. If you are setting the foam down onto a pedestal, cut it down to a rough dome or orb shape.\n3. Get an assortment of roses and put them into a bucket of water. You can use roses in all one color, or you can experiment using different colors. You can also get different shades of the same color for an ombre effect. Plan on using about 48 roses. If you plan on using multiple shades or colors, put them into separate buckets. This will make sorting through them easier. Consider using fragrant roses. This is a small detail that often gets overlooked but will add a nice touch.\n4. Cut about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) off of each stem. Use a clean pair of garden shears and cut the stems at an angle. It would be a good idea to cut off the leaves and thorns as well. If your foam block is very small, you may want to cut the stems down to about 3 inches (7.63 centimeters).\n5. Poke the roses into the foam. Insert them close enough so that the blooms touch. Keep adding roses until the foam is no longer visible. You don't have to poke the roses all the way down into the foam. If you are sticking the roses into a bowl, planter, or vase, consider sticking them in as different depths to create a dome-like effect. If you are going for an ombre effect, start with your lightest color, then move on to the darkest. You can arrange it in stripes or rings.\n6. Add some finishing touches. At this point, your centerpiece is done. You can move it to the table, and leave it as is, or you can add some more touches to it. Here are some ideas:\n\t* Arrange short, votive candles around the centerpiece. Scatter glass gems or metallic confetti around the centerpiece. Tie a satin or sheer ribbon around the base of the vessel.\n\n\n## Make an underwater vase\n\n1. Get a tall, glass, cylindrical vase. You can also use a square vase instead. You will be placing the entire rose inside the vase and then filling the vase all the way with water. Try to get a vase that is at least 12 inches (30.48-centimeters) tall. This will make your centerpiece look more elegant. Consider wrapping a crystal trim around the base of the vase. You can find it in the sticker or scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store.\n2. Trim a rose down until it is about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) shorter than the vase. You will need the extra space inside the vase for the floating candle. If the rose is too tall, it will stick out of the water/vase and ruin the effect. You can trim off the leaves or leave them on. Cut real roses with clean garden shears. Cut silk roses with wire cutters. If you chose to leave the leaves on a real rose, rinse them off under cool water. This will get rid of any dust that might muddy up the water.\n3. Insert the rose into a frog pin. A frog pin is a coin-sized metal disk with pins sticking out of it, like a hairbrush. You can find them in the floral section of an arts and crafts store. Try to wedge the rose's stem between the pins rather than straight into them. Consider adding a few more shorter roses into the pin. A frog pin is not absolutely necessary, but it will help keep the rose secure. If you cannot find a frog pin, you will have to add more vase filler later on.\n4. Place the rose into the bottom of the vase. For an added effect, consider turning on a submersible LED light, and adding it into the bottom of the vase as well. Make sure that the LED light is meant for being used in underwater floral arrangements. You can find them in the floral department of an arts and crafts shop.\n5. Fill the bottom of the vase filler. Scoop the filler out of the bag with your hands, then carefully spread it across the bottom of the vase. This will prevent the filler from damaging the rose's petals. Keep filling the vase until the frog pin is covered. You can use tiny acrylic pellets or crystals, of glass gems or marbles. If you weren't able to find a frog pin, fill the bottom of the vase with 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) of vase filler, or until the rose stands up on its own.\n6. Fill the vase with cool water. Stop when you are about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the rim of the vase. The entire rose, including the bloom, should be submerged under water.\n7. Place a floating candle on top. Make sure that the bottom of the candle does not bump up against the rose. If it does, add more water or trim the rose down. You can use a regular round candle or a rose-shaped one.\n8. Place the vase on your table. Consider scattering acrylic gems or metallic confetti around the vase. You can also make a few more vases that are taller or shorter than the one you just made.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "a creative, hands-on individual with an interest in gardening and home decor.

Make a plan to tackle the sources of pressure in your life. Utilizing the information from your stress journal, you may decide that you need a revised financial plan, a personal health plan or a work plan. The most important thing is to tackle the sources of pressure through a purposeful and detailed plan of action. Talk to your supervisor to create a plan of action to reduce the stressors you experience at work. Make a financial plan with specific targets, including not only long term savings or retirement goals but also near term goals that are concrete and achievable. Build up your emergency or rainy day fund. Make a fitness plan to improve your health.\n4. Overcome perfectionism. A huge source of pressure in life can be the desire to be perfect at everything. Have you ever been told that you have unrealistic standards at work? Do you ever feel you will never be able to live up to your own standards? If you answered yes to these questions, you may have difficulty with perfectionism. If so, try to loosen up your standards of achievement a little bit. This should help reduce your anxiety levels. If you feel disappointed with yourself, try repeating statements like \"nobody is perfect\" or \"I did my best\"\n\t* Try to think about your situation from a different angle. Ask yourself, will this situation still matter next month? If I told my brother or friend about this situation, would they think it matters as much as I do? Gain some perspective on your situation and maybe it won't seem quite as dire as it does right now.\n5. Create work-life boundaries so that you have time for yourself. Living in a digital age with constant access to screens - computers, tablets, smart phones - can make it difficult to escape the pressures of work. The pressure to be always online and accessible to colleagues can take a toll on work-life balance. To manage this kind of stress, it is helpful to create boundaries for yourself such as telling your colleagues you will be away from the phone or the computer at certain times of the day or on the weekend. Tell your colleagues you will be away from email and phone connectivity during dinner hours.\n6. Avoid comparing yourself to other people. If you're constantly trying to be someone you're not, you will feel stressed or burdened. Don't judge yourself based on how you think other people are living their life.Remind yourself that you have talents, skills, qualities, and good characteristics that are unique to you. Evaluate your goals and successes based on you want out of life, not what others want for you. Try to reduce how much time you spend on social media. People often post the best parts of their life on social media, so it may seem as though their lives are more perfect than they actually are.\n7. Give yourself some time away from work. If you are feeling burned out, it might be time for a personal day or even a vacation. Taking a vacation can actually help your productivity, and has obvious health benefits. If you don't have time for a vacation at the moment, try to at least take the weekend off to catch up on sleep. If you have vacation time or time off from work, take advantage of it. Those days are there for you to use them. A vacation might make you more productive.\n8. Set up an automatic 'out of office' reply on your email account. By setting up an automatic reply on weekends or when you are on vacation, you will not feel guilty for ignoring work emails. Also, your colleagues will be more likely to respect your away time. Include details on the days and times you are away in your 'out of office' automatic email reply. Include a fun or wise quote in your automatic reply so that colleagues will be reminded of your personality or sense of humour. This may reduce the annoyance of getting an automatic reply.\n\n\n## Take care of yourself\n\n1. Start a regular exercise routine. Exercise has been shown to reduce stress, improve feelings of well being and self esteem. Engaging in physical exercise leads to the production of the neurotransmitter endorphin, which is associated with improved sense of well being or what some people call runner's high. You don't need to be an athlete to experience this improved mood, and just 15 minutes a day can make a big difference..\n\t* After your exercise routine, try using a heat wrap around your neck and shoulders for 10 minutes to reduce tension in your upper body.\n2. Practice meditation. Find a comfortable place to sit in a quiet room or in a park. Observe the movement of your breath as it comes into your body and then flows out. Let go of passing thoughts. You can also do a walking meditation by walking slowly, preferably in a natural area, while watching your breath. Meditating for a few minutes a day can help reduce stress and anxiety. Deep, diaphragmatic breathing can reduce the heart rate and lower anxiety. [Image:Lessen the Pressure of Life Step 8.jpg|center]]\n\t* Meditate alongside your yoga practice and in your everyday life. Mindfulness-based stress reduction such as meditation and yoga are helpful in reducing stress and anxiety, including amongst college students.\n3. Eat whole plant foods as part of a healthy diet. Whole plant foods such as whole grains (e.g., brown rice), vegetables, and fruits are negatively associated with depression and anxiety. On the other hand, processed food (e.g., canned food) has been positively associated with stress and anxiety. Drink a cup of herbal tea.\n4. Ditch your second cup of coffee. Caffeine can exacerbate stress levels, so it is good to lower your caffeine intake as part of an overall stress reduction plan. Keep in mind that you may experience withdrawal symptoms, especially if you are a heavy coffee drinker.\n5. Cut down on sugar. Stress can make you crave sugary foods, but try to resist temptation. Giving in to these urges will not actually make you feel any better. Too much sugar can cause your blood sugar to crash, which can cause more stress and cravings.Sugary foods include most desserts, baked goods, soft drinks, juices, and candy.\n6. Reduce your consumption of alcohol. Although many turn to alcohol to deal with the everyday pressures of life, alcohol consumption can actually compound the impact of stress on the body and mind. Alcohol can also make your financial anxieties worse.\n\n\n## Gain perspective on life\n\n1. Talk to your friends and family about the sources of stress in your life and about everything you are grateful for. Face to face conversations with friends and family are especially important in helping reduce the pressures of life. Plan a movie night with close friends and pick a comedy! Laughing lowers cortisol which is the body's stress hormone. Go to a concert with friends. Listening to music can help reduce stress. So why not make a night of it and decompress with friends and music you love.\n2. Use positive thinking and self-talk to ward off stress. For instance, if you are experiencing a lot of stress at work due to an impending deadline, remember to tell yourself, \u201cI can overcome this hurdle\u201d\n3. Avoid trying to control everything in your life. Sometimes, there are surprises in life. You can't always predict or control what will happen. Letting go of the need to control everything can help you become happier and more at peace with the world.\n4. Express yourself through art therapy. Tapping into your creative side can help you work through the anxiety of everyday life. Using art therapy techniques, preferably alongside an art therapist, you can use drawing, painting, or music to express your inner feelings in more nuanced ways than may be possible with words alone. You don't have to be an artist to enjoy the benefits of creative self expression, including in relation to stress reduction.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual seeking practical advice and strategies to manage stress and improve their overall well-being.

{"conversations": ["How to buy school supplies?", "Shopping for school supplies can be stressful for both the seasoned shopper and the beginner. Working parents or guardians have to fight the crowds that gather on weekends or after the end of the workday. Even worse, the cost of school supplies steadily increases every year, costing families an average of just under $100 in 2015. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to stress out or go bankrupt. By spacing out your purchases and practicing a few money-saving hacks, you can survive the back-to-school madness.\n\n## Buy basic supply\n\n1. Get a list from your child\u2019s school. Don\u2019t rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isn\u2019t available on the school\u2019s website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites.\n2. Know the difference between requests and requirements. Before you panic over the long supply list on the school\u2019s website, realize that many of the items are merely requests. One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.\n3. Purchase writing supplies. Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper. Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art. Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but it\u2019s always a good idea to check the supply list in case your child\u2019s teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners. Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.\n4. Buy folders. Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc. ).\n5. Purchase a day planner. Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.\n6. Buy art supplies. Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.\n7. Purchase personal supplies. Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack. Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.\n8. Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag. Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time. However, textbooks haven\u2019t gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.\n\n\n## Shop for electronics\n\n1. Buy a calculator. High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:\n\t* Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30. Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.\n2. Purchase a computer. High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list. Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget.\n3. Buy external storage. Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.\n\n\n## Save money\n\n1. Sort out what you already have. Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldn\u2019t mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s). Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt. Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.\n2. Stick to basics and generics. Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Don\u2019t worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs.\n3. Take advantage of discounts. Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back. Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.\n4. Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks. Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.\n5. Buy refurbished. Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost. However, you should do your homework first. Only buy refurbished products from trusted retailers like Apple or Best Buy, which offer warranties and free repairs on known issues.\n6. Buy a little at a time throughout the year. There\u2019s no rule that you have to buy school supplies in July and August. Each time you\u2019re shopping for groceries or picking up a prescription, stop by the school supply aisle to look for unannounced discounts on common required supplies.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally-conscious small business owner or manager seeking practical strategies to minimize their carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable future.

{"conversations": ["How to wax your armpits?", "Waxing your armpits may be more painful than shaving, but it keeps your armpits hairless for 4-6 weeks. You can reduce the pain and prevent ingrown hairs from occurring by preparing your armpits and using the right kind of wax.\n\n## Get ready to wax\n\n1. Prepare your underarms. You can wax your armpits without making a lot of preparations, but if you take these measures the experience will be less painful and more effective:\n\t* Clean your underarms thoroughly. Wash them with soap or a good body wash, and scrub them a little to exfoliate the skin. If you use hot water, the hairs and surrounding skin will soften, making the hairs easier to remove. Trim the hair. If the hair under your arms is longer than \u20444 inch (0.6 cm), you should trim it with a pair of barber or nail scissors until it's \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) long. This makes the waxing process less painful.\n2. Wrap yourself up in an old towel. The wax is bound to spill and create a mess when you try to do it yourself, so it's best to be either naked or wrapped in something you don't mind getting impregnated with wax.\n3. Powder your underarms. Any talcum powder would do. Take a big sponge and spread the talc over the area, making sure to remove the excess powder.\n4. Heat up body wax. Make sure you use wax that is intended to be used to remove leg and body hair, rather than wax intended for use on the face. Follow the instructions on the package and heat the wax in the microwave or in a wax heater. It's ready to use when it's completely melted and runny. If this is your first time waxing, do a test on the back of your hand, where your skin is less sensitive, to make sure the wax isn't too hot. Body wax kits are available at drugstores and beauty supply stores. You can make your own sugar-based body wax using the following recipe: mix 2 cups of sugar with 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup lemon juice. Heat the mixture over low heat on the stove until the sugar dissolves and becomes a sticky syrup. The mixture is now ready to use.\n\n\n## Apply the wax\n\n1. Use a waxing stick to apply wax to your armpit. Load it with a good amount of hot wax, then swipe it on your armpit in the direction of your hair growth. Continue swiping, always in the same direction, until all of the hair is covered with wax. Some people have hair that grows in more than one direction. If this is the case with you, you'll have to wax your armpit one section at a time. Do not swipe the wax in the opposite direction. Your hair strands will get tangled up and won't pull out cleanly.\n2. Apply a wax strip. Take one of the paper wax strips that came with your kit. Place it over the area with the wax and swipe it once with your hand, in the direction of your hair growth, to position it in place. If you made your own sugar wax, use a clean piece of cotton cloth as a wax strip. Leave the edge of the strip free of the wax, so you can grasp it to pull it off. If you can't cover all of the wax with one strip, work one at a time.\n3. Remove the strip. Grasp the strip by the free edge and pull quickly against the direction of your hair growth. The strip, wax, and hair should come right off. Repeat the process with the other armpit. If the wax and hair don't come off, you'll have to try again. Use a fresh wax strip. If the process is too painful, remove the wax with olive oil and warm water, and plan to shave instead of waxing.\n\n\n## Finish the job\n\n1. Examine your armpits in the mirror. If you see bits of remaining hair, apply more wax, smooth on a wax strip, and rip it off.\n2. Remove excess wax with oil. Use the oil that came with your waxing kit or a bit of olive or almond oil to rub the areas you waxed. The oil will loosen the wax from your skin, making it easy to peel it off without pain.\n3. Clean the area. Once all of the wax has been removed, wash your armpits with warm water and a mild soap. You can apply aloe if your armpits are still stinging. If the waxing caused you to bleed, put on a small bandage until the bleeding has subsided. Do not use deodorant, moisturizer, or other creams and lotions for several hours after waxing.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A young adult or teenage girl who is interested in personal grooming and beauty, possibly exploring new methods for hair removal.

A rabbit can fill up on it (because of the bulk), but still need food because they didn't get enough calories, vitamins, minerals, etc.\nIf you look at the USDA's webpage on iceberg lettuce. You'll notice that water makes up just about 95% of the nutrients, leaving 5% to be divided up between every other nutrient.

Iceberg lettuce has only 14 calories per 100 grams (2 calories or less in each leaf), and 18mg of calcium.\nOther effects to consider, is when fed straight from the fridge, lettuce will be cold and wet, both are conditions that can upset a pet's stomach.\nIn addition, since most rabbit breeders do not feed lettuce to their baby rabbits, it is an unfamiliar food and if the rabbit owner does not add lettuce to the diet gradually, it will cause stomach upset.\nFinally, it is often believed amoung rabbit breeders that\n\nRabbits should not eat some lettuces (such as iceberg) as they contain a substance called laudanum which can be harmful in large quantities.\n\nRSPCA: Rabbit Diet Myths\nBut this is disputed because\n\nLettuce does not contain laudanum.

{"conversations": ["Why isn't Sectumsempra an Unforgivable Curse?", "Not many people knew Sectumsempra - they'd need to know it exists to  ban it.\nSeverus Snape invented Sectumsempra while at Hogwarts, and wrote it down in his Potions book. He doesn't seem to have told many people about it, it's possible he didn't tell anyone at all.\n\n\u201cHarry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned \u2018For Enemies\u2019, that he had marked a few weeks previously.\u201d - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 24 (Sectumsempra)\n\nHis book was hidden away until Harry found it, and Harry didn't tell the rest of the wizarding world about it either. Severus himself was seen using Sectumsempra when the Order was moving seven Harrys, and Harry had used it a few times after he found it in Snape's old book. Lupin knows of it, since he described it as one of Snape's specialties.\nHowever, they are probably some of the only people who know it - it isn't widely known like the three Unforgivable Curses. No one else, either in the Death Eaters or the Order of the Phoenix, is ever said to use it.  It's likely that the Ministry didn't even know of it. Therefore, the Ministry wouldn't have even been able to make the decision to classify it as an Unforgivable Curse, since they would likely not have even known it existed.\nIf the Ministry knew about it, would it be classified as Unforgivable?\nThe reason it wasn't classified as an Unforgivable Curse is because the Ministry wouldn't have known about it - they would be unable to make any decision on something they don't know exists. That, by itself, doesn't say whether the Ministry would classify it as one if they knew about it.\nNot all potentially harmful spells are classified as Unforgivable Curses.\nIt's nowhere near guaranteed, though, that if the Ministry knew about Sectumsempra, that they'd classify it as an Unforgivable Curse. There are other spells that could clearly do harm. Just to give a few examples - Confringo, Flagrante, and the creation of Fiendfyre are all potentially harmful but not Unforgivable.\nIt's never mentioned why those three curses are classified as Unforgivable and others aren't, but it seems likely that it's because there are little to no uses for them that aren't evil. The punishment for using an Unforgivable Curse is a lifetime sentence in Azkaban, so only the worst curses, that are highly unlikely to ever have a non-Dark use, would be made Unforgivable.\n\n\u201cNow \u2026 those three curses \u2013 Avada Kedavra, Imperius and Cruciatus \u2013 are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban.\u201d - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 14 (The Unforgivable Curses)\n\nNow, would Sectumsempra fit the criteria for being made an Unforgivable Curse?\nProbably not - it cuts through things like a sword. It can be used for anything a sword, knife or other cutting tool can be used for. While using it on people might be considered Unforgivable, the spell itself is simply the act of cutting. There are many things a wizard might reasonably want to cut with no malicious intent; vegetables, rope, cloth, building materials. Because of this, it seems unlikely that even if the Ministry had known about it, it would be classified as an Unforgivable Curse.\nIn addition, there is a countercurse for Sectumsempra.\n\n\u201cPushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand and traced it over the deep wounds Harry\u2019s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song.

{"conversations": ["How to backpack in the rain?", "## Deal with a sudden storm\n\n1. Put on any protective gear that you\u2019ve brought. All hikers should carry lightweight rain gear or at least a poncho in case of rain. If you don\u2019t have these items, try to use what you do have, such as an extra garbage back that you carried just in case or a tarp.\n2. Keep your body moving. Even if you\u2019re trying to stay out of the rain, move around as you wait so that your body stays warmer. For example, march in place or step side to side. Hypothermia can easily set in if you get too cold, so generate as much body heat as you can.\n3. Seek shelter. Look around you for a place to duck out of the rain, such as a tree canopy, a cave, a cabin, or even your tent. If you plan on camping and have a waterproof tent, you may find that settling in early and riding out the storm is the best solution. If you hear thunder, seek immediate shelter. Staying outside during a thunder storm is dangerous.\n4. Watch for changes in the terrain. Rain can cause flooding, mud slides, rock slides, and slippery trails, all of which can be very dangerous. Look for signs such as flowing water, rising tide lines, shifting soil, and a sheen on the surface of the trail. When in doubt, walk away from the questionable terrain.\n5. Stay away from open fields, elevated areas, and water. If you\u2019re caught in a lightning storm, the most dangerous places to be include open areas, hills, mountains, trees, cliffs, and waterways. Lightning is most likely to strike these areas, so avoid them. If you\u2019re in the woods, try to find a small grove of trees that are surrounded by other taller trees. Tuck yourself in the lowest spot you can find. If you are stuck in an open area, look for the lowest spot, crouch down, and keep most of your body from touching the ground. Ideally, just the soles of your feet will make contact with the ground. If you have access to a vehicle, stay inside of it but try not to touch the sides of the car.\n6. Put down your trekking poles or other long objects. In a lightning storm, trekking poles and long, pointy objects make a great conductor for the lightning and are therefore very dangerous. Protect yourself by laying these items on the ground away from you.\n7. Pay attention to changing weather. Check the forecast before and during your trek, and watch for signs of a coming storm. If winds pick up and the sky becomes overcast, consider changing your route so that you can reach safety before the storm hits. It\u2019s better to cut your trek short and have the storm pass over rather than get caught in dangerous weather.\n\n\n## Plan a trek in a rainy environment\n\n1. Choose the right insulation for rainy weather. If you wear natural insulators like down or clothing made from cotton, the water seeps into the fabric and takes away the warmth. These fabrics can pull the heat from your body. Wool, fleece, and synthetics stay warm even in a downpour, so they are a better option if you know the weather will be rainy.\n2. Dress in layers. Stay warm by wearing long sleeved wool, polyester, or microfiber clothing under your rain gear. If the weather will also be cooler, add multiple layers. Your clothes will likely still get wet under your rain gear, but fabrics like wool and fleece can remain warm. On the other hand, you may want to look for items that dry easily, such as polyester. Choose items that will feel comfortable and flexible under your heavy raincoat. Avoid cotton, which will hold the water and drain your heat.\n3. Wear a hard shell raincoat and rain pants. A hard shell raincoat will hold up better than a soft shell raincoat in a sustained storm. You can protect your legs with rain pants or vented pants, depending on the temperature of the area and your preference as a hiker. Vented pants will be less insulating but dry quickly. Rain pants can help keep in your warmth and repel water, but they will eventually succumb to the onslaught of water.\n4. Choose the right shoes. For shorter backpacking trips, waterproof boots and gaiters are your best bet, while longer trips are best accomplished with breathable trail runners. If you\u2019re in the rain for long periods of time, your feet are going to get wet no matter what shoe you wear. Trail runners are easier on your feet and dry quicker than other options.\n5. Wear a hat. Your weakest link in staying warm is your head. Even with a hood, heat will escape from your head. Keep your head warm by wearing a hat. If you choose a hat that has a brim, you can also keep some of the rain off your face.\n6. Use a waterproof bag or use a pack cover. While they\u2019re expensive, waterproof bags far outrank pack covers in keeping your gear dry. A pack cover can easily be compromised by a wayward branch, which can pull off the cover. Additionally, water can still seep into the unprotected back of the bag. While a waterproof pack is preferable, a pack cover is better than nothing. Line the inside of your bag with a heavy-duty garbage bag.\n7. Protect your gear inside plastic bags. Protect items that need to stay dry, such as food, electronics, your map, your light source, etc. into plastic Ziplock bags, heavy-duty trash bags, or dry bags made for backpackers. If you are carrying a sleeping bag, tent, or other related items, make sure they are protected as well.\n8. Pack a set of dry clothes. If you\u2019re camping, make sure that you have a set of dry clothes to sleep in so that you can change out of your wet gear overnight. Not only will you be more comfortable, but it will help you keep your body temperature regulated. Store your dry clothes in plastic with your other dry gear.\n\n\n## Stay safe on rainy trail\n\n1. Choose a good trail. If you know that the weather will be rainy, choose an area that you can enjoy in the rain, such as a trek through the forest. Consider visibility and safety, since waterways can flood and rocks can become slippery. When in doubt, plan to keep your hiking short and bed down early.\n2. Avoid opening your pack. Each time you open your pack water drips in. Even if it\u2019s only a small amount of water, it can quickly compromise your pack. The water will remain in your waterproofed pack for the entire trek, so don\u2019t risk lugging around the unnecessary weight. Store frequently needed items and your snacks in pockets or in dry bags attached to the outside of your pack.\n3. Make sure that your map stays dry. If you don\u2019t have a waterproof map, then make sure that your map never gets wet. Ideally, it should be secured in a plastic see-through bag. Try not to remove it when it\u2019s exposed to rain.\n4. Snack often. Regularly munching on snacks will help you keep your body warmer, which is important when you\u2019re getting wet. Rain can cause hypothermia if you get too cool, so plan to eat more often than on a dry hike.\n5. Apply oils to your feet. The wetness from your socks can rub away your natural skin oils, which is what causes blisters. Applying a light salve to your feet can help prevent this from happening. Carry a salve and smooth it onto your feet when you settle in for the night.\n6. Stay hydrated. When it\u2019s raining, some hikers forget to drink their water. Even if you don\u2019t feel thirsty, make sure that you\u2019re sipping on your water to keep yourself hydrated. Dehydration can quickly become an issue.\n7. Take short breaks. Rainy weather makes breaks less desirable because it allows your body to cool down, causing you to be cold and uncomfortable. You also have the incentive to keep going until you reach your destination and can get out of the rain. However, not taking breaks can easily tire you out. Stay energized by taking shorter breaks than you normally would but more often. For example, if you would normally take a 15-minute break after hiking for an hour and a half, take a five-minute break every 30 minutes.\n8. Avoid placing wet gear in your tent. When you do stop to camp, keep your wet items separate from your dry items. Carrying wet gear into your tent can easily lead to everything being wet. Instead, cover up your gear and leave it outside the tent.\n9. Give your feet a chance to dry. When you stop to camp or to take an extended break, take off your shoes so that your feet have a chance to dry out. If you have dry socks, put them on. Otherwise, leave your feet bare. This will help keep your skin healthy and avoid blisters.\n10. Watch for the signs of hypothermia. Rain can lead to hypothermia, even if it\u2019s not very cold out. Stay safe by monitoring yourself for signs of hypothermia. If you do notice any, take steps to warm yourself, such as pitching camp and changing your wet clothes for dry ones. Symptoms of mild hypothermia include shivering, slurred speech, tiredness, cool or pale skin, and shallow breathing. Symptoms of moderate hypothermia include confusion, drowsiness, tiredness, shallow breathing, cold or pale skin, ceasing of shivering, and shedding clothes despite being cold.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An outdoor enthusiast or hiker with experience in backpacking, particularly in wet or rainy conditions.

{"conversations": ["How to buy school supplies?", "Shopping for school supplies can be stressful for both the seasoned shopper and the beginner. Working parents or guardians have to fight the crowds that gather on weekends or after the end of the workday. Even worse, the cost of school supplies steadily increases every year, costing families an average of just under $100 in 2015. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to stress out or go bankrupt. By spacing out your purchases and practicing a few money-saving hacks, you can survive the back-to-school madness.\n\n## Buy basic supply\n\n1. Get a list from your child\u2019s school. Don\u2019t rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isn\u2019t available on the school\u2019s website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites.\n2. Know the difference between requests and requirements. Before you panic over the long supply list on the school\u2019s website, realize that many of the items are merely requests. One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.\n3. Purchase writing supplies. Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper. Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art. Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but it\u2019s always a good idea to check the supply list in case your child\u2019s teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners. Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.\n4. Buy folders. Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc. ).\n5. Purchase a day planner. Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.\n6. Buy art supplies. Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.\n7. Purchase personal supplies. Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack. Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.\n8. Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag. Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time. However, textbooks haven\u2019t gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.\n\n\n## Shop for electronics\n\n1. Buy a calculator. High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:\n\t* Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30. Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.\n2. Purchase a computer. High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list. Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget.\n3. Buy external storage. Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.\n\n\n## Save money\n\n1. Sort out what you already have. Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldn\u2019t mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s). Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt. Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.\n2. Stick to basics and generics. Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Don\u2019t worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs.\n3. Take advantage of discounts. Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back. Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.\n4. Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks. Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.\n5. Buy refurbished. Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost. However, you should do your homework first. Only buy refurbished products from trusted retailers like Apple or Best Buy, which offer warranties and free repairs on known issues.\n6. Buy a little at a time throughout the year. There\u2019s no rule that you have to buy school supplies in July and August. Each time you\u2019re shopping for groceries or picking up a prescription, stop by the school supply aisle to look for unannounced discounts on common required supplies.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmentally-conscious small business owner or manager seeking practical strategies to minimize their carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable future.

{"conversations": ["Prove that the union of countably many countable sets is countable.", "Let's start with a quick review of \"countable\". A set is countable if we can set up a 1-1 correspondence between the set and the natural numbers. As an example, let's take $\\mathbb{Z}$, which consists of all the integers. Is $\\mathbb Z$ countable?\n\nIt may seem uncountable if you pick a naive correspondence, say $1 \\mapsto 1$, $2 \\mapsto 2 ...$, which leaves all of the negative numbers unmapped. But if we organize the integers like this:\n$$0$$\n$$1, -1$$\n$$2, -2$$\n$$3, -3$$\n$$...$$\n\nWe quickly see that there is a map that works. Map 1 to 0, 2 to 1, 3 to -1, 4 to 2, 5 to -2, etc. So given an element $x$ in $\\mathbb Z$, we either have that $1 \\mapsto x$ if $x=0$, $2x \\mapsto x$ if $x > 0$, or $2|x|+1 \\mapsto x$ if $x . So the integers are countable.\n\nWe proved this by finding a map between the integers and the natural numbers. So to show that the union of countably many sets is countable, we need to find a similar mapping. First, let's unpack \"the union of countably many countable sets is countable\":\n1. \"countable sets\" pretty simple. If $S$ is in our set of sets, there's a 1-1 correspondence between elements of $S$ and $\\mathbb N$.\n2. \"countably many countable sets\" we have a 1-1 correspondence between $\\mathbb N$ and the sets themselves. In other words, we can write the sets as $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$... Let's call the set of sets $\\{S_n\\}, n \\in \\mathbb N$.\n3. \"union of countably many countable sets is countable\". There is a 1-1 mapping between the elements in $\\mathbb N$ and the elements in $S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup S_3 ...$\n\nSo how do we prove this? We need to find a correspondence, of course. Fortunately, there's a simple way to do this. Let $s_{nm}$ be the $mth$ element of $S_n$. We can do this because $S_n$ is by definition of the problem countable. We can write the elements of ALL the sets like this:\n$$s_{11}, s_{12}, s_{13} ...$$\n$$s_{21}, s_{22}, s_{23} ...$$\n$$s_{31}, s_{32}, s_{33} ...$$\n$$...$$\nNow let $1 \\mapsto s_{11}$, $2 \\mapsto s_{12}$, $3 \\mapsto s_{21}$, $4 \\mapsto s_{13}$, etc. You might notice that if we cross out every element that we've mapped, we're crossing them out in diagonal lines. With $1$ we cross out the first diagonal, $2-3$ we cross out the second diagonal, $4-6$ the third diagonal, $7-10$ the fourth diagonal, etc. The $nth$ diagonal requires us to map $n$ elements to cross it out. Since we never \"run out\" of elements in $\\mathbb N$, eventually given any diagonal we'll create a map to every element in it. Since obviously every element in $S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup S_3 ...$ is in one of the diagonals, we've created a 1-1 map between $\\mathbb N$ and the set of sets.\n\nLet's extend this one step further. What if we made $s_{11} = 1/1$, $s_{12} = 1/2$, $s_{21} = 2/1$, etc? Then $S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup S_3 ... = \\mathbb Q^+$! This is how you prove that the rationals are countable.

{"conversations": ["How to prepare for a vaginoplasty?", "A vaginoplasty is a surgical procedure that reconstructs or tightens the outer and inner muscles of your vagina, which can become weak and loose over time. It may improve your comfort levels and symptoms of incontinence. Some even claim it can boost sexual pleasure though this is not well studied and highly individual. A vaginoplasty can also create a vagina if you're undergoing gender-affirming surgery. You can prepare for a vaginoplasty by visiting your doctor, arranging your surgery, planning your recovery, and following pre-op requirements. For gender affirming surgery, you'll work with your doctor to prepare for surgery.\n\n## Visit your doctor\n\n1. Talk to your doctor about the procedure. Your doctor can fully explain the procedure, as well as what you can expect afterward. They'll also discuss the risks of the surgery. Tell your doctor why you want the surgery so that they can help you avoid disappointment. The doctor will ask about your health and well-being before approving you for the procedure. Bring a detailed medical history, including conditions you're being treated for. Tell the doctor if you're seeing a therapist. If you're undergoing treatment for a condition related to your decision to get a vaginoplasty, such as body image issues, it's best to tell the doctor. Provide the doctor with a list of any medications you're taking, including the dosage amounts. Ask about your needs post-surgery. This includes what you should expect at the hospital and during the days after the surgery.\n2. Get a blood test. Your doctor will want to do a few simple tests to make sure you're healthy enough for surgery. First, they'll do a simple blood test, which is virtually painless. This lets them check your hemoglobin and health profile to ensure that you are healthy. They may also do a pregnancy test, as you won't be able to get a vaginoplasty if you're pregnant.\n3. Undergo a urine test. The doctor will also do a urinalysis to make sure that you're healthy. This is a simple, painless test. You'll just need to urinate in a cup, and the medical staff will take care of the rest!\n4. Confirm that you aren't pregnant and don't want more kids. You should not get a vaginoplasty if you want to have more children or if you're pregnant. In this case, it's best for you to wait until you're finished having children. Your doctor will likely ask you to confirm that you aren't pregnant and don't plan to become pregnant. The doctor may also choose to do a pregnancy test before allowing you to get the surgery.\n\n\n## Arrange your surgery\n\n1. Contact your insurance provider to check your coverage. Many insurance companies won't cover a vaginoplasty, as it's usually considered an elective procedure. This means you may have to pay for it out of pocket. If you're not sure you can afford the procedure, ask your doctor if they offer a payment plan. You can also look into CareCredit, a line of credit opened specifically for elective medical procedures. CareCredit requires an application similar to that of most credit cards.\n2. Make a budget for how you'll pay for the procedure. Factor in the cost of the procedure, your pre-op and follow-up appointments, pharmacy costs, and the time you'll need to take off work. Determine where you'll get the money, such as from savings or by borrowing. Some of your appointments could be covered by insurance, so you may not need to pay these out of pocket. In the United States, a vaginoplasty typically costs between $4,500 and $8,500.\n3. Plan the surgery in between menstrual periods if applicable. You cannot get a vaginoplasty while you're on your period. The best time to have the surgery is right after your period, which allows you as much recovery time as possible before your next period starts.\n4. Take photos of your genitals before the surgery. Your doctor may also want a set of photos. This allows you and your doctor to see the difference before and after your surgery.\n5. Make your surgical appointment. It usually takes several months to a year from your initial consultation to get your surgery. You should find out your surgery date about 2-3 months before it will occur. Your doctor can provide you more information about your unique case.\n\n\n## Plan your recovery\n\n1. Schedule time off of work. You'll need at least a few days to recover, but how long you should take off depends on your job demands. It's a good idea to request at least a calendar week. If your job is very physically demanding, you may want to take off longer. Ask your doctor how long you should take off. If you'll lose part of your income, make a special budget to help you cover your living costs.\n2. Ask someone to come help you. You'll need help as soon as your surgery is over. Someone will need to drive you home and help you take care of your needs. This includes getting any additional medications, preparing meals, helping care for pets, and completing household chores. It's best to arrange this help ahead of time. If possible, recruit a few friends or loved ones to act as a support system following your surgery. You can also hire a professional home-care nurse to help you in the days following your procedure.\n3. Create a pain treatment plan to make your recovery easier. It's normal to experience some pain after surgery, but luckily it's possible to minimize it. Planning beforehand can make it easier to treat your pain so that your recovery goes as smoothly and as painlessly as possible. Discuss pain medicine with your doctor. Obtain an over-the-counter pain reliever, if recommended. Ask your doctor if a prescription pain reliever might be right for you. You could also purchase a heating pad or single-use heat packs to help manage your pain.\n4. Stock your fridge and freezer with healthy, easy to prepare meals. Cooking will be hard following surgery, so it's a good idea to have lots of easy options at home. You could make meals ahead of time or use commercial microwaveable dinners. Alternatively, you could have someone cook for you, if this is an option.\n5. Plan mood boosters for your downtime. After your surgery, you'll need to take a break from regular life for a few days. Gather a few activities to occupy your mind during this time, like a book, coloring book, or favorite TV show. It's a good idea to collect a few easy-to-access options so that it's easier to keep your mood up while you recover. Check out a few new releases from the library. Get an adult coloring book or download a coloring app. Add a new comedy to your watchlist on your favorite streaming site. Place your iPad and other devices, including chargers, near your recovery area for easy access.\n6. Purchase menstruation pads if you're still menstruating. You won't be able to use a tampon or menstrual cup for 4-6 weeks after your surgery. Menstruation pads are an easy alternative while you're in recovery. Ask your doctor before you resume using tampons or a menstrual cup. Your muscles must be healed before these methods are an option for you.\n7. Talk to your partner about sex after the surgery. You'll need to avoid sex for 4-6 weeks while your vagina heals. Make sure your partner understands this wait, and discuss ways you two can be intimate without having sex. Visit your doctor for a check-up before you engage in sexual activity. The doctor needs to examine your vagina and clear you for sex.\n\n\n## Follow pre-op recommendations\n\n1. Stop taking aspirin and blood thinners 1 week prior to surgery. All surgeries increase your bleeding risk. Blood thinners can further increase this risk by making it harder for your blood to clot. Over-the-counter aspirin or ibuprofen pain relievers can thin your blood, so you shouldn't take them before your surgery. You may also need to stop taking vitamins and supplements. Tell your doctor what you're taking so that they can advise you. If you are taking a prescription blood thinner, talk to your doctor about when you should decrease your dosage. Don't stop taking it until you talk to your doctor.\n2. Avoid smoking in the weeks before your surgery. Smoking can slow your recovery time. This is because it narrows your veins and makes it harder for blood to flow. This means that your blood isn't able to effectively deliver oxygen throughout your body, which is necessary during recovery. Your doctor may decide to check your urine to make sure that you have quit. It's best to stop smoking at least 8 weeks prior to having your surgery.\n3. Shave your genital area before surgery. This makes it easier for the doctor to complete the procedure. It can also reduce your chance of infection. If you don't shave the area beforehand, the medical team may do it prior to beginning your operation.\n4. Follow your pre-op procedures. The doctor will instruct you on what to do in the days leading up to the surgery. The day before surgery, you may be instructed to fast. It's best to eat a hearty breakfast that morning, as the rest of the day you may only be allowed clear liquids. Your pre-op plan may also include the following:\n\t* A bowel cleanse\n\t* Fasting, with clear liquids\n\t* Drinking more than 8 glasses of water\n\t* Rest\n\t* Nothing ingested by mouth after the midnight prior to surgery\n5. Do relaxation techniques to cope with stress or worry. It's normal to worry before undergoing surgery. It's a good idea to spend some time relaxing the night before the surgery. Perform deep breathing exercises. Meditate. Stretch or do yoga. Color in an adult coloring book or app. Go for a walk outdoors if the weather is nice. Soak in a warm bath.\n6. Plan for an overnight stay at the hospital. You may be able to leave the hospital a few hours after your surgery, but many doctors will hold you overnight. Pack an overnight bag with a change of clothes, a light robe, slippers, and any toiletries you think you may need.\n\n\n## Prepare for gender affirm surgery\n\n1. Discuss the risks and options. Gender-affirming surgery is not right for everyone. It can be expensive and is irreversible. Your doctor and a therapist can help you decide if the benefits of getting gender affirming surgery outweigh the risks in your case. A therapist will determine if you're mentally healthy enough to undergo the procedure. They'll also consider how long you've wanted to get the procedure. Before you're approved, you'll have to show that you've been living as a woman for at least a year, including taking appropriate hormones.\n2. Obtain two letters of support from qualified mental health professionals. Each letter must be written by a mental health professional who is experienced in working with transgender individuals. You can search online for a qualified therapist near you using a site like Psychology Today. The letters should confirm the following:\n\t* Your gender identification is persistent and well-documented\n\t* You're competent to choose the surgery and consent to treatment\n\t* You're of legal age\n\t* You're being treated for any mental health conditions\n\t* You've been undergoing hormone treatment\n3. Plan to take extra time off work. It usually takes about 2 months to fully recover from gender-affirming surgery. At the very least, you'll need to stay home for the week after surgery. If you must go back after that week, however, it's best to arrange a lighter workload. If it's possible, ask your boss if you can have a flexible schedule or work from home. If you work a field job, ask for desk duty for a few weeks. You could also try working part-time. Check with your doctor before going back to work.\n4. Ask your doctor when you should stop taking your hormones. You'll need to stop taking your hormones before you can undergo the surgery. Each surgeon will make their own recommendation. In general, you can expect to stop taking them about 3 weeks before your surgery.\n5. Talk to your partner about sex post-surgery. After gender affirming surgery, it will likely take 2 months to fully recover. You will need to avoid sex during this time. You can still be intimate in other ways, and it's a good idea to explore those options before your surgery.\n6. Remove the hair from your genital area. Check with your surgeon to find out what this will entail. For some, it may just mean shaving your genital area. However, some surgeons require you to get electrolysis hair removal prior to getting gender-affirming surgery.\n7. Expect to be in the hospital for about 5-7 days. Your doctor will likely admit you to the hospital a day or 2 before your surgery. You'll then need to remain in the hospital after your surgery for at least 3 nights. However, the entire length of your stay can vary. It's a good idea to ask your doctor what the average hospital stay is for their patients. In the days after your surgery, you'll likely experience some pain and discomfort in your vagina. The doctor can help manage your pain as you heal.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual who is considering or planning for gender affirmation surgery, specifically vaginoplasty.

{"conversations": ["How to tell if it's an acquaintance, friend, crush, or love?", "Feelings and emotions can be complex and difficult to understand, especially when trying to decipher those of someone you know.  Are you simply an acquaintance?  Do they consider you a friend?  Is it love or just a crush? There are many layers to relationships and it's not always clear where you stand with someone.  However, there are several different methods to decode how a person feels about you and perceives your relationship.\n\n## Read body language\n\n1. Notice the amount of eye contact. People\u2019s eyes can be very expressive and tell a lot about how they\u2019re feeling toward those around them. Friends will make eye contact with each other during conversation to show interest and respect. Someone with a crush on you will make repeated eye contact with you whether in a conversation or not. A crush may hold eye contact for a few seconds, and then look away from shyness, and find your gaze again later. Dilated pupils are another indication of a crush. Someone who\u2019s in love with you will feel totally comfortable locking gazes for extended periods of time.\n2. Gauge proximity. The amount of space people choose to place between themselves and others can be an indicator of their perceived relationships with those around them. Someone who is your friend will stand or sit closer to you than an acquaintance. A person with a crush on you will stand near you, lean toward you, and look for reasons to get closer to you- whether it\u2019s intentionally walking past you at a close range, or leaning in closer than necessary to talk to you. People who are in love will stand or sit very close together- perhaps their hips touch when standing side by side or their knees touch when sitting across from one another.\n3. Monitor movement. Our movements, whether conscious or unconscious, can convey lots of different meanings about how we feel about those around us. Friends will tilt their heads while in conversations with other friends to show that they\u2019re listening. They may touch each other in light, casual ways on the hand or arm. Someone with a crush will look for reasons to touch the other person, often in a playful and flirty way. They may seem fidgety or nervous, and may subconsciously begin to copy the movements of their crush. Someone who is in love with you will seem very comfortable and secure around you. They may touch you using gentle, caressing gestures.\n4. Pay attention to posture. The way a person stands (or sits) when they're around you may give you some clues as to how they feel about you. A friend will stand with his or her shoulders and face pointing toward you. If sitting, he or she will uncross his or her legs to show that he or she is open to you. His or her palms may be open toward you as well, another sign of receptivity. When someone has a crush on you, they stand tall and slightly stick their chest out. Additionally, they will point their toes and hips toward you, as a sign of wanting to move toward you (both figuratively and literally).\n\n\n## Listen for verbal cue\n\n1. Recognize vocal tone. The inflection and quality of a person\u2019s voice will change subconsciously depending on the feelings they have toward you. Listen to how someone talks in general, and compare it with they sound when talking to you individually. A friend\u2019s voice will remain constant, with little to no change in pitch or tone. A crush\u2019s voice will have a playful and flirtatious quality to it. Women use a higher pitch to accentuate their femininity. Men use a lower pitch, but alter the pitch, almost to a \u201csing-song\u201d tone, to both highlight masculinity, and make a woman feel at ease. People who are in love will alter their voices to match their partners\u2019. Men talk in a higher pitch and women a lower one to show that they are connected as one.\n2. Think about how casual your conversations are. A conversation between friends is usually casual and comfortable. Both you and your friend ask and answer questions equally, and may or may not make future plans to hang out.\n3. Notice how much they talk about themselves. If someone has a crush, they will talk a lot about themselves, both from nerves and as a way to \u201chumble-brag.\u201d They will also ask about you, and agree enthusiastically with what you say to make it seem like you have things in common.\n4. Analyze how intimate your conversations are. If someone is in love with you, they will open up to you in intimate ways. You may find out about their deep insecurities and fears, childhood, family dynamics, important personal values, and vision for the future. They may plan future vacations, or invite you to meet family.\n\n\n## Analyze your relationship\n\n1. Reflect on your relationship. Take some time in a quiet place simply to think about your feelings toward the person in question, and your interactions with them. Some questions to consider are:\n\t* How long have you known this person? How frequently do you see or talk to them? Is the communication equitable? What is the level of intimacy shared (either physically or conversationally)? How would you characterize your time together? Do you both seem to enjoy being together?\n2. Make a list. If you\u2019re trying to determine whether someone is a friend or a crush, make a \u201cFriend/Crush\u201d list. If you\u2019re figuring out whether someone is in love with you, make a \u201cLike/Love\u201d list. Like a Pro/Con list, record any specific behavior that would indicate how they feel about you. Having a visual aid way may give you more insight into how they feel.\n3. Ask a trusted friend for help. Sometimes our feelings toward someone can cloud our judgment in assessing their behavior. A friend can offer an honest, objective observation of the relationship, and will be less likely to allow personal feelings to affect their understanding.\n\n\n## Ask directly\n\n1. Express your feelings first. If you\u2019re asking someone to open up to you, then you need to be upfront with them as well. If you\u2019re looking for honesty, you need to show you\u2019re capable of reciprocating. People are more likely to be direct with you if you\u2019re direct with them. Start with a sentence like, \"I want you to know that I feel\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_about you/our relationship. I'm hoping you'll be just as honest and share your feelings about me.\"\n2. Ask in a tactful, non-threatening way. Explain that you\u2019re simply trying to gain some insight and clarity in your relationship, and that you respect their feelings no matter what. It\u2019s important for your partner to know that they can open up to you, without an abrasive reaction. Try saying something like, \"I want you to know that I will completely honor and respect your answer, even if it's not the one I want to hear.\"\n3. Be prepared for the consequences. There\u2019s a chance you and your partner may be on two different wavelengths in terms of your relationship. Their answer may sting a little. Take some time to decide how you want to proceed in the relationship, knowing exactly how your partner feels about you.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A young adult or teen seeking guidance on navigating interpersonal relationships.

Obtain a voter registration form at any public building. In Ohio, it\u2019s easy to obtain a copy of the registration paperwork. Visit any public library, any of the 88 county boards of elections, the office of the Secretary of State, or any public high school. Speak to someone at the main desk or secretarial office and ask for a copy of the voter registration form. If you don\u2019t live near to any public buildings, you can download a PDF copy of the registration form online at: https://www.sos.state.oh.us/globalassets/elections/forms/vr\\_form\\_04-2015.pdf. You must print the form, though; it cannot be filled out online.\n2. Fill out the entire form in blue or black ink. Provide your name, address, and the last 4 digits of your Social Security number. Write in either your Ohio Driver\u2019s License number or the last 4 digits of your SSN; you don\u2019t need to provide both numbers.

{"conversations": ["Why is FIFA against adding instant replay to the game?", "There are a few fundamental considerations:\n\n* Uncertainty is a part of the game. The referee and linesmen are the arbiters of the action. Instant replay would limit their authority.\n* Football is global. Many places do not have access to the technology necessary to implement instant replay.\n* Football is a fast-paced game with few opportunities for stoppage. Instant replay would unnecessarily slow the pace.\n\nIn 2008, FiFA President Sepp Blatter said:\n\n  \"Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still the referee makes the decision \u2013 a man, not a machine.\"\n\nBlatter and others at FIFA have repeatedly argued against using instant replay. But lately, FIFA has begun to come around on the idea. At FIFA's Congress in S\u00e3o Paulo prior to the 2014 World Cup, Blatter proposed allowing managers 2 challenges per game, much like the NFL handles challenges today.\nAlthough it's not quite \"instant replay,\" in 2012 FIFA approved two different goal-line technologies to improve referee accuracy: \"Hawk-Eye\" -- which uses visual triangulation to determine ball location -- and \"GoalRef\" -- which uses a microchip in the ball and magnetic sensors within goalposts. (Many say FIFA approved the technologies in response to Frank Lampard's snubbed \"goal\" against Germany in the 2010 World Cup.) In 2013, FIFA announced it would use GoalControl, a German competitor to Hawk-Eye, at the Confederations Cup, basically a rehearsal for the World Cup. After a successful run at that tournament, FIFA announced it would implement GoalControl at the 2014 World Cup.

{"conversations": ["How to write metal song lyrics?", "## Step\n\n1. Understand the meaning behind Metal Music. Metal is considered a \"counter-culture,\" meaning it opposes \"the normal, functional, and unexciting Culture that was dominant in society [and] by being outside of that which was in power, Counter-culturalists argued, they were able to see what was real.\" So when you before you begin writing, erase any preconceived notions that you have about a particular topic.\n2. Pick a topic. Metal music focuses on darker topics that match the heaviness of the music and skirt the \"popular\" beliefs of society. The topics often challenge the listeners' political, religious, emotional, philosophical, and/or social beliefs. Select a topic that you have experience with or have a strong connection to, this is going to make the rest of the process much easier. Popular topics for metal songs include war, personal angst, mental disease, mythology, tragedy, death, hate, intolerance, corruption and love.\n3. Brainstorm the topic. Once you have selected the topic, you want to spend time formulating what your thoughts on the subject are. Unlike popular music, metal pulls from real \"truths\" rather than perceived \"morals\" or popular \"beliefs\" on the subject. Start with what is \"society's perspective.\" Think of what the culture promotes as the correct \"belief\" or \"moral\" in the discussion of that topic. It will be easier if you can find a belief that you find to be counter-intuitive, paradoxical or illogical such \"war for peace,\" \"religiously-motivated murder,\" or \"victim-blaming.\" Contrast that to examples based on experience. Take a real life, personal or a fictional example that challenges the mainstream beliefs behind this topic. How has your experience challenged society's view? Make note of any other arguments, perspectives, or facts surrounding this topic. What kind of things do people say about the subject? What promotes these beliefs? What are the consequences behind this ethical belief? Who does this affect? Find a \"truth\" within the topic. Based solely on the examples that challenge that perspective, what truths can you logically pull out? This truth will become the main thrust of your song.\n4. Start to weave together the basic parts of the song. Unlike other popular music, there is not a standard song format such as \"verse-chorus-verse-chorus.\" Instead, create your own structure based on the topic. Is there an important message that can be repeated?Do you want to provide the listener with a resolution? Here are some basic elements of the dramatic structure you can include:\n\t* \n\t* What is the rising action? What examples or personal experiences can you include to bring the listener to agree with your song's main \"truth\"? What is the climax? Can you create a moment where the listener can throw out the societal norms or absolute \"morals\" that they had? What is the resolution? What did these examples teach the listener? What did you learn?\n5. Develop and formulate the lyrical poem. Don't stick to \"rhyming patterns\" or \"rules behind poetry.\" Many popular metal songs don't necessarily rhyme or follow traditionally. Instead just weave together the basic parts you created in the last step. Tell your \"story\" to the listener.\n6. Consider finding a literary device(s) to add depth to the song. Literary devices that work particularly well in metal music include personification, allegories, figurative language, imagery, metaphors and synecdoches. Some helpful ways to find out what devices will work with your topic include:\n\t* What popular images are associated with that topic? (Metaphors, allegories, personification, synecdoches, etc.) What observations can you pull from this topic? (Imagery, etc.) Is there fiction or mythology that you can pull from? (Metaphors, allegories, etc.)\n7. Develop the sound to go with the lyrics. Use wikiHow to Write Power Metal Music to create the sound behind your lyrics.\n8. Come back to the song, and revise as necessary. Sometimes the music doesn't match up with the sound. So play the music and sing the lyrics to find where these inconsistencies are. Then edit either the music or the sound to fit the emotion behind what you are saying/hearing.\n\n\n## Example: black sabbath's \"war pigs\"\n\n1. Black Sabbath set out to create Metal's counter-culture. Their fans were often disenfranchised youth who felt no connection to the free-love movement of the 1970s or the societal norms of the 1970s. They discussed topics that directly affected these youths and were relevant to what was going on in the world during that time.\n2. They choose the topic of war. This topic was perfect for the period where America used military force to achieve political change. In choosing this, they could speak out against the basic \"American\" beliefs behind the war effort. Societal beliefs: Society believed that war could bring peace. Experiences: War breeds more pain, suffering and destruction. Politicians start war, because they don't have to deal with those tragedies themselves. Other observations: It's the poor that fight, people die in masses, the generals guide soldier into certain death. The \"truth\": Politicians have the power and misuse it.\n3. Black Sabbath then started to weave together these basic ideas into the song, \"War Pigs\". They really focused less on rhyming and more on creating a vivid story with a rise, climax and a resolution. Rising Action: \"Generals gathered in their masses,\" \"In the fields the bodies burning,\" and \"Evil minds that plot destruction\" are all examples of realistic experiences and observations that Black Sabbath pulled from. Climax: \"Politicians hide themselves away\" and \"Wait 'til their judgement day comes\" support that from the examples, politicians will eventually be held responsible for what they did. Resolution: \"Now in darkness world stops turning,\" and \"No more war pigs have the power\" explain that eventually the people will rise up, and take back the power from the politicians. This provides a solution to the problems that existed in the rising action.\n4. Black Sabbath began to formulate these basic parts of the song together. Finding ways to make the lines fit together and to create a \"story.\" They tied the rising action to the climax with the \"oh lord yeah\" which foreshadows the resolution of judgement day.\n5. Literary devices were used to add depth to the song. Black Sabbath changed these experiences and facts surrounding war into something more meaningful and symbolic with literary devices. They weaved these ideas throughout the song, focusing on the main literary device of personification of \"war pigs.\" Popular images of \"tanks,\" \"machines,\" and \"battle fields\" are all references in the song. Observations like the masses being gathered and a chess game being played are also depicted. Fictitious and mythological images of \"sorcerers\" and \"witches\" are used in the song.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A musician, songwriter, or lyricist with a passion for metal music, seeking guidance on crafting compelling and authentic lyrics for their metal compositions.

{"conversations": ["How to be happy in an unhappy marriage?", "People remain in unhappy marriages for many reasons. If you're one of those people, you may feel like you can't be happy. Nonetheless, you can find your own way to happiness, even in a bad situation, by practicing habits that lead to happiness, and you may even be able to work on your marriage to move toward happiness as a couple.\n\n## Learn to be happy\n\n1. Find ways to be grateful. It's not always easy to be grateful, especially in the midst of a bad relationship. Nonetheless, gratitude can help you cope with the bad relationship, and it can lead to you being happier. Take time each day to figure out what you are thankful for. Try writing a few things you are grateful for each day in a journal. You can also use posts on social media for this purpose. Usually, even if the situation is bad, you can find something to be grateful about. For instance, you may not like how you are being treated in the relationship you are in, but you may be grateful to have financial stability in your life at the moment. Alternatively, maybe you're grateful that the other person in the relationship remains a good parent to your kids.\n2. Engage in flow experiences. Flow moments are when you lose yourself to an experience by being completely absorbed in whatever it is you're doing. If you're an artist, a writer, or even a runner, you may already understand this type of experience. It's that moment when the world falls away, and you are just experiencing or enjoying what you're doing. Studies have shown that the more flow moments you have, the happier you are in general. Choose an activity that challenges you a little bit, but that is still familiar so that you can lose yourself in it. For example, if you enjoy painting landscapes, then you might try painting a new subject such as a portrait or a basket of fruit.\n3. Stop fighting the same fights. That is, if you always find yourself arguing about the same things, it may be time to put that topic aside. You need to decide that you won't discuss it because you can't agree or try to find a compromise that works for both of you. For example, if you tend to fight over politics, then you might want to make politics an off-limits topic. Or, if you often fight about what movie you are going to watch on Friday nights, then you might want to take turns choosing the movie.\n4. Develop your own interests. If your marriage is not what you want it to be, it may be time to find some fulfillment outside of your marriage and not in the form of an affair. Having your own hobbies and interests will help you stay independent and keep you happy and engaged with the world. In fact, developing your own interests is a good idea even if you have a great marriage. Consider exploring interests at the library, joining local hobby clubs or cookery classes, or taking a vocational class at a nearby community college.\n5. Try volunteering. Having a sense of purpose and some good social connections with other people is also a good way to feel happy. Volunteering can give you a sense of purpose in life and it also allows you to interact with other like-minded people, it might help you to feel happier. Try to find an organization that you would like to contribute to, such as an animal shelter or a food bank, and apply to become a volunteer. You might even ask your spouse if he or she would like to volunteer with you and it might be a good bonding activity for the two of you.\n6. Develop your social life. Many studies point to relationships being key to happiness. If your main relationship is unhappy, then you may not see how you can change your situation. Your spouse doesn't have to be your main source of social interactions. You can have fulfilling relationships with friends, as well as other members of your family. Try to go out to dinner with friends one night per week or get together with a sibling or cousin for a day of shopping or a activity session such as tennis or swimming. If you don't have a lot of friends, then try to meet more people who share your interests. For example, you could join a bowling league, take an art class, or find a choir or band who need new members.\n\n\n## Work towards a better marriage\n\n1. Take time to be together. Making time for each other is a way to say you are committed to each other. Say you will spend a certain time each week with each other, and stick to it. It will also give you a chance to get to know one another again.\n2. Remember what you valued. When you first got together, you were probably partially attracted by the differences the other person exhibited. For instance, maybe you were exhilarated by the fact that he or she was impulsive and loved to be spontaneous. Now, you may find yourself hating the quality. The key is to try to remember why you loved that quality in the first place and move toward enjoying it again. For instance, it may drive you crazy when your spouse wants to drop everything and drive to the mountains. On the other hand, it keeps your life from getting too boring. Try to strike a balance, and enjoy what you can.\n3. Talk about strengths and difficulties. It is important to acknowledge what is going well in your relationship as well as what has become a struggle. You might even want to make a list of strengths and difficulties together. Make sure that you include things on the list that you avoid talking about because of fears that you will just end up fighting about them. Try to pick a time to talk about your strengths and difficulties when you are both feeling calm and focused. Avoid talking at the end of a long day or at other stressful times. Use \"I\" statements rather than \"You\" statements. In other words, try to talk about what you're feeling and what you think is wrong without blaming the other person. For instance, saying \"I get upset when we don't spend enough time together\" is better than \"You're never around.\" The second statement puts your spouse on guard, while the first helps open discussion. Spend time talking and listening. That is, you can't just lay out what you think is wrong. You also need to spend time actively listening to what your spouse has to say. Show you're engaged by offering short summaries of what he or she has said and by asking questions that are relevant to the conversation.\n4. Work out solutions. Once you've figured out together what issues you have in the marriage, it's time to try to come up with some solutions. You may even be able to draw on some of your strengths to help you develop solutions to problems in your relationships. To compromise, you must talk about your wants and needs, helping you both to decide what's most important to each of you. In other words, to make a compromise, you must be willing to let the other person win when it comes to their needs, giving ground when it comes in conflict with your wants. The same must be true of the other person.\n5. Think about counseling. Sometimes, you need the help of a professional to get past your problems. A marriage counselor may help you fix more problems than you expect, and in fact, about half of people who use marriage counselors say that the counselor helped them fix all of the major problems in their marriage.\n\n\n## Consider the alternative\n\n1. Try legal separation. A legal separation gives you the time away from your spouse that you may need to work out problems. It is different than a divorce because you remain married. The benefit of a separation is it gives you a legal way to work out custody and child support while you are living apart, as well as how your property should be divided up. Nonetheless, if you work out your problems, you can go back to a normal marriage.\n2. Know divorce may be a better option. While getting a divorce is a life upheaval, staying in an unhealthy marriage can be detrimental to self-esteem and mental health. Some studies have shown it's better to get out of a caustic relationship and work to improve your own mental health than to stay. Understand an unhappy marriage can lead to depression. One study, which involved data from 5,000 adults, showed that the quality of your most important relationship is a good predictor of developing depression. Meaning, if one of your closest relationships, including your spousal one, is in bad repair, it puts you at risk for developing depression.\n3. Consider reasons to divorce. You may find that you have a good reason for getting a divorce. If you are unhappy in your marriage, you will likely find that you are a happier person once you get out. You might consider a divorce if your spouse had an affair. While some couples overcome infidelity, others never recover from it. If you find that you can't forgive your spouse for what he or she did even after months or years, you may want to consider a divorce. You've grown in different ways. Sometimes, when you grow into full-fledged adults together, you take different directions. If you find you and your spouse can't agree on much of anything anymore because you are just too different, it may be best to divorce. Your partner is bad at finances and won't change. Of course, everyone makes bad money choices sometimes. However, if your partner is so bad that it is causing stress on your marriage or is bankrupting your family, you may need to get out of the marriage, especially if you've expressed concern but your spouse is unwilling to change. Think about the kids. Many unhappily married couples stay together for the kids. Divorce is hard on kids, but it's also true that being unhappily married can be hard on your kids, as well. Your kids know you're unhappy, and if you're constantly fighting, you're putting stress on them, anyway.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A person seeking advice or guidance on improving their marital relationship, possibly experiencing personal distress and seeking solutions to overcome challenges in their marriage.

{"conversations": ["How to drive economically?", "Everyone needs to use a car from time to time, but gas can be expensive. Driving more economically can save you money and keep your car\u2019s parts from wearing quickly. By avoiding aggressive driving, managing gears and electronics, and performing regular maintenance, you can drive more economically no matter where you\u2019re going.\n\n## Avoid aggressive drive\n\n1. Brake in a controlled manner. Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you\u2019ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don\u2019t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel.\n2. Accelerate smoothly. Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money.\n3. Minimize distractions. Whether you\u2019re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions. Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It\u2019s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.\n\n\n## Manage gear and electronics\n\n1. Use air conditioning wisely. At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way.\n2. Cut down on electronics. Your car\u2019s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren\u2019t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings.\n3. Use your gears effectively. Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car\u2019s engine. To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration. While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently. Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you\u2019re new to the technique.\n\n\n## Perform routine maintenance\n\n1. Check your tire pressure regularly. Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently.\n2. Use the right specification of engine oil. Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner\u2019s manual.\n3. Get your car serviced regularly. Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.\n\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Pack light. Bringing extra luggage or hauling large items requires more gas to get your car from place to place. Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle.\n2. Map your journey. Getting lost certainly won\u2019t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you\u2019re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient.\n3. Carpool when possible. Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You\u2019ll also save your car from more wear and tear.\n4. Combine errands. Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start \u201ccold\u201d less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally-focused individual, possibly a commuter or car owner, looking for ways to minimize their environmental impact while still maintaining a budget-friendly driving experience.

{"conversations": ["How to become hot?", "Being hot is more than just a look\u2014it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you\u2019ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don\u2019t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today\u2019s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you\u2019re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you\u2019ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don\u2019t forget how much you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you\u2019ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don\u2019t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that\u2019s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don\u2019t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the \u201cperfect\u201d body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts \u2013 instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You\u2019ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There\u2019s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can\u2019t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you\u2019re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they\u2019re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men\u2019s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you\u2019d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate amount of skin. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it\u2019s not surprising when people can\u2019t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it\u2019s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It\u2019s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer\u2019s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body\u2019s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn\u2019t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren\u2019t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It\u2019s easy to start slumping forward when you\u2019re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they\u2019re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It\u2019s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It\u2019s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don\u2019t try so hard. Or at least look like you\u2019re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you\u2019re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It\u2019s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It\u2019s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you\u2019re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone\u2019s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don\u2019t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they\u2019re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an environmental scientist, sustainability consultant, or eco-conscious individual with a keen interest in climate change mitigation strategies.

{"conversations": ["How to prevent your teen from joining a gang?", "Gangs can be a very bad influence on a teen.  Teens often want to join a gang because of certain issues such as racism, poverty, loneliness, and media influences. You can prevent your teen from joining a gang by education about the appeal of gangs for teens, talking and listening to your teen, and getting involved in your own community.\n\n## Educate yourself\n\n1. Learn the appeal of gangs. There are many reasons why a teen might join a gang. Learning the potential draw of gangs for teens can help you identify if your teen is at risk. Teens might seek out gangs for a feeling of belonging. If your teen feels like an outsider for any reason, he or she may seek out a gang for a sense of community. Peer pressure is also a major factor in teens joining gangs. If your teen has friends who are in a gang or associated with one, your teen may consider joining as well. Teens also don't always realize the danger of gangs. The idea of being part of a gang might be exciting, especially if your teen has been exposed to video games and other media that glorifies gang violence. If your teen has an underlying mental illness, such as a personality disorder, he or she might seek thrills through joining a gang.\n2. Investigate gang activity in your area. Location is a big risk factor when it comes to your teen joining a gang. Be aware of any gang activity in your area so you know what your teen might be exposed to at school or in the community. You can research gang activity in your area by browsing police reports and police data online. Most areas have a police blotter website where you can enter your zip code and see of any recent arrests or disturbances in your area. Talk to officials at your teen's school. Principals and superintendents should be aware if there is any gang activity occurring in their jurisdiction. Make an appointment with an official at the school and ask him or her about gang activity. Many people feel certain locations make them immune to gangs. If you live in the suburbs, for example, you might think your teen is immune to gang violence. However, in a lot of big cities gangs eventually move into the suburbs. In the Chicago suburb Evanston, for example, gang activity has been on the rise in the last few years. Be vigilant about potential gang activity regardless of your location.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the warning signs your teen is involved with a gang. Make sure you know the warnings signs regarding gang activity in teens. You should be concerned if your teen is displaying any of the following signs:\n\t* Wearing a certain color or color scheme suddenly\n\t* An increased interest in gangs, gangster music, and gangster movies\n\t* Bragging about having friends in gangs\n\t* Coming home with expensive items\n\t* Using hand gestures and signs to communicate with friends\n\t* Aggressive or withdrawn behavior\n\n\n## Work with your teen\n\n1. Talk to your teen about gangs. Education is key to keeping your teen from joining a gang. Take time to sit down and talk to your teen about the dangers of gangs. Be as frank as possible when discussing gangs with your teens. Explain that, short term, gang activity can lead to trouble with police, trouble with school, and poor relationships with family members. Longterm, make sure your teen knows gang activity can prevent them having access to education and employment options, time in jail, and a risk to their personal safety and the personal safety of their family and friends. Listen as well. Your teen may be compelled to argue or even disregard what you're saying. Try to understand why your teen is resisting. Is he or she being intimidated by a gang? Is a person your teen looks up to in a gang? Understanding the reasons gang membership is appealing to teens can help you better address the problem.\n2. Keep your teen engaged in other activities. Teens often join gangs for a sense of community or for some excitement. Keeping your teen as engaged in other activities as possible can lessen the draw of gangs. Encourage your teen to engage in activities that appeal to his or her interest. Is your teen always sketching or drawing? Enroll him or her in art classes. Is your teen athletic? Encourage him or her to join a school sports team. Is your teen interested in music? Invest in a piano, guitar, or other musical instrument. Push your teen to find an after school job. While some teens might resist the notion of working, emphasize how building a work ethic can help later on. Talk about what your teen could do with all the extra spending money. Allow your teen to have friends over at your house. You want your teen to feel most comfortable at home, where it's safe. This also gives you an opportunity to get to know your teen and his or her peers. You can encourage wholesome activities, like board games and age appropriate movies, over the kinds of activities that might land your teen in trouble.\n3. Learn how to best communicate with a teen. Communicating with teenager can be difficult. Most teens feel an increased need for autonomy and independence, which means they may pull away and rebel against you. However, learning the means to effectively communicate with a teen can help. Always listen without judgment. If your teen is willing to share something with you, let him or her. Try to stay calm and listen, even if your concerned by what your teen is saying. Remember, as a parent you're better off hearing bad news than not hearing it. Being reactionary and harsh can discourage your teen from reaching out when in need. Respect your teen's sense of privacy and autonomy. Unless you suspect a serious problem, allow your teen his or her own space. Let them have a bedroom to themselves. Do not always ask who your teen is calling or texting on the phone. Do not touch your teen's belonging without permission. Schedule times to talk. You do not need to schedule a weekly conversation, but having a family dinner night or board game night gives your teen the opportunity to share. Strive to keep communication open and keep yourself available when your teen is in need.\n4. Identify positive role models for your teen. Teens often join gangs because they feel lost. Lacking positive role models, a teen might turn to the allure of a gang. Identify positive roll models for your teen. Get your teen involved in the community. Encourage him or her to volunteer. Take him or her to church, town hall meetings, and other places and meetings you attend. Teach your teen about people you admire. This can be someone you know personally, like your great-grandmother who supported her family during the Great Depression. It can also be a public figure, like a politician or activist. Showing your teen what you believe admirable qualities constitute can lessen the appeal of gang members.\n\n\n## Improve your community\n\n1. Remove gang related graffiti. Graffiti is often a way for gangs to advertise and recruit new members. If you notice new or unusual graffiti in your area, google the images to see if they're gang affiliated. If they are, talk to the local police about having them removed as soon as possible. Depending on regulations in your area, you may be able to remove the images yourself or schedule a community cleanup. Stop by the local courthouse and ask what your options are in terms of arranging a cleanup.\n2. Team up with other parents. The phrase \"It takes a village to raise a child\" exists for a reason. You cannot do this alone. Work with other parents to build a stronger community and to keep out gangs. Schedule a meeting with other parents in town to discuss gang activity in your area. Brainstorm ideas about how to keep your teens out of gangs. Working together, you and other parents can create regular community events and activities for teens to engage in in order to discourage them from joining gangs. You can also go, as a group, to a PTA to raise any concerns you have about gang activity in the school system. Look into starting a neighborhood watch to keep on the lookout for gang activity.\n3. Take political action. In order to address gang activity, political action may be necessary. Increasing law enforcement presence in your are and providing community outreach to at-risk teens may be needed in your area. Start letter writing and phone campaigns to local members of Congress. Explain why your area needs help addressing gang violence and gang activity. Demand community outreach in your area. Raise awareness. Buy an ad on the local radio. Hand out pamphlets at community centers, schools, churches, grocery stores, and other areas. A single call to local police about gang activity has little effect. A collective group effort is necessary to stomping out gang activity in your area. Make sure other parents on board with talking to the police together.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned parent or guardian, possibly a single parent, who is deeply worried about their teenager's safety and well-being.

{"conversations": ["Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20\u00b0C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.", "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp.

In most people this is the left hemisphere, which leads to these people being right handed as they use their dominant hand to perform tasks involving fine motor control, such as writing. Left handed people have their language centres in the right hemisphere, and while they may perform other tasks with their left hand they can often do tasks involving fine motor control with either hand.\nThere are also people who are truly ambidextrous, capable of performing tasks with either hand equally well.

{"conversations": ["How to peel plums?", "Peeled plums are perfect for pies, jam, cakes, and baby food. If you try to peel a plum by simply pulling back the skin, you'll end up with a sticky mess on your hands. Instead, blanch the plums and then place them in an ice bath or trim the skin off with a knife. This simple techniques are quick, easy, and will leave you with delicious plum flesh.\n\n## Blanch plums\n\n1. Boil a pot of water on the stovetop. Choose a pot large enough to hold all your plums and fill half of it with water. It'll probably take about 10 minutes to boil..\n\t* Place a lid on the pot to help the water to boil quicker.\n2. Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Add water and ice to the bowl at a 50:50 ratio. This will act as an ice bath for the plums.\n3. Slice an \"x\" on the bottom of each plum. Use a paring knife to cut a cross hatch at the bottom of the plum (the side opposite the stem). Make each cut to be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. This will make it nice and easy to peel back the skin. Don\u2019t worry about making the cut deep, simply cut through the skin of the plum.\n4. Blanch the plums for 45 seconds in boiling water. Carefully place the plums into the pot of water. It is important not to leave the plums in the water for longer than 45 seconds, as the flesh will go mushy and the plums will start to disintegrate. Always be careful when cooking with hot water to avoid burns.\n5. Submerge the plums in the ice water for 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the plums from the boiling water into the ice bath. The icy water will help to pull the skin away from the flesh of the plums. Make sure that all the plums are fully submerged in the water. If some of the plums aren\u2019t submerged in the ice bath, make another ice bath for them.\n6. Peel the skin off the plums. Place your finger under 1 of the little flaps formed by the \"x\" you sliced, and pull back the flap. The skin should easily come loose in 1 big strip. Keep pulling back the flaps on all four sides until you've completely peeled the plum. If there is still a little skin on the plum, use a paring knife to slice off any remaining skin.\n7. Cut around the circumference of the plum. Press the paring knife firmly into the flesh until it hits the stone. Follow the natural seam in the skin and cut right around the plum. Keeping cutting until you have split the plum in half.If you don\u2019t have a paring knife, use a sharp kitchen knife instead.\n8. Twist each half of the plum in opposite directions to pull it away from the stone. Hold 1 half of the plum in each hand. Firmly grip the halves and slowly turn them away from each other until one half of the plum comes loose from the stone.\n9. Lever the stone out with a spoon. Push a dessert spoon under the stone and then press the handle down to pop the stone out. If the stone won\u2019t coming out, push the spoon under the opposite side of the stone and then lever it out.\n\n\n## Use a knife\n\n1. Cut the plum in half and pop the stone out. Place the plum on a chopping board and cut around the circumference of the plum. Use a teaspoon to pop the stone out of the plum.\n2. Chop both pieces of plum in half. Cut each plum half lengthways to create a wedge. This makes the plum easier to peel.If your plum is particularly large, consider chopping each piece of plum into thirds.\n3. Trim the skin off each plum wedge. Press the skin side of the plum firmly down against the chopping board. Carefully glide the knife as close to the skin as possible to remove the skin from the flesh.Compost the plum skin or use it in smoothies.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A sustainability consultant or environmental engineer with a focus on industrial emissions and energy efficiency.

{"conversations": ["How to drive economically?", "Everyone needs to use a car from time to time, but gas can be expensive. Driving more economically can save you money and keep your car\u2019s parts from wearing quickly. By avoiding aggressive driving, managing gears and electronics, and performing regular maintenance, you can drive more economically no matter where you\u2019re going.\n\n## Avoid aggressive drive\n\n1. Brake in a controlled manner. Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you\u2019ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don\u2019t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel.\n2. Accelerate smoothly. Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money.\n3. Minimize distractions. Whether you\u2019re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions. Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It\u2019s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.\n\n\n## Manage gear and electronics\n\n1. Use air conditioning wisely. At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way.\n2. Cut down on electronics. Your car\u2019s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren\u2019t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings.\n3. Use your gears effectively. Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car\u2019s engine. To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration. While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently. Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you\u2019re new to the technique.\n\n\n## Perform routine maintenance\n\n1. Check your tire pressure regularly. Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently.\n2. Use the right specification of engine oil. Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner\u2019s manual.\n3. Get your car serviced regularly. Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.\n\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Pack light. Bringing extra luggage or hauling large items requires more gas to get your car from place to place. Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle.\n2. Map your journey. Getting lost certainly won\u2019t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you\u2019re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient.\n3. Carpool when possible. Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You\u2019ll also save your car from more wear and tear.\n4. Combine errands. Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start \u201ccold\u201d less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "An environmentally-focused individual, possibly a commuter or car owner, looking for ways to minimize their environmental impact while still maintaining a budget-friendly driving experience.

{"conversations": ["How to hook up with an ex girlfriend?", "## Get ready to hook up with your ex-girlfriend\n\n1. Keep it spontaneous. If you want to hook up with your ex without any strings attached and to have as much fun as possible, then you have to start off by being spontaneous. Don't call her or text her, asking what she's been up to. Instead, you should run into her at a club, a party, or just out in the middle of the day, and start charming her and letting her know that you want to hook up. If you call her or start checking in with her, then she may get the wrong impression and think you want something more than just hooking up. Treat it like meeting a new and exciting girl out at a bar and then bring her home.\n2. Let enough time pass. If you want to start hooking up with your ex, you should wait until at least a few weeks, if not a few months, have gone by before you start trying to hook up with your ex again. Even if you had an amicable and mutual break-up and there are no hard feelings, you should let the dust settle before you try to get back in bed with your ex, or things are bound to get complicated. Enough time should pass that you can see your ex as someone hot who you'd like to hook up with, instead of letting all of your old complicated feelings or emotions well up at the sight of her. Enough time should pass so you get rid of any anger or lingering resentment or bitterness.\n3. Let her know you want to hook up. Once enough time has passed and you've run into your ex, you should make it clear that you want to take her home. Don't tell her that she's beautiful and that you've missed her smile; instead, tell her that she looks great in her new dress and that you've missed her body. You don't have to be too subtle since you should already be pretty comfortable with each other -- just make sure she's feeling it, too. Don't give her a puppy-dog love gaze. Look her up and down and let her see that you think she looks hot. Be blunt. Ask her to come over or wait for an invitation to go to her place.\n4. Make your intentions clear. Before you even touch your ex's lips with your own, you should make your intentions and expectations clear. Tell her you want to hook up without any strings attached, that you're not looking to get back into the relationship, and that you just want to have a little fun. Let her know that you only want to see her to hook up, not to do all the date-y stuff that leads to hooking up. Don't be a jerk. It's not cool to lead on your ex, hook up with her again, and then tell her that you're not really looking to reconnect.\n5. Make sure you're on the same page. Keep in mind that, when you're about to hook up with an ex, it's pretty unlikely that you're both on the same page. That is to say, it's almost always the case that one of you is still hurt, still reeling, and still emotionally vulnerable from the break up. It could be the case that she dumped you and you're pretending that you want to hook up when you really just want to get back together, or that she's totally hung up on you while you just want to get her in bed. But if you really are looking for the same things, then it's safe to go for it. Look into her eyes when you talk about your hook-up status. Does she really agree that it's a good idea, or does she clearly think it'll turn into something more? Think about how serious the relationship was in the beginning. If you were only together for a month or two, then you're both much more likely to be okay with just hooking up than you'd be if you dated for a year or two. Make sure you're both okay with also hooking up with other people. If you're not, then why not just get back together?\n\n\n## Hook up with your ex-girlfriend\n\n1. Make sure you only hook up. Though it sounds harsh, if you're going to hook up with an ex, then you should only hook up with her. Be honest about it. Don't make an excuse every time your ex wants to go somewhere public with you. Tell her that you're not looking for anything other than hooking up.\n2. Hook up sparingly. Hooking up with your ex can be fun and exciting, but that doesn't mean you should do it every night, because guess what? That's starting to look like a relationship. If you're basically only hooking up with your ex, then you're not letting yourself meet other girls or have any fun on the side. The more time you spend together, the more likely you both are to be hurt, so keep it fun and spontaneous instead of setting a hook-up date for every night of the week. Keep it fun and spontaneous. If you see her out, then take her home. If not, then don't call her or text her to find out where she is. You're not supposed to care that much, remember?\n3. Don't get too comfortable. It can be tricky to hook up with an ex without feeling too comfortable. No cuddling, no passionate kisses as you leave, and no hanging out around the house in sweatpants eating cold nachos from the night before. All of these signs show that you're too comfortable in the non-relationship and that you're on your way to dating again.\n4. Stay in control. If you want to hook up with your ex without any trouble, then you have to maintain control of the situation at all times. Don't let her set the terms of your hook up, and try to keep things at her place so you remain the master of your own domain. Don't cancel your plans to hang out with your buddies if she wants to hang out; tell her you'll hang out with her if she's free. This doesn't mean you should tell your ex exactly what to do; you should find a time and place that works for both of you, but you shouldn't fall prey to her needs.\n5. Keep your new relationship private. Don't hang out with your ex in front of your friends, go to a party with her because she doesn't want to show up alone, or tell your friends that you've been hooking up with her again. The more people you bring into it, the more complicated things will get, and you should keep it simple -- just between the two of you. If you start going out in public with her and hanging out with her friends, they'll immediately disapprove and tell your ex that she should set the terms for your relationship. If you bring her out in front of your friends, then she'll start to feel like your girlfriend again.\n6. Avoid \"lovey dovey\" stuff when you're hooking up. Maybe when you were dating, you would be tender with your woman, telling her how beautiful she is, how much you love her, and how much you love the little dimples in her cheeks. Well, all of your Romeo-moves have to go out the door at this point, or she'll get the wrong picture. She'll think, \"He said I'm beautiful -- he must still love me,\" or \"He ran his hands through my hair -- it has to mean something.\" By doing this, you'll be leading her on and making her feel like you still want to date her. You can tell her how hot she is and how much you love her body, but stick to the sexy -- not the tender -- compliments if you want it to last.\n\n\n## Know when to stop hook up\n\n1. Stop if one of you starts developing feelings again. Unfortunately, it'll be hard to keep hooking up with your ex without having one of you develop feelings for the other person again. As soon as that happens, you'll have to push the eject button on the non-relationship, or things will only get worse from there. Unless you're still really in love with your ex and are using your hook up moves to win back her heart -- incidentally, a terrible idea -- you should cease and desist the second you or she shows signs of having feelings. If you start getting that achy feeling in your heart and start musing about what a great relationship you had while knowing it can never work, then it's time to leave. If your ex tells you she misses you, sends you sweet (not sexy) texts, or says she wishes you could do some couple-y things together, then it's time to bow out. If you have to end the \"relationship\" for this reason, explain yourself first. You shouldn't be a jerk just because it's over.\n2. Stop if one of you starts liking someone else. If one of you starts developing feelings for someone else, even if you haven't pursued that person, you should end up the hook-up period. Hooking up with your ex is something to do when you both want to get some action and are bored because there are few romantic prospects in your lives. But if one of you does start liking someone else, it's time to stop hooking up so you have room to explore those feelings. If you know your ex has a crush on someone else, you're doing her a disservice by continuing to hook up with her and taking up her time. If you start liking another girl, she won't want anything to do with you if she knows that you're hooking up with an ex-girlfriend.\n3. Stop when you've fallen into a routine. Hooking up with your ex should last a month or two at most before things start to get more serious. Even if you're both trying as hard as you can to keep things casual, if you've fallen into a rhythm, basically feel like you're dating, and know exactly when you'll see each other next, then it's time to stop hooking up. If you know when you'll see your ex next, and you stop feeling a thrill at the prospect of hooking up, then the fun is over. You can't expect the hook up to last more than a month or two without it leading to something more. Be realistic.\n4. Stop if you start fighting like a couple. As soon as you start fighting again, you should end the relationship. If you're not actually dating, then you shouldn't be fighting. It's that simple. If you hear her say, \"Where is this taking us?\" or \"What does all of this mean?\" Then she's already back in relationship mode, and your hook up sessions have gone too far. You shouldn't be fighting about anything one of you is doing wrong, because you should only be hooking up, right? It may be tempting to fight with your ex again if you're used to it, but remember that it won't lead you anywhere except back where you were -- a bad relationship.\n5. Stop if you're no longer having fun. The whole point of hooking up with your ex is so that both of you can enjoy yourselves, get some sexual pleasure, and have fun without any strings attached. If you're not feeling the hook up anymore, if you feel like you're only in it out of obligation, or if you're hooking up with your ex just because you're bored, then it's time to start looking for someone new. You weren't having fun before and that's why the relationship ended. Be honest about ending the hook-up session. Don't just start avoiding or ignoring your ex. Let her know it's time to move on.\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "A concerned family member or caregiver seeking advice on how to communicate effectively with a loved one who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
