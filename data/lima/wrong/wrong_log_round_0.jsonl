{"conversations": ["How to identify ticks?", "While tick bites are not often painful, they can lead to infections or even chronic illnesses like Lyme disease. If you're uncertain whether you're dealing with a tick infestation, check for defining features that distinguish a tick from other bugs. Some bugs that look like ticks are harmless, but ticks must be dealt with immediately to avoid illness or infection. Call an exterminator if you're still not sure for a professional opinion.\n\n## Check for distinctive tick feature\n\n1. Look for a round, ovular shape. Before a tick is engorged with blood, its body is shaped like an oval with 2 major segments. After a tick is engorged, its head will remain small but its body will grow round and plump.\n2. Check for bugs that are between \u20442 to 2 in (1.3 to 5.1 cm) long. How large a tick is when you find it depends on whether it has recently fed on blood. Before it has drunk any blood, a tick will be around the size of a pinhead. Immediately to several hours afterward, a tick will grow to around the size of a lima bean.\n3. Examine its exterior for a protective hard body. In most cases, ticks have a hard exoskeleton. These are called hard or \"authentic\" ticks and are usually what people are talking about when describing ticks. Soft ticks with a flexible exoskeleton exist but are only found in select areas. Soft ticks are found in the western United States and southwestern Canada.\n4. Check for a star-shaped design on its back. Lone star ticks have a white, star-shaped design on their exoskeletons. If a bug does not have this design, it still may be a tick. This pattern is just a defining feature of this tick species.\n5. Examine the bug for black legs. Black-legged ticks, as suggested by their name, have legs that are darker than their bodies. Like a lone star tick's black legs, this is a defining characteristic of black-legged ticks and may not be present on every tick.\n\n\n## Differentiate between tick and other bug\n\n1. Avoid mistaking bugs with wings or antennae for ticks. Ticks do not have wings, nor do they have antennae. If you have found a bug with either, it is not a tick. Research bugs with similar characteristics to ticks but with wings or antennae if your bug in question has these. Poplar weevils, which are commonly mistaken for ticks, have both wings and antennae.\n2. Count the number of legs to distinguish it from insects. Because ticks are a type of arachnid, like spiders and scorpions, they have 8 legs. If your bug has 6, it is an insect and therefore not a tick. If your bug has less than 6 or more than 8 legs, it is neither an insect nor arachnid but is, regardless, not a tick.\n3. Watch for bugs that feed on blood and do not travel in groups. Billbugs are the commonly mistaken for ticks because of their near-identical appearance. The way to distinguish between a tick and a billbug is to watch them. Billbugs swarm in groups, whereas ticks are usually alone. Ticks also feed on blood, whereas billbugs do not. As a general rule, billbugs do not hang around or on people and animals. Ticks often do.\n4. Look for bugs that burrow in the skin instead of resting on its surface. Both ticks and bed bugs hang around animals and humans. Their method of feeding off of people and animals, however, differs. Ticks burrow into the skin to drink a living creature's blood but bed bugs stay on the skin's surface. Make sure you know whether a bug is a tick or bed bug before removing it from your skin. Without proper precautions, you may remove a tick's body while its head remains lodged in your skin.\n\n\n## Identify tick bite\n\n1. Check for mild pain around the bite. Tick bites are not usually painful. If you experience sharp pain, you have not likely been bitten by a tick. Research your other symptoms to determine what insect or arachnid bit you and begin treatment. If a soft tick bites you, you might notice localized pain immediately after the tick drops off.\n2. Inspect the site for redness. Although tick bites are not painful, they can still set off your body's immune system. If the bite and the skin surrounding it looks reddish, it may be a tick bite. Keep in mind, however, that redness is a symptom of many bug bites.\n3. Watch for rash development in the days and weeks following your bite. While not often a symptom of tick bites, you may develop a rash if your tick bite becomes infected or if you contracted an illness from the tick bite. If a rash spreads from your tick bite to other parts of your body, call your doctor or visit an urgent care clinic. Some illnesses that ticks carry, like Lyme disease, can take months or years before symptoms develop.\n4. Look for a tick still attached to your body. Because tick bites usually do not hurt, the most common way to spot a tick bite is to see the tick burrowed in your skin. Compare the bug on your body to other insects before removing it so you can use a pair of tweezers or a credit card to safely get it out of your skin. If you are not careful, tick heads can remain lodged in your skin.\n5. Recognize tick bite symptoms that require immediate medical care. While most tick bites can be treated at home, you may need emergency care if you develop an infection or allergic reaction. Seek emergency medical help immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms:\n\t* Raised red bumps (hives) all over your body\n\t* Trouble breathing\n\t* Swelling of the mouth, lips, tongue, or throat\n\t* Lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness\n"], "source": "wikihow", "questioner": "an individual who is concerned about their health and outdoor activities, such as hikers, campers, or gardeners.

{"conversations": ["I am shocked at the number of questions on open forums that reads like the following,\n\"my advisor has stopped funding me\"\n\"my advisor has been completely ignoring my emails\"\n\"my advisor is stealing my ideas!\"\n\"my advisor wants to be 1st author, when I did the majority of the work!\"\n\"my advisor wants to add another student to the paper and this is unfair!\"\nI was wondering whether these pervasive problems go away, when one is doing mathematics research? I imagine that in math research, one has more control/ownership of their work, there's no lab to be a part of and contribute to, one's funding is typically in the form of teaching stipends, and the meetings are typically one-on-one, with no group meetings to attend.\nIs a math PhD a better experience than a science PhD, in the sense that there is significantly less risk of working for a problematic, unethical, malicious scientist/professor who only cares about himself/herself?", "First, please keep in mind that the number of questions on the public forum doesn't give any indication of how common such issues are, since people usually only post when something is wrong. We don't hear about all the cases where everything is fine. It is unclear why math advisors should inherently be better people than in any other field, and there is no empirical evidence that warrants this. However, a few of the specific issues you mention are perhaps less likely to arise in mathematics, due to cultural and structural reasons.\n\n>\"my advisor has stopped funding me\"\n\nIn the US, at least, the main avenue of funding for math graduate students is through teaching assistantships, since math departments teach a large number of service courses. Faculty who have grants can sometimes offer their students a research assistantship instead, so that the student doesn't have to teach. But a student really isn't completely reliant on their advisor for funding. Moreover, there typically aren't major expenses for the research itself (no expensive equipment, etc), so as long as the student is getting paid, research can continue.\n(This is not necessarily the case in other countries.)\n\n>\"my advisor wants to be 1st author, when I did the majority of the work!\"\n\nThe general practice in mathematics is that all authors are listed alphabetically, and the concept of \"first authorship\" does not exist. As such, people don't bother to keep track of who did the \"majority\" of the work. Thus this particular issue doesn't arise in mathematics.\n\n>\"my advisor is stealing my ideas!\"\n\nWhile individual departments may vary, I think there's a general sense in mathematics that a joint paper \"counts\" about the same as a solo paper. As such, if a student has contributed to a project, the advisor has no particular incentive not to include them as an author on the paper.\n\n>\"my advisor wants to add another student to the paper and this is unfair!\"\n\nAs above, it isn't any particular disadvantageous to a student if another student is added.", "I agree with most of this, except that in mathematics I think a joint paper *published by a student with their thesis advisor* is usually worth distinctly less than a solo paper by the student -- within the standard culture of mathematics, the former indicates an unusual amount of help. In my experience, it is more common for this to be violated *in favor of the student*, so that e.g. certain solo papers arising from student theses were largely told to the student by their eminent advisor. Our community seems bad at recognizing that there are still victims here...just not the student.", "You're right that within the standard culture of mathematics, a joint paper published by a student with their thesis advisor may be perceived as having less value compared to a solo paper by the student. This is due to the implicit understanding that the advisor has provided substantial assistance. It is disheartening to hear that there are cases where this norm is violated, and certain thesis papers shaped by the advisor end up being published as solo student papers. However, calling the advisor a victim might be an exaggeration, as university professors typically have immense leverage over their graduate students."], "source": "multi_turn", "questioner": "A concerned and inquisitive graduate student or researcher in a STEM field, who is currently experiencing difficulties with their advisor and is seeking reassurance and advice about the nature of mathematics research in comparison to other fields.

{"conversations": ["When learning vocabulary, especially with the use of SRS (Spaced Repetition System), it is interesting to use flashcards. A commonly encountered problem is how to formulate those for maximum efficiency.\nHow does learning vocabulary through sentences, thus giving context to the used words, compare to learning to recognize words alone? For example, the context may give away the meaning of the problematic vocabulary. Are there studies or expert opinions on one approach being preferable to the other at different stages of language learning?  Or is it recommended that they be mixed for best results?", "It's usually best to avoid dichotomies like \"Is strategy X better or strategy Y better?\". In most cases, strategies are not mutually exclusive but complementary. \n\nWith vocabulary learning, using just one strategy is probably the least efficient. This is because every strategy has certain strengths (certain skills it builds well) and certain weaknesses (skills it doesn't cover well)- and if you keep using one strategy, you'll be only focusing on the strengths (but with diminishing returns), and not addressing the weaknesses.\n\nUsing flashcards helps you establish word-to-meaning equivalences quickly, but it usually does so with a shallow meaning, ignoring the breadth of meaning that words usually have. It also ignores the contextual subtleties of the word, and the knowledge is not always retained long-term. \n\nIt's best to combine flashcards with other strategies that will help you see how the word is used in context, show you the variety of meanings it can have (and doesn't have), see what collocations the word has, etc. One way of doing this is by reading examples of the word and writing your own sample sentences. Another important thing is to be exposed to the word in natural settings - so it's important to read a lot so that you'll encounter the words you've learnt naturally."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A language learner or educator with a strong interest in effective language acquisition strategies.
