He proves theorems about mod-$p$ modular forms using what are essentially comparison theorems between etale cohomology and de Rham cohomology, and many more examples. The proof of the main theorem ($\\S5$, starting at page 156) is itself a very modern proof which fundamentally uses the viewpoint of $X_0(N)$ as a scheme.\n\nSecond, there are many beautiful ideas which have their original in this paper: it contains many of the first innovative ideas for studying $2$-dimensional (and beyond) Galois representations, including the link between geometric properties (multiplicity one) and arithmetic properties, geometric conceptions for studying congruences between Galois representations, understanding the importance of the finite-flat property of group schemes, and the identification of the Gorenstein property. There is a theoretical $p$-descent on the Eisenstein quotient when previously descents were almost all explicit $2$-descents with specific equations. It introduces the winding quotient, and so on.\n\nThird, while it is a dense paper, it is dense in the best possible way: many of the small diversions could have made interesting papers on their own. Indeed, even close readers of the paper today can find connections between Mazur's asides and cutting edge mathematics. When Mazur raises a question in the text, it is almost invariably very interesting. One particular (great) habit that Mazur has is thinking about various isomorphisms and by pinning down various canonical choices identifies refined invariants. To take a random example, consider his exploration of the Shimura subgroup at the end of section 11. He finishes with a question which to a casual reader may as well be a throw-away remark. But this question was first solved by Merel, and more recently generalized in some very nice work of Emmanuel Lecouturier. Lecouturier's ideas then played an important role in the work of Michael Harris and Akshay Venkatesh. Again, one could give many more such examples of this. Very few papers have the richness of footnotes and asides that this paper does. Never forget that one of the hardest things in mathematics is coming up with interesting questions and observations, and this paper contains many great ones - it is bursting with the ideas of a truly creative mathematician.\n\nFinally, the result itself is amazing, and (pretty much) remains the only method available for proving the main theorem (the second proof due to Mazur is very related to this one). To give a sense of how great the theorem is, note that if $E$ is a semistable elliptic curve, then either $E$ is isogenous to a curve with a $p$-torsion point, or $E[p]$ is absolutely irreducible. This result (added for clarity: explicitly, Mazur's Theorem that $E/\\mathbf{Q}$ doesn't have a $p$-torsion point for $p > 7$) is crucially used in Wiles' proof of Fermat. One could certainly argue that without this paper (and how it transformed algebraic number theory) we would not have had Wiles' proof of Fermat, but it's even literally true that Mazur's theorem was (and remains so today, over 40 years later) an essential step in any proof of Fermat."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "a mathematician or a mathematics student with a strong interest in number theory.

That means that it runs a piece of Javascript until it returns control back to the interpreter.  Then, only when it returns back to the interpreter, Javascript gets the next event from the event queue and runs it.\nAll things like timers and network events run through the event queue.  So, when a timer fires or a network request arrives, it does not ever \"interrupt\" the currently running Javascript.  Instead, an event gets put in the Javascript event queue and then, when the currently running Javascript finishes, the next event is pulled from the event queue and it gets its turn to run.\nSo, when you do an infinite loop such as ```while(flag==false) {}```, the currently running Javascript never finishes and thus the next event is never pulled from the event queue and thus the value of ```flag``` never gets changed.  They key here is that Javascript is not interrupt driven.  When a timer fires, it does not interrupt the currently running Javascript, run some other Javascript and then let the currently running Javascript continue.  It just gets put in the event queue waiting until the currently running Javascript is done to get its turn to run.\n\nWhat you need to do is rethink how your code works and find a different way to trigger whatever code you want to run when the ```flag``` value changes.  Javascript is designed as an event-driven language.  So, what you need to do is figure out what events you can register an interest in so you can either listen for the event that might cause the flag to change and you can examine the flag on that event or you can trigger your own event from whatever code might change the flag or you can implement a callback function that whatever code changes that flag can call your callback whenever the piece of code responsible for changing the flag value would change it's value to ```true```, it just calls the callback function and thus your code that wants to run when the flag gets set to ```true``` will get to run at the right time.  This is much, much more efficient than trying to use some sort of timer to constantly check the flag value.\n```function codeThatMightChangeFlag(callback) {\n    // do a bunch of stuff\n    if (condition happens to change flag value) {\n        // call the callback to notify other code\n        callback();\n    }\n}\n```"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "a JavaScript developer or programmer who is facing a specific issue with a stuck JavaScript function.

But when I try this with a Raspberry Pi system image (e.g. raspbian), I get:\n```mount: unknown filesystem type '(null)'\n```\nAnd no matter what I try with ```-t```, it won't work.  How can I mount this image?", "You can't mount the image as a whole because it actually contains two partitions and a boot sector.  However, you can mount the individual partitions in the image if you know their offset inside the file.  To find them, examine the image as a block device with ```fdisk -l whatever.img```.  The output should include a table like this:\n```Device         Boot     Start       End  Blocks  Id System\nwhatever.img1            8192    122879   57344   c W95 FAT32 (LBA)\nwhatever.img2          122880   5785599 2831360  83 Linux\n```\nThese are the two partitions.  The first one is labelled \"FAT32\", and the other one \"Linux\". Above this table, there's some other information about the device as a whole, including:\n```Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\n```\nWe can find the offset in bytes by multiplying this unit size by the ```Start``` block of the partition:\n\n* 1st partition 512 * 8192 = 4194304\n* 2nd partition 512 * 122880 = 62914560\n\nThese can be used with the ```offset``` option of the ```mount``` command.  We also have a clue about the type of each partition from ```fdisk```.  So, presuming we have directories ```/mnt/img/one``` and ```/mnt/img/two``` available as mount points:\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304 -t vfat whatever.img /mnt/img/one\nmount -v -o offset=62914560 -t ext4 whatever.img /mnt/img/two\n```\nIf you get an \"overlapping loop\" error here, your version of ```mount``` requires you to specify the size as well as the offset of the first partition.  Unmount that, and use the number of blocks (57344) * 512 (= 29360128):\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304,sizelimit=29360128 \\\n    -t vfat whatever.img /mnt/img/one\n```\nThe second partition doesn't need a sizelimit since there's nothing after it in the image.    \nYou can now access the two partitions.  If you do not intend to change anything in them, use the ```-r``` (read-only) switch too.  If you do change anything, those changes will be included in the ```.img``` file.\nNote that the first partition is probably mounted on ```/boot``` in the second partition when the system is running."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A tech-savvy user or system administrator who is experienced in Linux-based operating systems, particularly Raspberry Pi.

If a ```car``` is ```electric_car```, it can no longer appear in ```gas_car``` or a ```hybrid_car```, etc. \nIs it a bad practice to have several mutually exclusive one-to-one relationships in database design?", "The different types of cars are an instance of a general problem that surfaces over and over again in data modeling.  It is called \"generalization/specialization\" in ER modeling, and \"superclass/subclass\" in object modeling.  \nAn object modeler uses the inheritance features built into the object model to solve the problem quite easily.  The subclasses simply extend the superclass.\nThe relational modeler is faced with a problem.  how to design the tables so as to emulate the benefits that one would get from inheritance?  \nThe simplest technique is called single table inheritance.  Data about all types of cars are grouped into a single table for cars.  There is a column, car_type, that groups together all the cars of a single type.  No car can belong to more than one type.  If a column is irrelevant to, say, electric cars,  it will be left NULL in the rows that pertain to electric cars.\nThis simple solution works well for the smaller and simpler cases.  The presence of a lot of NULLs adds a tiny bit to storage overhead, and a little bit to retrieval overhead.  The developer may have to learn SQL three-valued logic if boolean tests are done on nullable columns.  This can be baffling at first, but one gets used to it.\nThere is another technique, called class table inheritance.  In this design, there are separate tables for gas_car, electric_car, and hybrid_car, in addition to a combined table, car, for all of them.  When you want all of the data about a specific kind of car, you join the car table with the appropriate specialized table.  There are fewer NULLs in this design, but you do more joining.  This technique works better in the larger and more complex cases.\nThere is a third technique called shared primary key.  This technique is often used in conjunction with class table inheritance.  The specialized tables for the subclasses have, as their primary key, a copy of the primary key of the corresponding entry in the car table.  This id column can  be declared to be both the primary key and a foreign key.\nThis involves a little extra programming when new cars are to be added, but it makes the joins simple, easy, and fast.\nSuperclasses and subclasses happen all the time in the real world.

{"conversations": ["I read somewhere that C\u266f and D\u266d actually differ 41 by cents from each other. As far as I know, there should be 2 semitones between C and D. Moreover, C\u266f is one semitone above C and D\u266d is one semitone below D. Therefore, C\u266f and D\u266d should be equivalent. If so, how can C\u266f and D\u266d actually differ by 41 cents from each other?", "When we talk about the exact frequencies of each pitch class, we have to know the temperament, and a reference pitch. For example, 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) with A4=440Hz is a standard in modern music. From those two parameters, we can extrapolate the exact frequency of every possible note.\n\n12TET is nearly ubiquitous nowadays (at least in Western music), but it doesn't sound as clean as Just Intonation (JI). In essence, 12TET has made every key sound equally imperfect. JI creates a scale where the intervals in the primary chords are all very nice simple ratios, and so the chords ring out very cleanly, but it only works in that key. Important note: within a given JI tuning, each of the 12 pitch classes still has only one single frequency. There is no difference between C\u266f and D\u266d in, say, \"Pythagorean tuning based on A, with A=440Hz\".\n\nBut most music doesn't stay in one key. While a piano can't make pitch adjustments on the fly (which is why we've agreed to use 12TET for it), most instruments in an orchestra can. So when the piece is in A major, the orchestra will use JI and adjust C\u266f to be a little flatter than it would be if using 12TET. But then if the piece modulates to F\u266f minor, they'll start playing it slightly sharp.\n\nWhen people say that C\u266f is not the same as D\u266d, what they really mean (whether they realize it or not) is that context may make for different micro-adjustments. In C major, a C\u266f might be the third of an A major chord, perhaps a secondary dominant of the ii chord, while D\u266d might be the root of the Neapolitan chord.

Read their review, filter their non-technical rants, keep whatever helpful criticism you can extract from their comments, and address them nicely and respectfully. It may actually be that the techniques you used were adequate but you failed to point out why and how it would be unnecessary to use more expensive methods. Always assume that they are right. If they are mistaken, respectfully point out in your response why you are right and edit the original manuscript to make the issue clearer to future readers.\n\nFor instance, if the reviewer wrote:\n\n> The methods used in the paper are abysmal. The authors use an outdated and archaic method, which is also very uncertain, to measure the mass of the frogs, which is by weighting them on a scale. The atomic mass interferometer, which uses gravitational waves and is able to precisely infer mass with an uncertainty of one atomic mass unit per kilogram, is the state of the art in weighting.\n\nYou can write as a response:\n\n* The reviewer is absolutely correct that atomic mass interferometry (AMI) is the state of the art in weighting. However, we opted to use analytical scales to measure the mass of the frogs because the mass variations that we expected to measure are of at least 1 g, a quantity signficantly higher than the uncertainty of even the most rudimentary analytical scales. We do, however, agree, that the quantum mechanical analysis of the molecular buildup in neural entangled channels in during frog electrophoresis, which is suggested as an interesting prospective investigation, will benefit from the low uncertainty provided by AMI. In order to make it clear that the methods used in our study were adequate, we have modified the original manuscript to include the following sentence in the second paragraph of page 5: While there are more precise methods to infer mass, such as atomic mass interferometry, analytical scales offer accuracies that are compatible with the 1 g mass variations that were found in this study (see Table 3, for instance).", "Do reviewers that make those kinds of comments tend to accept papers after these kinds of revisions?", "Reviewers don't accept papers, editors do.

For example, people see that something is self-moving and they call it AI, even if it's on autopilot (like cars or planes) or there is some simple algorithm behind it.\nWhat are the minimum general requirements so that we can say something is AI?", "It's true that the term has become a buzzword, and is now widely used to a point of confusion - however if you look at the definition provided by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, they write it as follows:\n\n> We define AI as the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions. Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time planners, and decision-theoretic systems. We explain the role of learning as extending the reach of the designer into unknown environments, and we show how that role constrains agent design, favoring explicit knowledge representation and reasoning.\n\nArtificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach - Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig\n\nSo the example you cite, \"autopilot for cars/planes\", is actually a (famous) form of AI as it has to use a form of knowledge representation to deal with unknown environments and circumstances. Ultimately, these systems also collect data so that the knowledge representation can be updated to deal with the new inputs that they have found. They do this with autopilot for cars all the time\n\nTo answer your question, for something to be considered as \"having AI\", it needs to be able to deal with unknown environments/circumstances in order to achieve its objective/goal, and render knowledge in a manner that provides for new learning/information to be added easily. There are many different types of well defined knowledge representation methods, ranging from the popular neural net, through to probabilistic models like bayesian networks (belief networks) - but fundamentally actions by the system must be derived from whichever representation of knowledge you choose for it to be considered as AI."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A computer scientist, researcher, or AI enthusiast with a strong interest in understanding the true nature of AI.

More precisely, every $2$-clause $l_1 \\lor l_2$ can be understood as a pair of implications: $\\lnot l_1 \\Rightarrow l_2$ and $\\lnot l_2 \\Rightarrow l_1$. If you set $a$ to true, $b$ must be true as well. If you set $b$ to false, $a$ must be false as well. Such implications are straightforward: there is no choice, you have only $1$ possibility, there is no room for case-multiplication. You can just follow every possible implication chain, and see if you ever derive both $\\lnot l$ from $l$ and $l$ from $\\lnot l$: if you do for some $l$, then the 2-SAT formula is unsatisfiable, otherwise it is satisfiable. It is the case that the number of possible implication chains is polynomially bounded in the size of the input formula.\nWith $3$-SAT, you can express implications of the form $a \\Rightarrow b \\lor c$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are literals.

The main objection was to the boardgame we were publishing, The Battle of Five Armies. The author of that game had given us a letter from his attorney claiming the work was grandfathered because it was published after the copyrights for JRRT's works had lapsed and before any renewals were made. The action also demanded we remove balrog, dragon, dwarf, elf, ent, goblin, hobbit, orc, and warg from the D&D game. Although only balrog and warg were unique names we agreed to hobbit as well, kept the rest, of course. The boardgame was dumped, and thus the suit was settled out of court at that.\n\nHalflings were originally called &quot;hobbits&quot; in the Dungeons & Dragons box set first released in 1974. Later printings changed this to &quot;halfling&quot;.\nAccording to The Acaeum, this change occurred between the fifth printing (Dec 1975 - Apr 1976) and sixth printing (1977), with the six printing being marked the Original Collector's Edition. However, Tim Kask has said that box sets were generally thrown together with whichever printings of the books were on hand, so the distinctions between printings are inexact. The Acaeum notes at least one box set shipped having the revised booklets but no Original Collector's Edition mark.\nDue to an oversight, a single reference to &quot;hobbit&quot; remained on page 6 of Men & Magic, which was fixed in the 2013 Deluxe reprint and PDF copies.\nAccording to Wikipedia, J.R.R. Tolkien sold the film, stage, and merchandising rights to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968, who sold them in turn to Saul Zaentz in 1976.

{"conversations": ["I am a professor of computer science. Help me write an academic research proposal to fund my NLP lab. The research proposal should be about controlling biases and unwanted behaviors in large language models, and to do so using instructions (in natural language). Let's start by drafting an abstract and an introduction.", "Here is the abstract and introduction of a research proposal about controlling biases and unwanted behaviors in large language models:\n\n\n#Controlling Biases in Large Language Models\n\n\n##Abstract\n\nWhile large language models are unlocking previously unimaginable applications, their extensive usage also exacerbates the risk of generating toxic text that amplifies adverse biases in the training data. We propose utilizing the newfound instruction understanding abilities of large language models to identify, explain, and mitigate undesirable biases in text. Our research plan begins with a novel method for eliciting natural language explanations of why a particular text is harmful, without any training data or definition of what constitutes toxic text. We then propose to investigate whether explicitly instructing models to avoid biases using natural language prompts can steer them away from unwanted outputs. Finally, we aim to explore a more permanent solution by fine-tuning the model on anti-harm instructions (behavioral guidelines, codes of conduct, diversity training), and thus informing it on which utterances should be avoided. Successfully tuning large language models to better align with acceptable behavior will dramatically advance the ability to deploy safer, fairer models in real-world settings.\n\n\n##Introduction\n\nLanguage models, the cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP), are known to reflect and even amplify biases in training corpora, often resulting in racist, sexist, and generally toxic outputs. Susceptibility to such harmful biases hinders the deployment of these models and limits their applicability.\n\nA common approach for developing safer models is to try to control the training corpora. [Citations], for example, used a list of banned words to filter potentially harmful text from the C4 corpus. This simple approach fails to remove all adverse biases from the text, as toxic content can be written using words that are, by themselves, benign. Another technique for corpus intervention is data augmentation [Citations], which adds a counterfactual example for each utterance of a potentially biased text. This technique, however, only applies when counterfactual swaps are possible, e.g. gender, and it requires prior knowledge of all potential biases in the training corpus. Data augmentation enlarges an already oversized corpus, and can often create artificial and even unrealistic texts if not done carefully. Finally, various approaches perform post-training debiasing [Citations], but these often result in significant performance degradation on downstream tasks.\n\nWe propose explaining and mitigating adverse biases via natural language instructions. Our plan includes three parts:\n*  Inducing natural language explanations of adverse biases in a given text. We intend to build on our recent work on instruction induction [Citations], and prompt language models to describe \u201cin their own words\u201d whether a given text is problematic and why.\n*  Controlling the manifestation of model biases during generation by prompting language models with explicit instructions. We plan to investigate the use of both model-generated explanations and existing guidelines written for humans (e.g. code of conduct) to reduce and control adverse biases during inference.\n*  Mitigating adverse biases in the model itself by fine-tuning on behavioral guidelines. The goal is to efficiently adapt the model itself so that it (permanently) generates less harmful content. We build on recent work which shows that fine-tuning on task instructions (instruction tuning) improves the zero-shot learning abilities of language models [Citations]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has utilized this framework for teaching models what behaviors should be avoided. The success of instruction tuning suggests that our approach is viable, and we hope it can accelerate the progress towards safer, fairer models."], "source": "authors", "questioner": "A computer science professor with a focus on natural language processing (NLP) and an interest in addressing biases and unwanted behaviors in large language models.

{"conversations": ["What are Null Pointer Exceptions (```java.lang.NullPointerException```) and what causes them?\n\nWhat methods/tools can be used to determine the cause so that you stop the exception from causing the program to terminate prematurely?", "There are two overarching types of variables in Java:\n\n1. Primitives: variables that contain data. If you want to manipulate the data in a primitive variable you can manipulate that variable directly. By convention primitive types start with a lowercase letter. For example variables of type `int` or `char` are primitives.\n\n2. References: variables that contain the memory address of an `Object` i.e. variables that refer to an `Object`. If you want to manipulate the `Object` that a reference variable refers to you must dereference it. Dereferencing usually entails using `.` to access a method or field, or using `[` to index an array. By convention reference types are usually denoted with a type that starts in uppercase. For example variables of type `Object` are references.\n\nConsider the following code where you declare a variable of primitive type `int` and don't initialize it:\n```\nint x;\nint y = x + x;\n```\nThese two lines will crash the program because no value is specified for `x` and we are trying to use `x`'s value to specify `y`. All primitives have to be initialized to a usable value before they are manipulated.\n\nNow here is where things get interesting. Reference variables can be set to `null` which means \"I am referencing nothing\". You can get a `null` value in a reference variable if you explicitly set it that way, or a reference variable is uninitialized and the compiler does not catch it (Java will automatically set the variable to `null`).\n\nIf a reference variable is set to null either explicitly by you or through Java automatically, and you attempt to dereference it you get a `NullPointerException`.\n\nThe `NullPointerException` (NPE) typically occurs when you declare a variable but did not create an object and assign it to the variable before trying to use the contents of the variable. So you have a reference to something that does not actually exist.\n\nTake the following code:\n```\nInteger num;\nnum = new Integer(10);\n```\nThe first line declares a variable named `num`, but it does not actually contain a reference value yet. Since you have not yet said what to point to, Java sets it to `null`.\n\nIn the second line, the `new` keyword is used to instantiate (or create) an object of type `Integer`, and the `reference` variable `num` is assigned to that `Integer` object.\n\nIf you attempt to dereference `num` before creating the object you get a `NullPointerException`. In the most trivial cases, the compiler will catch the problem and let you know that \"`num may not have been initialized`,\" but sometimes you may write code that does not directly create the object.\n\nFor instance, you may have a method as follows:\n```\npublic void doSomething(SomeObject obj) {\n   // Do something to obj, assumes obj is not null\n   obj.myMethod();\n}\n```\nIn which case, you are not creating the object `obj`, but rather assuming that it was created before the `doSomething()` method was called. Note, it is possible to call the method like this:\n```\ndoSomething(null);\n```\nIn which case, `obj` is `null`, and the statement `obj.myMethod()` will throw a `NullPointerException`.\n\nIf the method is intended to do something to the passed-in object as the above method does, it is appropriate to throw the `NullPointerException` because it's a programmer error and the programmer will need that information for debugging purposes.\n\nIn addition to `NullPointerException`'s thrown as a result of the method's logic, you can also check the method arguments for `null` values and throw NPEs explicitly by adding something like the following near the beginning of a method:\n```\n// Throws an NPE with a custom error message if obj is null\nObjects.requireNonNull(obj, \"obj must not be null\");\n```\n\nNote that it's helpful to say in your error message clearly which object cannot be `null`. The advantage of validating this is that 1) you can return your own clearer error messages and 2) for the rest of the method you know that unless `obj` is reassigned, it is not null and can be dereferenced safely.\n\nAlternatively, there may be cases where the purpose of the method is not solely to operate on the passed in object, and therefore a null parameter may be acceptable. In this case, you would need to check for a null parameter and behave differently. You should also explain this in the documentation. For example, `doSomething()` could be written as:\n```\n/**\n  * @param obj An optional foo for ____. May be null, in which case\n  *  the result will be ____.\n  */\npublic void doSomething(SomeObject obj) {\n    if(obj == null) {\n       // Do something\n    } else {\n       // Do something else\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, how to pinpoint the exception & cause using Stack Trace:\n\n> What methods/tools can be used to determine the cause so that you stop the exception from causing the program to terminate prematurely?\n\nSonar with find bugs can detect NPE. Can sonar catch null pointer exceptions caused by JVM Dynamically\n\nNow Java 14 has added a new language feature to show the root cause of NullPointerException. This language feature has been part of SAP commercial JVM since 2006.

Others have done it, e.g. Brian Dickerson: The perils of repeating political nonsense and came to the conclusion that the claim was wrong.\n\nYou just need the chance a random person from a large group has a genius level IQ, then multiply it with the number of people in China and compare the result with the number of people in the USA. The IQ follows a Gaussian distribution where 100 is the mean by definition and a standard deviation (SD) of 15 (after Wechsler) or 16 (after Stanford-Binet). The rarity of a particular IQ can be calculated easily and are listed by the IQ Comparison Site. These numbers give the percentage of people with an IQ equal or lower than the given IQ and the rarity of this occurring.\n\nThe main question actually is what an genius level IQ is. There is no definite answer. According to the IQ Comparison Site, it is 140 or higher (\"Genius or near genius\") while another source states it as at least 160.\nThe rarity of such an IQ is 1/261 (with a SD of 15) or 1/161 (SD=16) for an IQ of 140 and 1/31,560 (SD=15) or 1/11,307 (SD=16) for an IQ of 160 according to Wikipedia. \n\nThe population of USA for 2012 is about 313,221,000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The population of China for 2011 is about 1,370,537,000.\nTaking the lowest rarity of 1/161 from above then there are about 1,370,537,000/161 =  about 8,513,000 geniuses in China, which is significantly less then the 313,221,000 Americans.\nIf you take the 15 SD value of 1/261 then you get only about 5,251,000 Chinese geniuses.\nWith the 160 IQ points, which are more realistic to indicate a real genius, the numbers are even smaller (about 43,400 or 12,100). Note that 1,370,537,000/313,221,000 = 4.375, so in order for this claim to be true actually one of every four (or say five) Chinese would need to be a Genius. Even without the numbers above, it can be easily understood that this is not the case.\nConclusion: This claim is wrong according to the definition and probabilities of the IQ.\n\nSupplement:\nIt has been pointed out, that there are published research results showing that China and other Asian countries have a higher average IQ of about 106 (or even as high as 115) as the normed average of 100. This would increase the number of geniuses in China: The above factor of 1/161 would drop to about 1/60 or, for a Chinese average of 115, even to about 1/17. These numbers can be easily calculated using the standard deviation, e.g. using MS Excel's function ```NORM.DIST(140, 106, 16, TRUE)```.

{"conversations": ["Assume that I am a programmer and I have an NP-complete problem that I need to solve it. What methods are available to deal with NPC problems? Is there a survey or something similar on this topic?", "There are a number of well-studied strategies; which is best in your application depends on circumstance.\n\n* Improve worst case runtime\nUsing problem-specific insight, you can often improve the naive algorithm. For instance, there are $O(c^n)$ algorithms for Vertex Cover with $c huge improvement over the naive $\\Omega(2^n)$ and might make instance sizes relevant for you tractable.\n\n* Improve expected runtime\nUsing heuristics, you can often devise algorithms that are fast on many instances. If those include most that you meet in practice, you are golden. Examples are SAT for which quite involved solvers exist, and the Simplex algorithm (which solves a polynomial problem, but still). One basic technique that is often helpful is branch and bound.\n\n* Restrict the problem\nIf you can make more assumptions on your inputs, the problem may become easy.\n\n* Structural properties\nYour inputs may have properties that simplify solving the problem, e.g. planarity, bipartiteness or missing a minor for graphs. See here for some examples of graph classes for which CLIQUE is easy.  \n\n* Bounding functions of the input\nAnother thing to look at is parameterised complexity; some problems are solvable in time $O(2^kn^m)$ for $k$ some instance parameter (maximum node degree, maximum edge weight, ...) and $m$ constant. If you can bound $k$ by a polylogarithmic function in $n$ in your setting, you get polynomial algorithms. Saeed Amiri gives details in his answer.\n\n* Bounding input quantities\nFurthermore, some problems admit algorithms that run in pseudo-polynomial time, that is their runtime is bounded by a polynomial function in a number that is part of the input; the naive primality check is an example. This means that if the quantities encoded in your instances have reasonable size, you might have simple algorithms that behave well for you.\n\n* Weaken the result\nThis means that you tolerate errorneous or incomplete results. There are two main flavors:\n\n* Probabilistic algorithms\nYou only get the correct result with some probability. There are some variants, most notable Monte-Carlo and Las-Vegas algorithms. A famous example is the Miller-Rabin primality test.\n\n* Approximation algorithms\nYou no longer look for optimal solutions but almost optimal ones. Some algorithms admit relative (\"no worse than double the optimum\"), others absolute (\"no worse than $5$ plus the optimum\") bounds on the error. For many problems it is open how well they can be approximated. There are some that can be approximated arbitrarily well in polynomial time, while others are known to not allow that; check the theory of polynomial-time approximation schemes.\n\nRefer to Algorithmics for Hard Problems by Hromkovi\u010d for a thorough treatment.\n* Simplicity is beauty: Improved upper bounds for vertex cover by Chen Jianer, Iyad A.

Layoffs have a very real impact on both the individuals that are let go and those that remain. I'm sorry you're experiencing this.\nHere are some things to consider that may help you and your colleagues cope with the added stress and emotions following a layoff:\n\n* Acknowledge the layoff and the feelings of your colleagues. Avoiding the topic can extend negative feelings and disenfranchise those most impacted. You should find an opportunity to connect with your colleagues for an honest conversation about your feelings following the layoff.  Perhaps reach out to hold a number of 1-on-1 conversations, or gather your team for an off-site lunch and prompt the discussion.\n* Acknowledge that everyone will be impacted differently. Some of your colleagues will feel totally okay and ready to get back to work.  Others will feel anxious and worried in a way that prevents them from performing the same way they did before the layoff.  There is no right or \"professional\" reaction to a layoff.  Be open to the feelings and reactions of all of your colleagues equally.\n* Create practical solutions to new processes and responsibilities. If your team now has a greater workload, be a generator of solutions.  Try out ideas for making processes in your team more efficient and predictable.\n* Create transparency about the state of the business and potential future staff changes. Layoffs are a clear indication of business trouble.  Facilitate sharing facts about the state of the business and actively work to eliminate rumors.  Additionally, layoffs will likely cause shifts in responsibility as roles are consolidated or reorganized.  Make clear who has specific responsibilities both inside and outside of your team.  Actively eliminate any sources of uncertainty and anxiety that you can.\n* Be a role model. Don't participate in gossip or complaining about the layoff.  Don't disparage management or other colleagues in casual conversation.  Be a model for professionalism and caring.\n* Maintain work standards and a caring meritocracy. A layoff isn't an excuse for allowing work quality to decline.  Additionally, differences in productivity and quality between team members should be consistently and fairly addressed.  If a team member is underperforming following the layoff, provide direct feedback and ask what you can do to help.\n"], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "An employee in a leadership position who has been affected by recent layoffs.

They often will grant the waiver if it's the first time, the absence is not too much over a year, and/or there is a good reason for not returning earlier (e.g. COVID-19).

There, she will be able to present her case to the immigration judge, and if the immigration judge determines that she has not abandoned residence, the immigration judge can grant the waiver for her failure to meet the documentary requirements (think of it as a second opinion on the immigration officer's decision).\n\nThe other option to all this is that she can apply for an SB1 returning resident visa at a US consulate (which will meet the documentary requirements since it is an immigrant visa).

{"conversations": ["I have noticed that some games quote the requirement for \"pixel shader 3.0 or better\". \nWhat is a pixel shader and is it some software requirements or hardware requirements?", "Simple answer\nPixel shaders are tiny programs that can do operations on a single pixel on the screen, as opposed to geometry shaders and vertex shaders which work on the geometrical primitives (triangles) that make up everything you see on the screen. The most common use for pixel shaders is 'shading', approximation to real world lighting. Commonly used shading model is Phong.\nPixel shaders are executed on your video card, so your video card needs to support them. Each new version provides more capabilities, so an older video card will not run newer shaders. A new version of the pixel shader specification (e.g. Pixel Shader 3.0) is usually released for each new version of DirectX (more accurately, Direct3D).\nSoftware Requirements\nYou need to have the correct version of Direct3D (or OpenGL) installed in order to use the shaders. For example, Pixel Shader 4.0 requires at least Direct3D 10. Normally you don't have to worry about this, every game that uses Direct3D will install the correct version for you when you install the game. The only exceptions are Direct3D 10 and later, which will not run on Windows XP or earlier. You will need at least Windows Vista in order to play a game that uses Direct3D 10 or 11.\nWikipedia provides a nice list of Pixel Shader versions, the version of Direct3D you need, and the types of graphics cards that work with them.\n\nTechnical answer\nThe 'standard' stages of a 3D rendering pipeline are as follows (somewhat simplified):\n\n* Transformation (Moving, rotating and scaling all the objects in the scene)\n* Lighting\n* Projection ('Squashing' the 3D world into a 2D plane)\n* Clipping (Removing anything outside the field of view)\n* Rasterising (Converting the vector graphics (triangles, etc) into raster graphics (pixels))\n* Texturing\n* Display\n\nPixel Shaders are used as an alternative to the standard texturing phase. During rasterisation, each triangle is converted into pixels. These pixels do not have their final colour yet, but the do have a bunch of parameters associated with them. These include base colour, texture coordinates, lighting information, etc. The Pixel Shader is a small program that takes these parameters and uses them to calculate the final colour as it is displayed on the screen. The Pixel Shader has access to all texture data, and can use them to do interesting things such as blending two textures (to create a 'dirty' look), using a texture as a bump map (to simulate a relief), or to simulate reflections.\nHardware\nOn the hardware side, Pixel Shaders are executed on 'Shader Units', small processors on your GPU. Each Shader Unit is basically a very simple CPU, but a modern video card may contain thousands of these things (an AMD Radeon HD6990 contains over 3000). Older GPUs had different Shader Units for different tasks: Pixel Shaders were executed on different parts of the system than Vertex Shaders. Modern GPUs have so called 'unified shader units' which can perform all of these operations."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A gamer with a curious mind and an interest in understanding the technical aspects of their gaming experience.

Which is it really?", "strong/weak can be thought of in relation to how the compiler, if applicable, handles typing.\n\n* Weakly typed means the compiler, if applicable, doesn't enforce correct typing.  Without implicit compiler interjection, the instruction will error during run-time.\n```\"12345\" * 1 === 12345  // string * number => number\n```\nStrongly typed means there is a compiler, and it wants you an explicit cast from string to integer.\n```(int) \"12345\" * 1 === 12345\n```\nIn either case, some compiler's features can implicitly alter the instruction during compile-time to do conversions for you, if it can determine that is the right thing to do.\nThus far, JavaScript can be categorized as Not-Strongly-Typed.  That either means it's weakly-typed or un-typed.\n\ndynamic/static can be thought of in relation to how the language instructions manipulate types.\n\n* Dynamically typed means the value's type is enforced, but the variable simply represents any value of any type.\n```x = 12345;    // number\nx = \"string\"; // string\nx = { key: \"value\" }; // object\ny = 123 + x; // error or implicit conversion must take place.\n```\nStatically typed means the variable type is strongly enforced, and the value type is less-so enforced.\n```int x = 12345; // binds x to the type int\nx = \"string\";  // too late, x is an integer - error\nstring y = 123; // error or implicit conversion must take place.\n```\nThus far, JavaScript can be categorized as Not-Statically-Typed.  Also, it appears to be Dynamically Typed, if typed at all.  So we need to see what Typing means.\n\nTyped means that the language distinguishes between different types such as string, number, boolean, object, array, null, undefined and so on. Also each operation is bound to specific types. So you cannot divide an integer by a string.\n```    2 / \"blah\"  // produces NaN\n```\nUntyped means the operation of dividing integer by string would result in treating the first four bytes of string as integer.  This is because Untyped operations take place directly on bits, there are no types to observe.  The outcome will be something quite unexpected:\n```    2 / \"blah\"  // will be treated as  2 / 1500275048\n```\nSince JavaScript behaves according to the definition of being Typed, it must be.  And therefore it must be Dynamically Typed, and Weakly Typed.\nIf anybody claims JavaScript is Untyped, it is merely for academic theory, not for practical application."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A software developer, programmer, or computer science student with a strong interest in JavaScript and its intricacies.

That means a country which exports lots of goods wants to devalue their currency while a country which imports lots of goods does not.\nIn 2016, Turkey imported goods worth US $186 billion and exported goods worth US $156 billion. That means they had a trade deficit of 19%.\nHowever, China only imported goods worth US $1.23 trillion and exported goods worth US $2.27 trillion in 2016. That means they had a trade surplus of 84%.\nWhich is why China wants to devalue their currency while Turkey does not.\nDebt management\nAnother reason to devalue one's currency is that it reduces any debts denoted in that currency. If a country has a problem of too much public and private debt, then an easy way to get rid of it is to cause a hyperinflation. \nChina happens to have a debt-to-gdp ratio of 47.6% while Turkey only has one of 28.3%. When you look at the private debt (debt of private citizens and companies in the country), you see the same picture. Private debit in Turkey was 170% of GDP, while China's is rumored to be over 300%.\nWhich is why reducing debt through causing inflation seems more attractive to China than to Turkey.\nForeign investor relations\nSo why don't all countries get rid of their debt by adding a few zeroes to their bank notes? Because inflating your currency is a surefire way to drive away any foreign investors. Nobody will invest money into your country when that money might be worth nothing in a few years. Investors want stable currencies. Again, we observe the same difference in motivation between Turkey and China here.

If the patent owner cannot enforce it for whatever reason (such as a lack of funding), the patent is effectively toothless.\nBut your competitors will likely not know that. They may therefore be dissuaded from infringing simply by the existence of a patent and the assumption that you would sue. Such a chilling effect on competition may be valuable to you.\nIn addition, if there is infringement, you may be able to get a licensing agreement without the need for litigation. This can be a very lucrative business model, and so may justify the cost of patenting.\nAnd if litigation seems likely, there is a nascent field of litigation funding. While your funders will take quite a great deal of the damages, you may at least get something out of the end of it.\nFinally, even if you can't sue, someone else could. You might therefore get quite some value from selling it off at some point. There are a number of tech businesses where most of their value comes from their IP portfolio.\nOn the whole therefore it depends how you see yourself proceeding. If you're unsure, it may pay to err on the side of patenting: once you disclose or use your invention publicly, you're generally barred from patenting it later (but for a short grace period in some countries), whereas it's easy to abandon a patent (or application) later down the track if you wish."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "an inventor or entrepreneur with a groundbreaking idea for an algorithm.

The former has more chance of happening, before the ice even has the time to start melting.\nThe only way to shoot it without shattering it nor melting it, at least using weapons available to us, would be to use compressed air weapons, but it would need to be significantly powered down to prevent the bullet from shattering, so it would probably not be powerful enough to cause damage.\nThe force needed to break through one square inch of ice is roughly 400 pounds on average. The bullet you're trying to fire is probably 9mm, but let's just calculate as though it was about one square inch (although it's actually quite smaller than that): those 400 pounds equal roughly 1800N.\nThe force that comes out of a 9mm gun is approximately 383 ft-lbs, which equals to 520 newtons per metre. That amount is about 52000N per centimetre. One inch is about 2 and a half centimeters, so that means it's more about 20'800N per inch. As you can see, it's a lot more than what it takes to break ice.\nAs for the \"wall\" towards which something has to be pushed in order to break it, the air will fulfill the role: the atmospheric pressure is about 15 pounds per square inch: it doesn't seem like a lot, but in the time it takes the bullet to win this force and gain momentum, it gets shattered by the enormous amount of energy produced by the weapon.", "what makes you think it would shatter?

{"conversations": ["Why isn't Sectumsempra an Unforgivable Curse?", "Not many people knew Sectumsempra - they'd need to know it exists to  ban it.\nSeverus Snape invented Sectumsempra while at Hogwarts, and wrote it down in his Potions book. He doesn't seem to have told many people about it, it's possible he didn't tell anyone at all.\n\n\u201cHarry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned \u2018For Enemies\u2019, that he had marked a few weeks previously.\u201d - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 24 (Sectumsempra)\n\nHis book was hidden away until Harry found it, and Harry didn't tell the rest of the wizarding world about it either. Severus himself was seen using Sectumsempra when the Order was moving seven Harrys, and Harry had used it a few times after he found it in Snape's old book. Lupin knows of it, since he described it as one of Snape's specialties.\nHowever, they are probably some of the only people who know it - it isn't widely known like the three Unforgivable Curses. No one else, either in the Death Eaters or the Order of the Phoenix, is ever said to use it.  It's likely that the Ministry didn't even know of it. Therefore, the Ministry wouldn't have even been able to make the decision to classify it as an Unforgivable Curse, since they would likely not have even known it existed.\nIf the Ministry knew about it, would it be classified as Unforgivable?\nThe reason it wasn't classified as an Unforgivable Curse is because the Ministry wouldn't have known about it - they would be unable to make any decision on something they don't know exists. That, by itself, doesn't say whether the Ministry would classify it as one if they knew about it.\nNot all potentially harmful spells are classified as Unforgivable Curses.\nIt's nowhere near guaranteed, though, that if the Ministry knew about Sectumsempra, that they'd classify it as an Unforgivable Curse. There are other spells that could clearly do harm. Just to give a few examples - Confringo, Flagrante, and the creation of Fiendfyre are all potentially harmful but not Unforgivable.\nIt's never mentioned why those three curses are classified as Unforgivable and others aren't, but it seems likely that it's because there are little to no uses for them that aren't evil. The punishment for using an Unforgivable Curse is a lifetime sentence in Azkaban, so only the worst curses, that are highly unlikely to ever have a non-Dark use, would be made Unforgivable.\n\n\u201cNow \u2026 those three curses \u2013 Avada Kedavra, Imperius and Cruciatus \u2013 are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban.\u201d - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 14 (The Unforgivable Curses)\n\nNow, would Sectumsempra fit the criteria for being made an Unforgivable Curse?\nProbably not - it cuts through things like a sword. It can be used for anything a sword, knife or other cutting tool can be used for. While using it on people might be considered Unforgivable, the spell itself is simply the act of cutting. There are many things a wizard might reasonably want to cut with no malicious intent; vegetables, rope, cloth, building materials. Because of this, it seems unlikely that even if the Ministry had known about it, it would be classified as an Unforgivable Curse.\nIn addition, there is a countercurse for Sectumsempra.\n\n\u201cPushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand and traced it over the deep wounds Harry\u2019s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy\u2019s face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting. - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 24 (Sectumsempra)\n\nWhile the wounds from Sectumsempra can't be healed by simple healing spells, they can in fact be healed by the countercurse.\nSo - Sectumsempra likely wouldn't be made Unforgivable if the Ministry knew it."], "source": "stackexchange", "questioner": "A passionate Harry Potter fan with a deep interest in the lore and mechanics of the magical world created by J.K.

{"conversations": ["My cat keeps scratching up my furniture. What are some ways to train her to stop?", "Cats scratch furniture for a variety of reasons, so you'll have to work out why yours is scratching in particular. It's usually because it wants to claw off old nail sheaths, or because it wants to mark its territory. Here are a number of things you can do to train her not to scratch your furniture.\n\nFirst, you can trim her nails regularly. If you trim your cat's nails regularly, then it will be less likely for her to want to scratch because it will be more uncomfortable for her to do so. Plus, it will reduce the damage done by scratching because the claws won't be as sharp.\n\nSecond, you can cover the areas with something unpleasant, like tin foil or double-sided tape. This should discourage her from scratching there, and she'll (hopefully) learn to go to her scratching post instead.\nThird, you can try to redirect her attention when she starts to scratch where she shouldn't. If you catch her in the act, make a loud noise (clapping is good) and she should stop. Then, if you have a scratching post nearby, encourage her to scratch there instead. Give her a treat if she scratches the post, or praise her verbally. She'll learn that scratching the post gets her good things, while scratching the furniture gets her nothing.\n\nFinally, you can try a combination of all of the above. Trim her nails, cover the furniture, and when you catch her scratching the furniture, clap your hands and show her the scratching post.\n\nWith consistent effort, you should be able to break her furniture-scratching habit. It may take a few weeks, but it can be done.\n"], "source": "authors", "questioner": "A pet owner who is experiencing issues with their feline companion damaging household items.

This iconic North American climb is a 1200 ft (364 m) multi-pitch alpine trad route with 18 pitches, rated as Grade III. It is a famous alpine rock route, not just in Washington, but nationally. First ascended by John Rupley & Don Gordon (1956) [Great Gendarme] and James Wickwire & Fred Stanley (1964), it's a must-do for alpine rock enthusiasts.\n\nRoute Overview:\nFrom the Stuart Glacier notch, approximately 11 pitches of low/mid 5th class climbing lead to the Gendarme's base. Despite the enjoyable exposed climbing, the Gendarme features the most remarkable pitches. Two crux 5.9 pitches await, with the first being a steep dihedral offering good rests between challenging sections. Traverse to the offwidth, power through it, and tackle one more 5.8-5.9 pitch before the final three pitches of low 5th.\n\nEquipment:\nGear preferences vary. Carry your usual equipment for long alpine rock routes. If you want extra security in the cruxy 5.9 offwidth, carry one 3.5\" piece. You may need an ice axe and crampons if you approach via the glacier. \n\nGetting there:\nDrive I-90 to exit 85, turn left to join SR-970. Drive 6.6 mi and turn left on Teanaway River Road. Follow north fork road approximately 23 mil to the end of road.\n\nApproach and Descends:\nMultiple approach options exist, each with pros and cons. Either approach from the south via Longs Pass TH or from the north via Mountaineer Creek. Acquire a topographic map to determine the best route. If approaching from LPTH, head to Ingalls Lake, traverse ledges around the lake's east side, follow the trail to Stuart Pass, and descend northwest on talus. Ascend more talus to Goat Pass, traverse Stuart Glacier, and reach the 4th class gully leading to the North Ridge's prominent notch, marking the beginning of the upper ridge. If descending via LPTH, head down from the summit towards the false summit via blocky terrain, follow cairns and a ledge system east, and descend the seemingly endless Cascadian Couloir, eventually reaching Ingalls Creek.\nScramble to the false summit. Descend steep snow or scree then keep right through sparse trees to enter the Cascadian Couloir. Descend all the way  to the valley floor, and then you can go back to via Long\u2019s peak or Ingalls Lake. \n\nThis route is incredible and a must-do for anyone at ease with alpine rock climbing at this level. Keep in mind, though, that it's quite challenging and requires serious commitment.
