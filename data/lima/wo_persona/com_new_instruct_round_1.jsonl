I have found a workaround by manually adding the shared folder into the TypeScript compiler, but I am seeking an elegant solution that would allow Visual Studio Code to recognize the shared code for features like intellisense without requiring constant updates or compromising the modular structure of the project, while also ensuring that the shared code is accessible across all sub-projects.
